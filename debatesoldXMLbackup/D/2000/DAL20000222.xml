    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 38, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to my statement to the House on Tuesday, 15 February last. In the period leading up to and since the suspension of the Assembly and the Executive, I have been in constant contact with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair and have had a number of meetings with the leaders of Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In London last Wednesday, the Prime Minister and I met jointly with Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP to discuss the current difficulties. I firmly believe that both the operation of the institutions and the disposal of arms under the mandate of the International Commission on Decommissioning should proceed. The Prime Minister and I are both convinced there is no reasonable alternative to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>We also agreed that pending the re-establishment of the institutions, we will continue to implement resolutely all the outstanding elements of it within our responsibility. From time to time in this process, it is inevitable that there will be differences of emphasis between the participants on what approach should be taken in particular circumstances. This has happened in the past and undoubtedly it will happen in the future. What is important now is how to proceed from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governments and the parties will continue <Col N="1240" /> to work to achieve a successful outcome. The way forward should be based on the three principles agreed by the parties on 25 June which were incorporated into the Mitchell review report on 18 November last. They provide that we work towards getting devolved governments through an inclusive executive, decommissioning of all paramilitary arms under the mandate of the International Commission on Decommissioning and decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the international commission. From the various meetings which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I had with all of the parties last week, I believe there is a willingness and an intention to proceed on that basis. If we continue on that path, we can work matters out from this point. I have had a number of telephone conversations with President Clinton and will continue to keep him fully informed of the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal and constitutional issues, I would again refer Deputies to my statement of last Tuesday. We will carefully consider how best to proceed in these matters, including how we proceed in regard to the North/South and British-Irish institutions.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 8 February, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Mr. Robert Stoker, accompanied by Mr. Robert Saulters, the Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, and Mr. Frank McCoubrey of the UDP paid a courtesy call to me in Government Buildings. The meeting provided a useful opportunity for me to hear their views on matters of mutual interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the IRA offer, which was conveyed to General de Chastelain on the Friday on which the suspension occurred, was sufficiently clear-cut to ensure that Ulster Unionist Ministers would not resign? When was that offer presented to General de Chastelain? Did he get it before or after the suspension? Has the Taoiseach obtained information from Sinn Féin on why this offer was presented so late, on the Friday before what was known to be a crucial meeting on Saturday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The offer, which has since been withdrawn, was, as I said last week, a substantive one. It went a considerable distance, although, as I also said last week, it did not seek full clarity. It was, however, a significant move. I am not sure what time of the day the offer was presented. I understand it was made by telephone. It was certainly made during the course of the day, not after the suspension. It was made more formally after the suspension as further meetings were held. My officials spent 13 days working to avoid the &ldquo;last hour&rdquo; syndrome, but that did not prove possible. Ultimately, this created a difficulty because there was too much too achieve on the last day. If it had happened two weeks earlier, we may have overcome the difficulties on which we had been trying to make progress since November. I and others made a number of statements here, in South Africa and elsewhere on this issue. <Col N="1241" /> Two weeks previously I asked my officials to go to Derry to start a process which went on for 13 days. Waiting for the last day was clearly unhelpful. I do not know why that happened. I can only assume people had not cleared their minds and perhaps still have not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach consider that making an offer so late, on the day before a crucial meeting, and giving it confidentially to the Prime Ministers only was designed not to allow the other parties examine it sufficiently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. It was a process of push and shove for two weeks to reach a final position. The offer was not intentionally made at the last hour. That would not have been consistent with what had happened previously. My officials and I saw it as our task to achieve movement. Efforts were made hourly and daily. These things tend to happen &ndash; even if one does not get all the progress one needs, it still comes too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the IRA offer was a substantive one and went a considerable distance. He did not say, however, it would have been sufficient to prevent the resignation of Ministers that evening or the following day. Is it the view of the Taoiseach and the Government that suspension was preferable to resignation or<i> vice versa</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put it in those terms because I did not see it that way. The Government was trying to get movement from the IRA so the statement by General de Chastelain on 31 January would be substantive and would allow room for everyone, not least the UUP, to make progress. The deadline of 31 January came and discussions went on into the early hours of the morning. The discussions that night continued until approximately 3 a.m. and we continued for another ten or 12 days to try to make progress. The Irish Government and I were in favour of working towards a review without a suspension. That would have been consistent with the constitutional position and the terms of the British-Irish Agreement. It is my view and I believe the view of the British Government that if the move which took place happened a few days earlier, we would have achieved this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to ask the Taoiseach a question on defining where we are now so that there is clarity and respect for a shared analysis. Second, will he confirm the analysis I will put to him? Am I correct in stating that the position now is that the institutions have been suspended, the Unionist participants feel they cannot resume participation in those institutions until they are <Col N="1242" /> satisfied progress has been made on the issue of putting arms beyond use, the IRA and Sinn Féin have removed their interlocutor or representative from the only body that can determine whether progress is being made, that is, the de Chastelain Commission, and in the absence of that link being re-established, we are at a point where we cannot make progress because the mechanism for that progress depends on some communication being conveyed to the de Chastelain Commission which, in turn, can give a third report from 11 February which would enable the other participants to the process to have sufficient confidence to resume their participation? Is this a fairly accurate description of where we are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The part of the analysis with which I do not agree is that the report will be the third one. It will be the Commission's fifth report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that clarification. Following the Taoiseach's discussions with the British Government, the President of the United States and his own officials who have been working tirelessly on this issue, what proposals, if any, have the two Governments, which were the co-signatories to the Good Friday Agreement together with the parties in Northern Ireland, to make progress in relation to the difficulties I have described and which he has accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many ideas but whether they become proposals is another matter. The British and Irish Governments have agreed to continue to implement the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement which come within our remit. All the parties said last week that this would give them the confidence and determination to keep on working at this issue. We must construct some mechanism to re-establish the institutions while at the same time dealing with the issue of putting arms beyond use. We cannot do this on our own. However, the consultation process, to which we are committed, involves the two Governments and all the parties. I have had many discussions during the past week and I believe people are determined to find a mechanism to deal with this matter. It would be wrong for me to say that there is one solution to deal with the problem because this is not the case. However, all the parties have ideas and are determined to solve the problem. I appreciate the fact that the UUP, Sinn Féin and the SDLP have had meetings and dialogue and exchanged phone calls with me. All the parties are not <i>ad idem</i> or going in the same direction, but they are coming forward with ideas and are determined to find a resolution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The current position is not where we want to be, but we can construct something. As I have repeatedly said to the parties, and I restated it in the House, every day we lose on this, makes the situation more difficult. Every day creates a new obstacle and makes anti-Agreement people more determined in their remit. We should be conscious of that.</P>

      <P>I presume the Taoiseach means the components that are not exclusive to Northern Ireland, which constitute a part of the Good Friday Agreement, remain intact and will function and that this includes the North-South bodies between the British and Irish Governments and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in relation to activities with their counterparts in the Stormont Administration.

Will the Taoiseach outline whether the Government protested to the British Government at that time and informed it of the constitutional and legal difficulties such a suspension would cause?

        <b>: </b>Will the Taoiseach agree that in relation to taking the gun and violence out of life in Northern Ireland there are three main planks which should be advanced? Will he agree that dismantling the whole apparatus of repression built up by the British state over 30 years, including dismantling the ugly army fortresses across the North, should be carried out forthwith? This would assist the position immensely. Will he agree that implementation of radical changes in policing, involving placing the police under democratic community control, as an unarmed force, would assist the position? Will he agree that disbanding all the paramilitary organisations on all sides which do not have the democratic support of a majority of either or any community, North or South, would also be crucial? Will he agree that those three planks being pushed together &ndash; though one is not conditional on another &ndash; would create a situation for an entirely new development in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of demilitarisation whether it is in south Armagh or elsewhere. I have raised this issue continuously particularly with regard to communities where <Col N="1245" /> there has not been any violence or activities of note for several years. That would help. That is one of the aspects I refer to as we try to implement the Good Friday Agreement in full. On the second point, the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, has moved substantially on the implementation programme for Patten. As it progresses during the year it will give an enormous confidence boost, particularly, to the Nationalist community who want to see radical changes. Recently Mr. Mandelson reiterated strongly his statements of last autumn that he is prepared to listen. I agree with that. On the third point, I agree that arms, all kinds of paramilitary arms, all shows of strength and force need to be taken away. That also applies to people who want to be in Government. If people want to be part of the Executive, which is part of democracy &ndash; I am sorry if I have to keep on saying this and it annoys people &ndash; the reality is that if one wants to be part of a democracy, for a short period one can continue to have a private army, but one cannot have that in the long-term. That has to be resolved as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>That is fair enough. Obviously, they said the opposite when they met me a year ago.</P>
      <P>In his discussions with the British Prime Minister, has the Taoiseach raised the destruction of some of the weapons used on Bloody Sunday, in view of the likelihood that those weapons would be very important evidence in the Saville inquiry? If so, what answer has he got from the British Prime Minister as to how weapons which were of importance to an inquiry which is of great importance to reconciliation on this island could have been put beyond evidential examination?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has raised the constitutional issue regarding suspension of the Assembly. In view of the Government's clear obligation under Article 6.2 of the Constitution, what steps are being taken by the Government with regard to this matter, given the Taoiseach's stated belief that the procedures adopted contradict our Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not spoken about the arms used on Bloody Sunday. Last year we had considerable discussion about a day of reconciliation or an act of reconciliation in which we would all involve ourselves and to which we would all contribute. This act of reconciliation <Col N="1247" /> would include arms from all those involved. Those discussions almost came to fruition during Holy Week of 1999 when there was an attempt to hold an act of reconciliation to which everyone would contribute. The British Government was part of that discussion although we did not reach the point where all parties formally agreed to take part. Had agreement been reached by all sides, I believe everyone, including the two Governments would have participated. Unfortunately, one of the parties declined to bring the discussions to fruition and the initiative collapsed. If there was an act of reconciliation I believe the British Government would play its part in it.</P>
      <P>I have examined the constitutional question and I have taken advice on it. At this stage I believe the legislative and constitutional concerns would be best allayed by the speedy restoration of the institutions. If this does not happen after a significant period of time, issues regarding implementation bodies will require careful consideration. However, I do not wish to do anything about that yet.</P>

      <P>Given that there is a shared and agreed description of where we are at present and given that aspects of the Good Friday Agreement will continue to be operated on a bilateral basis between the British and Irish Governments, will the Taoiseach indicate the plans, as distinct from thoughts, he and the British Government have to reconnect the IRA with the independent international decommissioning body on the one hand and the Ulster Unionist Party with the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland on the other? Does he agree it is no longer a private concern of Sinn Féin on the one hand and the Ulster Unionist Party on the other? Will he, therefore, consider, without becoming involved in a formal review process, the desirability of having all the parties to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, including all those parties which are pro-Agreement as well as those which are not necessarily pro-Agreement, gather together for a round table meeting of some form to see if they can collectively find a way out of this difficulty, the description of which has been accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is also our analysis and what is required of the two Governments and all the parties which negotiated the Good Friday Agreement. It might even extend beyond those which are members of the assembly to parties such as the UDP which also played a valuable role. That process has started, although we have yet to reach the stage of round table discussions. There were meetings before the weekend and there are further meetings today. When there were difficulties in recent years the collective efforts of the party leaderships proved very useful. They are all determined to assist in finding a way forward. The main players will have to contribute to any analysis reached. We have not yet reached that stage but it is possible to get there.</P>

Does he draw considerable strength from their support for his continuing efforts to implement all aspects of the Agreement? I have had the privilege of having a democratic mandate for almost 35 years. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the Agreement, as Deputy Quinn said, does not belong to any two parties but to all elected representatives? Is he encouraged by the support of all democratically elected representatives in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere, as evidenced by the unanimous support at the recent conference of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, for his consistent and unremitting efforts and those of the British Prime Minister?

There can hardly be anything stronger in terms of a democratic mandate, but there is still a difficulty and I do not want to play it down in any way. There was an assembly, an executive, North-South bodies and institutions which were working very well and now we have nothing. I am not here to say that everything is rosy; it is not. There is a need for the two Governments and the parties to find a way forward and ultimately to get the institutions back up and running. We are back where we started. We need clarity on how we can resolve these issues on a time scale If the time scale is not the exact time scale that was there before, we need to work out and agree between the parties another time scale From having talked to all the party leaders and the negotiating bodies over the course of the weekend, I believe that by and large they are prepared to support an agreement &ndash; it may not be all that they want &ndash; providing it is clear what they are agreeing to.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree with me that there is great merit in the suggestion made here earlier by Deputy Quinn to the effect that all the parties should get around the table so that all would have ownership of the problem; and that there would be great merit in bringing General de Chastelain to meet all of the parties in order that all of the parties together can see the full extent of the problem rather than have the matter dealt with by communications by the Government with Sinn Féin and by the British Government with the Unionists with everybody else cut out of the loop in a fashion which breeds frustration and suspicion?</P>
      <P>Why has the Taoiseach not yet raised with the British Prime Minister the destruction of weapons which were used on Bloody Sunday which would be important for forensic examination by the Saville inquiry; and will he raise that matter with him?

Will he and Deputy Bruton and others note that it is my view and the view of Sinn Féin that full demilitarisation, including the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons, is both achievable and desirable?</P>

      <P>That is part of the difficulty. When an institution is set up, one can get people to participate in that, as I have worked to try to do, on the basis that other issues of armed forces would be dealt with at a later date. We have not achieved that. When we deal with that, then we have solved the problem. I do not think that it is fair of Deputy Ó Caoláin to turn back the question and say he is in the House on a democratic mandate. Of course he is here on a democratic mandate, but there is another part of the problem to resolve. He knows what that problem is. That is why I cannot convince people that they are safe in the Executive or institutions because there is a link to people who are armed and that is part of the problem. That is why the institutions, the Executive, the Assembly, the North-South bodies, the Intergovernmental Conference are all suspended, much as I disagree with it and much as I fought that it should not happen. I totally accept that he and his colleagues in the political wing are endeavouring to assist, but it is part of the problem and the Deputy has to acknowledge that as much as I have to acknowledge other things. That is a valid point.</P>
      <P>On legislation, I have already stated that we are looking at the legislative base. If the suspension continued indefinitely, we would have to look at the legislative position. I have already stated that we are looking at that matter. The Deputy asked me a third question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime.</P>
      <P>I have decided to make changes in the system which operates in Ireland to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota on a permanent basis at a reasonable cost in the coming years and that the Irish dairy sector is positioned to face the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>On 13 October, I announced my intention to introduce, by way of national regulations, applicable from 1 April 2000, an arrangement for the transfer of milk quota other than the current system whereby such quota transfers with land. The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime; greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers; the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible and greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of Article 8 of the European Community regulations, I have decided that with effect from 1 April 2000 milk quota will no longer transfer with land, subject to certain exceptions. Those exceptions will cover family transactions, renewals of existing leases between the original lessor and lessee, sale of a dairy holding as a going concern and the transfer by way of lease or sale of land purchased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000. Detailed conditions in relation to these exceptions will be defined in the national regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the exceptions outlined above I have decided that, under the provisions of Article 8(b), the transfer of milk quota will be through a scheme to be operated by way of a pooled system at co-operative or dairy level. Under this scheme, quota holders may, at the end of each milk quota year, offer all or part of their milk quota for sale to their co-operative or dairy. The co-operative or dairy, in turn, may sell milk quota only to pro<Col N="1253" /> ducers attached to that concern on the basis of priority categories and detailed rules which will be determined in advance.</P>
    <P>The maximum price for the sale of milk quota under this scheme will also be fixed at national level and priority will be afforded to small and medium size producers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In this regard, I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Finance of favourable tax treatment in the purchase of quota. This will enable his scheme to operate all the more effectively.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000, it will be no longer possible for quota holders, not engaged in milk production, to temporarily lease their milk quota under the provisions of Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92 and Regulation 16 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, where the milk quota has been temporarily leased for the preceding three milk quota years (1997/98, 1998/99 and 1999/2000) or for a longer period.</P>
    <P>In cases other than these it will be open to quota holders to offer all or part of their quota into the temporary leasing scheme, which will continue to operate after 1 April 2000. The maximum price of quota under the scheme will continue to be set at national level. As in the past, the milk quota review group will be consulted in relation to that as well as in relation to establishing the priority criteria for producers purchasing quota under the scheme. I have consulted widely before taking these decisions and I believe they have the support of those involved in industry.</P>

Will the Minister outline his proposals in the House before the legislation is brought into being on 1 April, so that every Deputy can be involved? We owe it to all dairy farmers, new entrants, quota holders who do not supply milk and dairy processors to have a debate on those proposals. What is wrong is that nobody knows what is happening? The Minister might indicate if he is prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>The reason for the provision on selling farms as going concerns is that if a person buys a farm, he or she will want to know if the quota goes with it.

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the penalties for errors in applications for direct payments are excessive; the plans, if any, he has to instigate a review in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5060/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the need to simplify the application and processing arrangements for the various direct payment schemes and to ensure penalties are kept to a minimum both from a customer service viewpoint and the importance of direct payments to farm incomes. In the course of the negotiations on the detailed rules for implementing the Agenda 2000 changes and in the discussions on changes to the integrated administration and control regulations, Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development officials raised the question of simplification and proportionality of penalties. Some success was achieved in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am committed, under the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to pressing the European Commission to re-examine the penalty regime with particular reference to exclusion penalties applicable to direct payment schemes, and to apply the maximum proportionality in the imposition of all penalties.</P>
      <P>The number of livestock applications which attracted penalties under the 1998 headage and premium schemes represented 2.6% of the 522,000 applications received in that year. In the case of REPS, 2% to 3% of applicants would have attracted penalties of 20% of aid. Therefore, this issue has to be kept in proportion and in context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, two thirds of penalties applied under the headage and premium schemes were attributable to late submissions, that is, late applications by farmers. A further number arose because of a shortfall in the number of eligible animals found by my Department in the course of on-farm inspections. The number of applications which attracted a one or two year penalty, that is, false declaration, intentionally or through serious negligence, represented no more than 0.1% of applications in the 1998 scheme year. The bulk of these applied in the sheep sector. A one year penalty would apply in cases where, for example, a proportion of ewes applied on are found not to be ewes at inspection. A two year penalty would <Col N="1256" /> apply where, for example, a farmer made application for premium or headage on sheep which he did not have at the time of application or at time of inspection.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In general, where an applicant makes an error in the completion of an application form, my Department allows an opportunity to correct such errors. The most common error over the past few years has been the incorrect transcription of tag numbers on application forms. The level of such errors has, however, greatly decreased in the past year following the more widespread use of new information technology in the processing of the special beef premium scheme whereby farmers are no longer required to list the individual ear tag number of all animals being applied on.</P>
    <P>Given the overall value of these direct payments to farmers and the fact that that value is set to increase following from the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, it is inevitable that the Commission will wish to ensure reasonable levels of controls are in place in the various member states.</P>
    <P>Since January 1999 greater emphasis has been placed on the need for farmers to fully respect the regulatory requirements for the identification and registration of bovine animals. These requirements are particularly important in the context of traceability and the national beef assurance scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the all-party Oireachtas committee which examined the provision of quality customer service by his Department was not impressed with it? Does he also accept it recommended the establishment of a properly resourced independent appeals system? Will he agree that the committee found it was the complexity of the forms used in the various schemes that caused the greatest headache and that the forms were not user-friendly? Does he accept there is a failure to use clear and unambiguous language in the forms? I preface my remarks by saying I was pulled up for not asking questions and, as a lawyer&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I was embarrassed by that. Does the Minister accept that the establishment of a forms audit agency which could notify farmers waiting seven days whether the form was correctly completed would be a step in the right direction to minimise the penalties that apply? Does he accept that the principle of proportionality enunciated by the European Court of Justice has not been heard of by the mandarins in his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of premia and headage to farmers impinges on a number of agencies. On the one hand, the Oireachtas com<Col N="1257" /> mittee, which the Deputy mentioned, wants the processing of payments to be made more simple, streamlined and efficient while, on the other hand, the Committee of Public Accounts want control, audit, supervision and accountability in respect of such payments.</P>
      <P>Given that very large sums of money are paid to farmers under these schemes, there must be accountability but there must also be balance and fairness. The proportionality of penalties under the schemes is out of kilter. The penalty whereby farmers in some cases are denied full payment for one or two years is too great. Given that these penalties are written into the regulations, this is not only a national problem. I have pressed the European Commission to ensure that the penalties are diluted, fairer and have a sense of balance and proportionality. I have given that commitment to the House.</P>
      <P>I have given a commitment to the House to establish an appeals unit, with an independent supporting staff and all that goes with that. That is being established and provisions made for it with the Attorney General's office at present. Having regard to the establishment of the independent unit, improvements in EU regulations and improvements in the processing of application forms, which we together with the farming organisations are seeking to simplify, improvements in technology and a major improvement in the way forms have been completed and returned to the Department, I expect there will be a major improvement in the operation of these schemes. That is important as direct payments account for, on average, 57% of farmers' incomes.</P>

I would like the Minister of State to reassure Members and the public that all imported food complies with the provisions of the food quality assurance scheme? Will he ensure such a provision is included in the new Bill?</P>

      <P>I will deal with the last part of the Deputy's question first. The National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill was passed last week and it will be signed into law shortly by the President. That scheme will address concerns in this area in the production sector.</P>
      <P>I do not have responsibility for the matter referred to by the Deputy but I do not want to avoid answering his question. The dioxins scare and all such scares are alarming but they are a matter for the Food Safety Authority. As the Deputy is aware, certain EU rules and regulations deal with this matter. We have witnessed the terrible impact of the fallout from the dioxin scare in Belgium on its farmers and processors. Given the strict procedures that have been put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Ireland is safe from dioxin and other dangers, including ecoli 0157. Those procedures have been upheld. People are often annoyed at the regulations and standards that apply to production but such procedures have protected Irish farmers and the processing industry from these problems. I know the Deputy supports such procedures because of the way he has worded his question. They are vital if we are to protect the food industry which last year yielded £5.2 billion in revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy for food safety contained in the White Paper envisages a comprehensive, coherent approach, which will serve to bolster public confidence in European food safety controls and, as such, will benefit both consumer and producer. This approach is very neces<Col N="1260" /> sary in the wake of a number of difficulties in relation to European food in recent years.</P>
      <P>The proposals provide for the establishment of an independent European food safety authority, which would have the key tasks of risk assessment and risk communication. Risk management functions are to remain with the member states and will be controlled under a common EU framework. This framework will cover the whole of the food chain including animal feed. It will operate on the principle that responsibility for food safety rests with feed manufacturers, farmers and food manufacturers/operators to ensure traceability from &ldquo;farm to fork&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the White Paper that I welcome is the enhanced role envisaged for the Food and Veterinary Office which is located in this country. The threat of withdrawal of EU funds to which the Deputy refers, arises in the context of the strengthening of functions of this office. The detail of this proposal has yet to be fully debated and finalised. I would take the view, however, that in order to be fully effective and serve the common good there must be an adequate system of redress and accountability.</P>

      <P>In the previous reply and in the reply to this question, the Minister mentioned controls on food production in relation to the Food Safety Authority. Now we are talking about a Europe-wide food safety authority in the new White Paper. In the case of produce coming from the European Union or from third countries, what controls are there in the context of e.coli, dioxins, and so on, risks to which foods are prone at the moment? Has the Minister consulted the European Commissioner in relation to the Beef Assurance Scheme Bill which is currently before the House and which does not seem to include the procedures regarding farm to fork that are being discussed in the White Paper?</P>

      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, I assure the House that we operate all the EU Directives dealing with food. Europe has very high standards in the food area, <Col N="1261" /> some of which are very difficult for producers to operate.</P>
      <P>The Beef Assurance Scheme Bill deals with production at farm level. I assure the House, because there seems to be some misunderstanding, that we have the safest food in the world. We have a good environment. We have everything going for us, provided there is no sabotage or irregularities which are not conducive to good practice. There have been scares, but we have not had e.coli 1057, which we have seen in Scotland and America with substantial loss of life. There is an expert to my left in the House &ndash; I refer to Deputy Mary Upton who is a microbiologist and very familiar with what I am talking about. Ireland is safe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to avoid the question, but the Food Safety Authority is a matter for another Department. Veterinary inspectors are employed under a contractual arrangement between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Food Safety Authority of the Department of Health and Children. Many papers have been delivered by the new Commissioner on this whole area, and the European authority is fairly closely modelled on the Irish one which is a very innovative food safety authority. It is currently at a drafting stage and discussions are taking place. I understand it will not be European law until about 2002.</P>

      <P>Would it not be appropriate to ensure that the European food authority will have the necessary legislative power to arbitrate on scientific disputes between member states, particularly, in disputes relating to the ingredients in foods that are crossing borders?

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>At my request, Enterprise Ireland has undertaken an examination of the current structure of the pigmeat processing sector to establish whether further investment is necessary. This study will examine the adequacy of the current slaughtering and processing capacity of the sector nation-wide. The study will also assess the suitability of this capacity and its adequacy in terms of the location of pig production in the Thirty-two Counties. Following agreement with the Northern Ireland authorities, the study is being carried out in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Development Board to ensure a full picture of the all-Ireland situation is established.</P>
      <P>The number of EU export approved slaughtering plants has increased in recent years, offering additional outlets to pig producers for their animals. Pig slaughterings last year were nearly 8% ahead of those in 1998. My Department is monitoring the slaughtering situation and there is no evidence that producers are encountering backlogs in having their pigs slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marketing of pigmeat is a matter for the industry supported by an Bord Bia. I have asked An Bord Bia and the pigmeat processors to spare no effort in developing and exploiting new markets and also in ensuring that the home market is sup<Col N="1263" /> plied where possible by domestically produced pigmeat.</P>
    <P>I have taken a number of significant measures to help pigmeat producers since the difficulties began. I, together with my colleagues in other member states, sought and obtained increases in export refunds on a number of occasions in both 1998 and 1999. In addition, agreement was secured from the EU Commission for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme. This scheme removed more than 428,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market. The Commission also introduced a Food Aid Programme for Russia, and nearly 60,000 tonnes of pigmeat was sent to that country under the programme. I will continue to press the Commission to increase export refunds, with a view to getting more product off the market. On the supply front I, along with many of my colleagues at Council, have been pressing the Commission for some time now to bring forward proposals aimed at curtailing production in the pig sector.</P>
    <P>On the home front, pigmeat prices increased by nearly 18% in 1999, and while this increase is welcome, I consider that many producers are still in difficulties. I have held discussions with the pigmeat processors to discuss the continuing difficulties in the sector. I have also met the banks and feed suppliers, who expressed their support for the pig producers during this difficult period.</P>
    <P>I recently introduced an aid scheme for Border pig producers, who suffered financial losses as a result of getting lower prices for their pigs following the destruction by fire of their main slaughtering outlet in Northern Ireland. The scheme will enable eligible applicants to restructure their bank loans on the basis of a restructuring plan agreed with their bank, and is aimed at enabling them to return to viability as soon as possible. Applications for the scheme are currently being processed, and every effort is being made to make early payments under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the pigmeat market is good. The EU Commission has forecast an increase in pigmeat prices around the middle of this year. The forecast is that overall EU production this year will fall compared to last year. In addition, export markets for Irish pigmeat are predicted to perform strongly this year, which will offer opportunities for Irish processors to increase their exports, and this in turn should lead to higher prices for pigmeat producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the pig processing plants could be the next target for farmers' protests? Is he aware that has been indicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to discussions the Minister had with the banks, can he tell us what they said? Were they prepared to give a six-months' moratorium? Is the Minister aware that pig farmers have incurred £54 million worth of additional debts in the past two years, that 1998 and 1999 in particular were the two worst years on record for pig <Col N="1264" /> farmers? How does the Minister propose to help farmers whose debts have increased by that amount? Has he carried out any study on the differential between what is paid to pig farmers for their product and what the consumer pays for pork in the shops? Such a study might be very revealing. Is there any solace for pig farmers in the recently negotiated new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness?</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the number of pig farmers is effectively halved, while here the number remained static and farmers accumulated debts. Will the Minister agree that following the 7% increase in the price of pigmeat in the USA as a result of a reduction in breeding herds, there is an opportunity for pig processors in such an environment to export more pigmeat products from Ireland because of the product's acceptability in the US market?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that pig producers have gone through unprecedented difficulties in the past two years and that on this occasion the cyclical depression was more pronounced and lasted longer than virtually any of the previous ones. The reason for that was overproduction throughout the EU. During that time, both at EU level and here at home, I did everything possible to alleviate the situation, including the use of export refunds, aid to private storage and food aid to Russia. On the home front, on many occasions I met the banks, feed suppliers and processors. The banks reaffirmed their commitment to see this depressed situation through, along with the pig producers. They discussed the aid scheme for the Border counties with the pig producers' representatives and agreed to process that loan operation and to stick with the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with the Deputy, but that point is for another time. On three previous occasions I heard the Minister say he thought the recession in the pig sector was over, or would be shortly. What factors does the Minister see at the moment that would influence the market so that pig producers could have confidence that their hour in the sun is about to come? We are now down to a figure of about 600 pig producers and the so-called help the Government has given them over the past two years has been out of all proportion to their needs &ndash; in fact, they have received none whatsoever. Of the numbers applying for the loan scheme the Minister introduced, what percentage will receive grant aid? Some of them are cross-subsidising their pig production with dairying or off-farm employment just to keep the pig business going. My understanding is that the Minister has nothing <Col N="1265" /> for that category. Will the Minister indicate how the market has improved so that he can now say pig producers will be back in profitability very shortly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, its forecasting system is based on the numbers in different member states. As the Deputy will recall from my reply, the processing of pigs in Ireland was up by 8% last year, despite the difficulties. It was also up in Spain and in Denmark to some extent, but in the other member states the numbers were down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result, there will be a greater balance in the market which should help prices from the summer onwards. At the last pigmeat management meeting in Brussels there was a proposal that when the upturn occurs, which we all hope will be very soon, a solidarity fund will be provided for Ireland and the other member states. In other words, a voluntary levy would be paid by each milk producer during good times and the fund would be availed of during difficult times in the pig cycle. There has to be a degree of supply control if we want to get out of this upwards cycle and depression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply, although I do not agree with all of it. There is still a major backlog in pig slaughtering. Will the Minister agree that the qualifying conditions for the rescue package, as he calls it, are extremely tight? Is it a fact that unless they are supplying directly to Christmas and Lovell, pig suppliers in the Border region will not qualify? Does the Minister accept that because of that disastrous fire, we had a collapse in the Border region which was greater than anywhere else in the country? The fact that other plants had a glut of pigs has been directly attributed to the fire at Christmas and Lovell. The Minister must bear in mind that farmers were decimated as a result.</P>
      <P>I have met farmers who used their hard-earned savings, accumulated over many years, to keep their pig business going. This is not reflected in the returns from the bank or the miller but, nevertheless, the savings for their families were used up. This concerns brothers and sisters who had long left the family home. Will the Minister say when the first part of the rescue package will reach these hard-pressed people? It is an extremely important question.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept it is totally unrealistic to ask people for dockets from agents who supplied factories, showing exactly the price the agents received? We are living in cloud cuckoo land. A sizeable number of farmers will get no aid from this rescue package. Does the Minister also accept that a pig farm with 100 sows that had £120,000 of debts, either to the banks or jointly to the banks and meal companies, could no longer be in business? Therefore, the criteria the Minister has laid down cannot be met by many of these people who deserve the minimum £12,000 figure. Does the Minister accept that the sum of £1 million represents less than 20% of what is needed?</P>

Four tenders have been received to carry out that study which should be undertaken in about two months' time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the practice of disposal under strict conditions of the carcases of BSE suspect animals on farms. The only BSE-related burials which take place involve individual suspect animals from which the heads have first been removed and taken for laboratory examination. Such burials take place on the farm of origin, not on landfill sites. In excess of 50% of all suspects buried on farms prove negative for BSE.</P>
      <P>When a BSE suspect has been confirmed positive after laboratory examination of brain tissue, the remaining animals in the herd are slaughtered at a designated plant, rendered and destroyed. None of this material is buried on farms or landfill sites.</P>
      <P>In all cases of burial the rules of regulation 4 of Statutory Instrument 257 of 1994 must be followed. Under these provisions, if multiple carcases are involved, the local health board and the local authority must rule on the suitability of the proposed site. If a single carcase is involved the district veterinary office is empowered to make the decision.</P>
      <P>Suspect carcases are buried under licence from my Department and under the direct supervision of a departmental veterinarian. This officer ensures that the site is located away from water courses; the hole is dug to a depth of ten feet; the head is removed at the edge of the hole and any contaminated soil is buried; and the carcase is covered in quicklime before being covered in soil.</P>
      <P>A preferred option for disposal of BSE suspect carcases would be incineration of the entire carcase. There is, however, no suitable public or commercial incineration facility available in Ireland at present. Consequently, as acknowledged by the relevant EU authorities, there is no immediately available alternative to the disposal of such carcases other than by burial under strict conditions.</P>
      <P>My Department is, however, exploring other options for the disposal of carcases and is anxious to identify and secure feasible arrangements which would enable it to dispense at the earliest opportunity with the need to bury carcases.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State feel it would be appropriate to have a monitoring process in place to determine if there are any problems for a period of years after the burial of material contaminated by BSE? Are there any plans for an incineration facility for Ireland given that, unfortunately, the figures for BSE seem to be on the increase rather than on the decrease, as anticipated?</P>

      <P>Fair enough. What about Ballinasloe? Incineration is the best alternative, but Deputies will be aware that Irish people are very conscious of that system and there is also great opposition to dump systems. I take the point that incineration is ideal and we must look at such a system for the long-term to deal with dead animals, as we cannot continue with the present system.</P>

      <P>Animals are only buried when we have suspects and approximately only half the suspects are found to be positively carrying BSE. Only one animal in each herd is buried at any time. The head is removed and the animal is buried &ndash; I have outlined the burial procedures. The other half are not infected; the exact figures are 449 were buried and there were 647 carcases in total, so roughly half of those showing up are being positively identified as having BSE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the European Commission to finalise the guidelines for the new rural development initiative, Leader+, very shortly following on the recent receipt of the observations of the European Parliament. Further consultation is taking place this week with member states and this should open the way to early approval of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. In addition, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Task Force on the Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems requires that attention be given to avoiding overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically. I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes. Every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures. In this context, it may be possible to progress the mainstream Leader measure which will apply nationwide at a more rapid rate than Leader+ will allow and I am examining this possibility. In the meantime, I have allocated funding to Comhar Leader <i>inter alia</i> to ensure that existing groups are fully fam<Col N="1270" /> iliar with the administrative requirements regarding mandatory financial reporting of the conclusion of Leader II projects.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has allocated money to bring existing Leader groups up to speed on what is happening. Does he accept that the Leader I and Leader II programmes have both done tremendous work in generating thousands of jobs, in identifying economic initiatives and going after them and in giving rural areas a certain degree of self-confidence that many of them lacked heretofore? Does he agree that it is crucial when Leader+ comes on stream, and I am anticipating that it will get the go ahead, that there is no lapse or time lag? Whatever kind of modified Leader programme comes on stream, it must do so immediately after the expiry of the existing Leader II programme. Above all, staff should not be laid off. There are considerable numbers of staff involved in these programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy and I agree with him about Leader, that the animation during the programme was very good in developing communities. However, there is one problem about guaranteed continuity. If we invite people to tender and then pay them before the tendering system is over, there is then an acceptance that they should get the tender. That is a legal difficulty. While the vast majority of Leader groups are good, it is well known that there have been problems with a few. It is our intention to make sure that as many people as possible can apply. The Government is putting £55 million into our own continuing Leader activities rather than the Leader+. The word &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; is being used about Leader+; I do not know how innovative it can be, but that will be discussed by the STAR committee in Europe and we hope to receive guidelines on it. There will be four types of proposal suggested for Leader+ that we will have to look at. We will have further consultations with the groups and Comhar Leader and send our findings back to Brussels. In the meantime we hope to get the ordinary Leader programme going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The processing time for applications for the scheme of early retirement from farming is determined by a number of factors but primarily by limits on the available human resources and by other pressing demands on the relevant staff. While the processing time varies <Col N="1272" /> from one area to another, there are delays of up to five months in some regions. The closing date for applications under the existing early retirement scheme was 31 December 1999 and in the final weeks of last year the number of new applications was considerably above the average. As a result, there are 556 applications currently on hand.</P>
      <P>The processing of applications is carried out mainly by rural development and environment inspectors and 41 inspectors are currently involved in processing applications. In addition to this work, these inspectors conduct compliance inspections on existing participants in the scheme which are required by the European Commission and are a critical part of the Department's control procedures. The inspectors are also involved in the processing of a proportion of applications for REPS and for the young farmer installation aid scheme, together with the Leader programme.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to reduce the processing time for ERS applications and that a new early retirement scheme forms part of the draft rural development plan for the period 2000-06 which has been submitted to the European Commission and that this new scheme is likely to attract the same level of participation as the existing one. Therefore, I am pursuing the matter of additional resources as a priority in the context of the report of the systems review of my Department and the recently concluded Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. My Department is also actively reviewing its procedures and the available IT resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these questions which emphasise the concern of members of the Irish public about these issues and reinforce the Government's campaign against Sellafield over the past two and a half years.</P>
      <P>The report prepared by the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, on MOX fuel falsification published last Friday by the NII followed the discovery by BNFL in September last that some quality control checks on the fuel manufactured for a Japanese customer had been falsified at the MOX fuel demonstration plant. The NII immediately launched an investigation to establish the extent of the falsification and the causes of the event. The MOX demonstration facility has been closed since these revelations first came to light.</P>
      <P>The NII report requires that the demonstration plant will remain shut down until key recommendations are implemented. The recommendations relate to rectification of quality checking processes and improvement of plant management and operations to bring about the required safety culture at the plant. The fact that the plant is no longer operating at least gives us some reassurance that there is no current risk to Ireland from any of these operations.</P>
      <P>This report is but one of three reports published last Friday by the NII. The other reports concerned reprocessing and associated facilities at Sellafield and the safety of the high level liquid waste stored at the Sellafield plant. The overall impression given by the MOX report and the second report on reprocessing facilities etc. is very damaging to BNFL's reputation. Among the conclusions of the second report is the inspectorate's belief that the site lacks a high quality safety management system. The report goes on to state that the site does not have sufficient resources to implement the existing safety management system and that an effective and competent inspection, auditing and review system within the company is necessary. The inspectorate requires BNFL to produce a programme for responding to the report's recommendations within two months. The inspectorate has also emphasised that if progress is inadequate it will not hesitate to use its enforcement powers.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that Mr. Laurence Williams, the nuclear installations chief inspector, in his press release accompanying the report stated:</P>
      <P>NII is satisfied that the current site operations are safe. However, control and supervision of operations is of paramount importance and we will use our regulatory powers to ensure that the company implements the report's recommendations to reverse the decline in safety performance at the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK Minister, Helen Liddell, is also quoted <Col N="1275" /> as stating on 18 February last that the NII believes the site is safe.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the reports published last Friday have dealt a severe blow to Sellafield. When I received these three reports I took the immediate step of asking the RPII to arrange a meeting with the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate to discuss them. The RPII will report back to me later this evening on its conclusions. This will enable me to determine what further action, if any, I should take on the regulatory follow up measures and enforcement measures being pursued over the two months period by the UK's nuclear inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The report on the storage of high level waste reinforces the Nll's requirement that the waste be vitrified by 2015 at the latest and that BNFL should produce a schedule showing progress. Ireland's concerns about the long-term storage of high level waste in storage tanks at Sellafield have been made known to the UK on numerous occasions through direct ministerial contact and at regular meetings of the Ireland-UK contact group which comprises this Department, the RPII and their UK counterparts.</P>
    <P>In addition to requesting the RPII to meet the NII, I also wrote to the UK Ministers, Helen Liddell and Michael Meacher, expressing the Government's strong concerns about the findings of these reports, particularly the reports on MOX and the general control and supervision of Sellafield. I requested that they give careful consideration to the suspension of operations at the plant at least until the shortcomings at Sellafield had been addressed. I also indicated that I believe there is an onus on the UK Government to demonstrate its regulatory systems are adequate to overcome these problems and sought assurances that the risk to Ireland would be minimised. I am awaiting the response of the UK Government to my correspondence.</P>
    <P>However, the most urgent matter I wish to establish is the RPII's own assessment of the inspectorate's conclusions and its understanding of this approach. The UK inspectorate has a strong independent mandate and in its recent actions it has shown itself to be determined in the fulfilment of that mandate. However, I must defer final judgment on the NII's conclusions until I get a full report from the RPII of its meeting with the NII and I hear from UK Ministers in the coming days.</P>
    <P>The recent revelations about falsified quality control checks on MOX fuel shipped to Japan from the MOX demonstration plant have raised serious question marks about the viability of the MOX plant. The Japanese market represents a significant share of the projected market for the MOX fuel project and any loss of this market arising from that incident must undermine any economic justification for the plant. I have recently taken up this issue with the UK Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, and I will continue to exert maximum <Col N="1276" /> pressure on the UK to ensure the full commissioning of this plant does not proceed.</P>
    <P>As to radioactive discharges, most notably we have also achieved a new OSPAR strategy which will enable us between now and 2020 to achieve the virtual elimination of discharges into the Irish Sea. It is important to recognise that the UK is preparing a national strategy for discharges of radioactive substances covering the period 2001 to 2020 to meet the objectives of the OSPAR strategy. It expects its national strategy to be published before the end of this year after a full public consultation process.  Allied to this, the UK is also undertaking a full scale review of all radioactive discharges from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured I will not hesitate to undertake appropriate litigation if I believe the UK Government is not complying with the provisions of international law. Unfortunately, the law at present and in particular the EURATOM Treaty, does not provide for the establishment of an international inspectorate which could verify the safety and management of the Sellafield site to the degree that we would wish. EU nuclear countries continue to cherish the sovereignty of their independent nuclear inspectorates. The Government will take whatever steps are feasible to amend the treaty to facilitate the establishment of such an inspectorate though the unanimity provisions of the EURATOM Treaty are a major obstacle.</P>
    <P>I have arranged, however, to ask the Attorney General's office to re-open the issue of scientific evidence of a case against Sellafield and I will also ensure the latest reports are examined closely to see if there are any grounds for legal action.</P>

There are 22 tanks of highly active liquid waste stored at Sellafield and a number of out-of-date magnox reactors &ndash; this is within 100 miles of Dublin. The NII said there is no proper safety culture at the plant and Dr. Tom O'Flaherty of the RPII stated that Irish people's fears concerning the plant are well-founded. Given all of this and the litany of lies, deceit and cover-ups by the nuclear authorities and the British Government, does the Minister of State agree his response, requesting a temporary closure of the plant, is inadequate? Does he agree that what is required is a demand for the permanent closure of the plant, backed up by legal action and international diplomatic and publicity offensives? I ask the Minister of State to stop pussyfooting around with British Nuclear Fuels and tell it what this Parliament thinks of what it is doing. Will he take the issue off the back burner where he firmly placed it when he entered office and attend to the clearly well-founded fears of Irish people?</P>

      <P>I quoted from the independent body which reported on this matter, as I thought <Col N="1277" /> it prudent to put it on the record. Deputy Stagg knows what is involved &ndash; the fears regarding the storage of high level waste at Sellafield. We have repeatedly raised this matter with the UK authorities. Storage of high level waste was established by the RPII as a major concern during Deputy Stagg's tenure as Minister. We are concerned about it as a potential risk to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quoting, I was just reminding myself. The Minister of State said that appropriate litigation would be considered. Is he aware that he was quoted in a weekend news<Col N="1278" /> paper as having said he had approached the Attorney General some time ago for an up-date on his advice in relation to Sellafield? Has that advice been made available and is the Attorney General treating the matter with the urgency it requires? Will the Minister of State further agree that what we have already heard from the two Radiological Institute of Ireland officials who are in Sellafield is another good reason for this House to be extremely concerned about this development? Instead of writing to the British Minister responsible, the Minister of State should have been on the &ldquo;blower&rdquo; as soon as this report appeared in order to have immediate consultations with that Minister on what the British Government intends to do about the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in relation to people's concerns. I share his concern. I have articulated this at every opportunity at international fora, at ministerial level and official level and I will continue to do so. I have told British Ministers, including the Deputy Prime Minister, in the company of ministers from 24 other states, that this Government and the people of Ireland want a total cessation of nuclear activities at Sellafield. This continues to be our demand.</P>
      <P>On my request to the Attorney General to review his advice on this State's taking a case against British Nuclear Fuels, I asked the new incumbent in that office to do this some months ago and I have again asked that he review the situation and his advice to me in the context of the revelations of last Friday.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's affirmation of Government policy to demand the closure of the Sellafield plant. However, with all due respect to the Minister and Minister of State, would they accept that the time for polite letters to junior British Ministers is long past? Will the Minister of State ask the Taoiseach to call a special Anglo-Irish summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister to present the demand of the Irish people for the closure of this potential Chernobyl? Will he consider also the proposal that the Irish Government, recognising the universality of this demand, should call a national and international day of action to enable ordinary Irish people and their friends and supporters in other countries to come on the streets and demonstrate their support for the closure of Sellafield? I assure the Minister of State of my full support and the support of my party for such an initiative. Does he accept that we need to see an international diplomatic offensive since this plant threatens not just Ireland and Britain but people throughout the globe as material from it is transported by sea to distant lands? We in the immediate area run the risk of fall-out from any accident that might happen. This would not be confined to our shores in terms of its real effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I am dealing with the <Col N="1279" /> appropriate UK Ministers and will continue to do so. As I said earlier, I have taken up the matter of MOX, which I vigorously oppose, directly with the appropriate level of Government, that is, the Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott. I wrote him a lengthy and detailed letter on the matter on 23 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach publicly enunciated his position on the matter earlier today. He has already raised this issue with the British Prime Minister and he has repeatedly emphasised the serious concern of the Government, Parliament and the people on the ground in relation to the entire range of activities at Sellafield. I am sure he will continue to bring this issue to the attention of the Prime Minister. In the meantime, I will continue to vigorously maintain and drive the Government's policy on the issue.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is starkly lacking in vigorous action compared to other important issues such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which the Taoiseach took on hand. According to reports under the Freedom of Information Act, it appears the Taoiseach last raised the issue in November 1998. Does the Minister of State believe this is sufficiently frequent?</P>
      <P>In light of the contamination of the Irish Sea and sea water with high levels of technetium 99 lapping against the shores of my constituency, will the Minister of State accept that the new MOX plant constitutes a significant new modification of the Sellafield site and will he use his own regulatory powers, which he referred to in his reply, to require at least suspension of operations until an environmental impact statement on Sellafield is undertaken? In relation to legal action, is it true that the last time the Minister of State or his officials met with STAD, the Dundalk residents, was six months ago, in spite of frequent requests for meetings? Will a meeting be facilitated immediately in light of the escalation of concerns regarding Sellafield? Is it true that not a penny has been given to cover legal costs in the case, in spite of commitments to do so before the last election? </P>
      <P>Has Dr. Gordon Thompson from the USA been in correspondence with the Minister's Department? Has he said he will make himself available, as an international expert in decommissioning of nuclear plants, in turning Sellafield from a threat and a producer of toxic nuclear waste into a workforce that can help the decommissioning of that and other dangerous and aging nuclear installations in Britain and around the world? Would he be prepared to meet with Dr. Thompson immediately to review what the Government can do, but has not done to date, to take definitive legal action to close the Sellafield plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have met Dr. Gordon Thompson. I was very impressed with his nuclear grand bargain, as he <Col N="1280" /> termed it. I put the nuclear grand bargain theory to the UK authorities last May when I met the then Energy Minister, John Battle. It was an item on the lengthy formal agenda and during our discussions I asked him to consider taking up the proposals put to us by Dr. Thompson in his nuclear grand bargain theory.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that technetium is part of the successful outcome of the OSPAR Convention talks. We have commitments from British Ministers regarding substantial reductions in discharges of technetium 99. I considered this important because of the escalation in the level of that element in our waters between 1994 and 1999. I have received serious commitments on that matter and I will endeavour to ensure through the OSPAR Convention that those are honoured.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong with regard to STAD. The amount paid to STAD by the Government to date is £145,000. The Deputy is aware that I have authorisation to disburse a total of £400,000. If more money is needed, I will go back to the Cabinet and get it.</P>

I refused to share the platform with those gentlemen on the basis that they had consistently told us lies and half truths. I was criticised at that time but, unfortunately, I have been proved right. Does the Minister of State agree that, as a result of recent <Col N="1281" /> developments, they are liars and telling us half truths? They are telling us the wrong story all the time. Following the most recent developments, how could we possibly trust anything they tell us in the future? The Minister of State should say this to Mr. John Prescott and give them a crash course in telling the truth. Perhaps the Irish people might believe them if that happened. If the four Dundalk people are convinced that they have a case and their legal advice is to that effect, how can the House, with all its legal expertise from the Attorney General down, not find a way to take on the Sellafield matter in the Irish or UK courts or at EU level?</P>

I am concerned about the gap between the falsification issue and the revelations now. I will also tell the appropriate authorities in the UK at ministerial level about this concern. My trust is severely tested at this time.</P>
      <P>I have addressed the position with regard to STAD. The Government undertook to assist financially with the case and it is doing so. I also addressed the Deputy's point about the State taking a legal case.

I always like to be constructive and in circumstances where the British are concerned that the closure of this plant could result in the loss of considerable employment &ndash; I believe up to 20,000 jobs &ndash; will the Minister of State bring to the attention of the British authorities what he, I and other Deputies have said in the House about the grand bargain theory and the role Sellafield might play in cleaning up nuclear waste throughout Europe? This would be a positive suggestion to put at this stage in addition to putting in the boot as hard as possible over the way they have misled the Government and people of this country.</P>

I already mentioned the Taoiseach's involvement. He remains involved and I have no doubt he will up the ante in his way at prime ministerial level in light of last Friday's revelations.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the reports came to me on Friday, I made arrangements for the scientific experts, the RPII, which advises me and the Government, to meet their counterparts at the most senior level of the NII.

Has the Government issued new instructions to our ambassadors to Japan, Switzerland and Germany &ndash; the main customers of Sellafield &ndash; asking them not to buy the product from there? Will the Minister agree, given that we have to bear all the risk associated with nuclear power, without any benefit &ndash; all profits go to the British Government and its agencies &ndash; that action by Ireland can be and has been effective and that we prevented, through direct ministerial action, the building of the underground nuclear dump at Sellafield?</P>

I have already addressed the matter of high level waste which is one of four concerns of the RPII scientific advisers and the <Col N="1284" /> Government.

      <P>My colleague, Deputy McDowell, tabled a number of questions in respect of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which were ruled out of order on the grounds that it anticipates debate. That is in accordance with different precedents which have been established here. I wish to bring to your attention and that of the House the dilemma of the Opposition in respect of this and you may wish to consider it. This item will be debated for 45 minutes on Thursday afternoon and will remain on the Order Paper. As the form of dialogue is one of statements rather than questions and answers, it is impossible, under the ruling of your office, for us to elicit information by way of question. I do not wish to be contentious about this, but I would refer you to the correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle to Deputy McDowell. There are enough restrictions on the Opposition in trying to do its business. I suspect that, on reflection, you may wish to reconsider this decision &ndash; I am trying to deal with this in as pleasant a way as possible. All the Government would need to do would be to leave this item on the agenda, as for example the budget is, and we would, on your ruling, Sir, be debarred from asking question about the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This is unacceptable and I ask you to consider that. Perhaps the Government Whip would communicate with your office, otherwise we are&mdash;</P>

In regard to taxation it gives over £1 billion in personal tax reductions on top of over £1 billion in tax cuts delivered in the Government's first two budgets, it removes over 70,000 from the tax net, including 10,000 over the age of 65, it takes 125,000 taxpayers off the top tax rate by substantially widening the standard rate tax band for single taxpayers and two income married couples, it cuts the standard and top rate of tax by 2% in each case and it increases the basic personal allowances by £500 for a single person and £1,000 for a married couple, so that no PAYE earner enters the tax system until they earn £110 per week or more.</P>
      <P>The Bill takes the first step in putting in place a single standard rate tax band so that taxpayers will be taxed on what they earn as individuals rather than on their marital status as is the case now, it doubles a series of personal allowances for the aged, widowed, dependent relatives, blind, incapacitated children and it converts them into tax credits at the standard rate of tax and makes them of equal value to all taxpayers. The Bill reforms mortgage interest relief to make it more simple and of greater value to nearly 300,000 taxpayers, it increases rent relief by 50% for those under the age of 55 and in the case of those aged 55 and over doubles the relief for those 80% of claimants on the standard rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On capital acquisitions taxes, I took the major steps of exempting the shared family home from CAT for all those sharing the home, irrespective <Col N="1292" /> of the circumstances of the family relationship, cutting the CAT rate to 20% and simplifying it from a three band structure of 20%, 30% and 40%, and increasing the thresholds for payment of CAT by substantial amounts so that no tax will be payable on gifts or inheritances below £300,000 which are taken from a parent. These substantial tax reductions will not be lost sight of by the electorate when the appropriate time comes.</P>
    <P>When I announced the publication of the Bill on 10 February I summarised its main themes as follows &ndash; the implementation of budget measures, the introduction of new tax reliefs, the enactment of the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT recommendations, a streamlining of tax administration and the setting of the tax agenda for the new millennium. Against that background I wish to elaborate on the contents of the Bill in a number of specific areas. I do not propose to go into particular detail &ndash; the time to do that is on Committee Stage. I will be anxious, however, to listen throughout to contributions from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 12, inclusive, set out the main personal tax changes announced in the budget. The main provisions are the reduction in tax rates, the increase in the standard rate income tax band in section 3, the increase in the main personal allowances in sections 4 and 5, the doubling and standard rating of various personal allowances in sections 6 to 11 and the introduction of the £3,000 home carer's tax allowance in section 12. The changes being made in these sections complete one major tax reform which the Government introduced last year, that is, the move to tax credits by standard rating basic personal allowances, and introduce a further major reform, the move towards establishing a single standard rate band for each individual taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Change and reform often invite controversy. This was the case with the standard rate tax band proposals. Much has been said and written about this proposal, for and against. The Government is convinced that the reform of the tax band is the way we must proceed to meet the changing conditions in society in terms of the new labour market situation and the reality of the position in many households where both spouses are earning income. The social partners have recently endorsed this policy in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The proposal has opened up a wider debate on family issues, the role of earning and non-earning spouses and the view one has of equitable treatment of different household types. From a technocratic point of view there is no correct or right answer in debating such issues &ndash; it is a matter of society choosing the path it wishes to follow. Ultimately, in a democratic society, this boils down to electoral choice. Opinions are divided but the recent opinion polls indicate a far greater support for the proposed changes than one might have deduced from the concerns expressed in the immediate post-budget period. Time will tell, but <Col N="1293" /> budget 2000 will be seen as a defining point in the evolution of tax policy in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 12 gives effect to the £3,000 carer's allowance announced by the Government on 8 December for spouses caring for children, the incapacitated and the aged. The section spells out how the allowance will apply. To ensure it works as smoothly as possible it is proposed to allow for an income disregard when the caring spouse has a limited amount of income of their own, for example, through part-time work. It is also proposed that the allowance will be available where an aged or incapacitated relative resides in the caring spouse's home or is being cared for close by. The allowance can also be retained for one year after the spouse returns to full-time employment. This, and the tapered withdrawal of the allowance when the spouse's income exceeds the income disregard, is designed to ensure it is not suddenly lost when the family circumstances change. We can deal with the operational aspects of the allowance in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 17 set out the changes to standard rated mortgage interest and rent relief announced in the budget. Discussions will shortly commence between the Revenue Commissioners and mortgage providers on the introduction of mortgage interest relief deducted at source from April 2001. Similar discussions will be held with the providers of medical insurance in relation to the deduction of tax relief at source from insurance premia. Both these changes will deliver benefits to the taxpayer. They will also reduce the need for a considerable volume of individual contacts by taxpayers which takes place with Revenue offices at present. These arise from claiming, reviewing and adjusting relief and the issue of revised tax free allowances as appropriate. The new system will streamline the position for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The major changes under way in the personal tax system, the exceptional growth in the numbers of persons in employment and the major initiatives being made by Revenue to upgrade computer systems and improve service to customers have placed a considerable strain on resources. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness envisages examination of the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems, including the possibility of the payment of family income supplement through the tax system. All these factors oblige us to seek simpler and more effective ways to deliver tax relief, such as deduction at source. I am confident that such a system can be successfully put in place with the co-operation of the mortgage and medical insurance sectors.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with benefit in kind on preferential loans and the changes to the reference rate of interest for calculating benefit in kind in respect of home loans.</P>
    <P>Section 16 continues the special exemption from taxation of the unemployment benefit paid to certain systematic short-time workers. This <Col N="1294" /> relief was first introduced in 1994 and, despite current labour market conditions, there are more than 3,000 workers on short-time arrangements for whom the relief continues to be relevant.</P>
    <P>Section 18 enhances the tax relief available for agreed pay restructuring, where such restructuring is necessary to safeguard the future of the firm. The relief, introduced in 1997, is being extended to 2003.</P>
    <P>Section 19 restores the application of the tax-relieved seed capital scheme to new traders on the financial futures exchange in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Section 21 extends tax relief at the standard rate for post-graduate fees under certain conditions. The relief can be claimed by the person concerned or by his or her parents, guardians or spouse where they pay the fees. This new relief, which will apply at the standard rate of tax, will be available to full-time and part-time post-graduate students and will include distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>Approved courses must be at least of one year's duration and cannot exceed four years and they must lead to a post-graduate award based on either a thesis or an examination. Persons taking the courses must already have a primary degree or an equivalent qualification. Private colleges in the State and the post-graduate courses offered by them will be approved by the Minster for Education and Science and the level of post-graduate fees qualifying for tax relief will be determined by that Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 23 amends and extends a number of the important pension fund changes which I introduced with widespread support last year. This gave certain pensioners the option of investing in a continuing fund instead of being forced to convert to an annuity in all cases. This year section 23 extends the new pension options to proprietary directors who control more than 5% of the shares in their company &ndash; the previous ownership requirement was 20% of share capital; allows certain individuals whose pension date has passed but who have not yet invested in an annuity to use the new pension options instead; extends the new arrangements to those using additional voluntary contributions to build up their pension rights; applies gross roll-up tax provisions to the approved retirement funds and approved minimum retirement funds, whereby tax is paid only on payments from the fund; applies PAYE to payments out of an approved retirement fund or approved minimum retirement fund where an individual opts to draw down all or part of the fund; irons out some anomalies in the tax treatment of children who inherit moneys in an approved retirement fund or approved minimum retirement fund; and ensures that all qualifying pension fund managers will be subject to regulation by an independent regulatory agency in the State or in another EU member state. I am sure that these proposed changes will <Col N="1295" /> have the support of both Houses when they come to be discussed in detail.</P>
    <P>In this income tax part of the Bill, section 25 ensures that where, under joint assessment, the non-assessed spouse is proceeded against for non-payment of tax in respect of his or her income, this power can be exercised at a delegated level within Revenue or by the Criminal Assets Bureau, where relevant. The section will also make it clear that the power applies to cases where either spouse is the assessable person. The current provision, dating from 1958, refers to the husband only as the assessable spouse.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 to 29, which form chapter 3 of Part 1 of the Bill, deal with changes to the system of dividend withholding tax which was introduced with effect from 6 April 1999. Last year's Finance Act applied the withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax on dividends paid by Irish companies to certain shareholders. Provision was made to exempt dividends paid to other Irish resident companies, pension funds, charities, collective investment funds and trustees of approved profit sharing schemes and ESOTs. Dividends were also exempt if they were paid to an individual tax resident in the EU or in a tax treaty country, or to a company controlled by such individuals. The legislation set up a detailed administrative system to ensure deduction of the correct amount of tax and to ensure as far as possible that those exempt from the tax were entitled to exemption, for example, on the basis of non-residence.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have examined how the system has worked in its first year of operation. They have consulted market operators, Irish company registrars, stockbrokers and custodian banks, both here and overseas. As a result, this year's Finance Bill will modify the system to reduce administrative costs, simplify certification procedures, remove unnecessary requirements and extend the range of exemptions from withholding tax to companies resident in tax treaty countries but which are not controlled by Irish residents. The changes will be welcomed by business.</P>
    <P>There have been calls for a repeal of the tax. This is not feasible for two main reasons. First, the application of a withholding tax is an effective collection mechanism &ndash; the yield from dividend withholding tax in 1999-2000 is expected to be £50 million. Second, from an international perspective, affording exemption only to those non-Irish residents who are resident in tax treaty countries is consistent with the logic underlying tax treaties and serves to reassure our international colleagues of the integrity of the tax system.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides an exemption from a possible income tax charge on companies resident in another EU treaty country which receive interest from an Irish resident company. This exemption applies where the interest is paid in the course of such companies' trading operations.</P>
    <P>Section 31 raises from £16,000 to £16,500 the <Col N="1296" /> capital value threshold used to determine the capital allowances and the deduction for running expenses for tax purposes for cars used in the course of a trade, profession or employment.</P>
    <P>Section 32 relates to the scheme of capital allowances for expenditure on private convalescent facilities and proposes to treat a convalescent home as if it were a nursing home within the meaning of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. This will obviate the need for the special regulation of this area under the tax code.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 to 40 deal with changes to the relief for urban renewal, rural renewal, the Custom House docks, multi-storey and other car parks, regional airports and certain offshore islands. Section 33 brings forward the termination date for the signing of leases for double rent relief in the Temple Bar area from 5 April 2001 to 31 December 1999, to comply with EU rulings.</P>
    <P>Section 36 extends the capital allowance regime for regional airports to 31 December 2000 where 50% of the expenditure on the project had been incurred by the end of 1999. The section also extends capital allowances for multi-storey car parks outside Dublin to end 2002.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides that a person can qualify for tax relief for construction and development on certain designated islands up to 31 December 1999, where 15% of the total cost of the project was incurred by 30 June 1999, instead of 50% of the cost as currently required.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the EU Commission decided on 22 December last to close the legal proceedings initiated by it in respect of the availability of the double rent and rates reliefs in the Custom House docks area. This decision means that these two reliefs, which are available for a ten year period, will continue to their original end dates where, either the construction of the building was completed before 1 April 1998 or the construction of the building commenced before 1 April 1998 and the tenant occupation of the completed building commenced before 9 February 1999. In all other cases the two reliefs must terminate on 31 December 2003.</P>
    <P>The detailed legal text of the Commission ruling is due shortly and the necessary legislative provisions to implement the EU decision regarding the double rent relief will be put down on Committee Stage. Capital allowances for the buildings in the 27 acre and 12 acre sites in the area were approved by the Commission in January 1999 and these allowances are unaffected by the Commission's decision on double rent and rates relief.</P>
    <P>These proceedings bear testimony to the close attention the Commission is paying, under State aids rules, to new and existing schemes of tax reliefs under Irish tax law which are made available to business investors. We are now routinely notifying all such new schemes to the Commission. The Commission has shown itself active in pursuing complaints made to it about such reliefs. This may not be welcome news to us but it is a reality which we cannot ignore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The Commission has set its face against double rent relief and rates relief which it regards as operating aid to business. The State aid rules do not affect tax relief on residential schemes. However, we ourselves must continue to examine carefully whether all such reliefs are needed on a general basis during an ongoing property boom.</P>
    <P>Section 35 makes a number of changes in the general application of capital allowances including their application to the various tax relief schemes described earlier. Section 35 provides a legal basis for the option to set excess allowances arising in charging rental income against non-rental income. This option was operated administratively by Revenue up to now. It allows a person on joint assessment to set excess capital allowances against the income of a spouse where the individuals own income is insufficient. The section ensures that capital allowances for expenditure on fixtures and fittings in rented residential accommodation and for expenditure on registered holiday homes can be set off only against rental income and not against other non-rental income.</P>
    <P>Sections 38 and 39 extend the qualifying periods for the urban and rural renewal schemes until 31 December 2002 and increase the capital allowances in respect of qualifying commercial buildings to 100%. The year one allowance of 50% will apply to both owner occupiers and lessors of qualifying industrial and commercial buildings with the remaining 50% written off at 4% per annum. The legislative provisions for the business tax incentives available under both schemes are being amended with effect from 1 July 1999 to comply with the EU Commission's approval of both schemes. Double rent and rates relief will not apply to such schemes as a result of the EU Commission ruling.</P>
    <P>Section 41 continues tax relief for film investments for a further five years to 2005. Section 42 requires that to qualify for tax relief on expenditure on significant buildings and gardens in the future, the property must be open to the public on at least ten weekend days out of the 40 opening days required during the high season. Section 125 makes a corresponding change in the rules for CAT relief on a stately house or garden.</P>
    <P>Section 43 makes a number of changes relating to relief for gifts to third level institutions. The current legislation allows tax relief at the marginal rate of income tax on donations of at least £1,000 made to certain third level educational institutions in respect of specific projects approved by the Minister for Education and Science in the areas of research, the acquisition of capital equipment, infrastructural development and the provision of facilities in certain areas of skills shortages.</P>
    <P>Section 43 allows instead for each third level institution to set up an approved development fund to which the donations can be made in respect of the areas specified above. The objectives and operation of the fund will have to be approved in accordance with guidelines to be laid <Col N="1298" /> down by the Minister for Education and Science with the approval of the Minister for Finance. In addition, the range of projects covered by the section may be widened with the approval of both Ministers. Section 43 provides for a reduction in the minimum level of contribution from £1,000 to £250 per annum and the carry-forward of unused tax relief by donors in any one year for a period of three years in total.</P>
    <P>There is also a requirement for the value of tax relief to be recouped from the third level body if any money in the approved fund has not been used for designated investments. The section provides further for delegation by the Minister for Education and Science of his functions under the section to the Higher Education Authority. Private donations will play a much greater role in the funding of education in the future and I responded positively to the proposals put forward by the universities which are reflected in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 44 makes a number of limited changes to the tax relieved save as you earn share options schemes I introduced last year. On Committee Stage I will bring forward a number of proposed changes to ESOT legislation and to certain aspects of the taxation of share options. Section 45 applies the tax rate of 20% announced in the budget to profits from the sale of residential land.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 to 49 as well as sections 51 and 59 give effect to the new arrangements announced in the budget regarding the taxation of life assurance and collective investment funds. The purpose of this is to align the domestic market and IFSC tax treatment of these products and to enable the industry to retain its competitive advantage in the provision of such products within the EU. Effectively, this is a break from the traditional UK method of taxing these funds and a move to the system prevalent in the other member states.</P>
    <P>The changes, which were discussed with the industry, mean the proceeds of these investment media will no longer be taxed on an annual basis but will be subject to an exit tax on encashment or maturity. The exit tax will be the standard rate of income tax plus 3%. This method of taxation is referred to as &ldquo;gross roll-up&rdquo; as the investment returns are allowed roll up gross each year and are taxed on withdrawal, except in the case of non-residents. This is the tax regime which currently applies in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>The new gross roll-up arrangements will come into effect from 1 April 2000 for new domestic funds and from 1 January 2001 for new domestic life assurance business. The current taxation arrangements of taxation in the fund on an annual basis will continue for existing business at the request of the industry. Existing business will eventually run-off, leaving in time only the new system applying to life assurance and collective funds.</P>
    <P>Section 50 of the Bill increases the tax relief on capital allowances for farm pollution control. This relief will be amended on Committee Stage aris<Col N="1299" /> ing from the farm taxation undertakings in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness concluded earlier this month.</P>
    <P>Section 52 provides for accelerated capital allowances for expenditures on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises that meet the required standards as set out in the Child Care Act. This accelerated allowance is available to both owners of the child care facilities and to investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements. I am convinced that the availability of these allowances is an attractive incentive. It will assist in increasing the supply of child care places to help ease the current shortage.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in chapter 4 of Part I are largely technical. Section 56, however, implements a number of substantive changes to the DIRT audit regime. This provides for Revenue to be able to appoint, at its discretion, specially qualified persons to conduct or assist with DIRT audits, to report to the Public Accounts Committee on the results of the DIRT &ldquo;look-back&rdquo; audit currently under way and to publish the results of this audit.</P>
    <P>The section also augments the powers of the Revenue to obtain information in the course of a DIRT audit and applies the audit powers to returns made by life assurers and collective funds under the new gross roll-up tax regime just described. Certain features of this gross roll-up regime involve distinguishing between the tax treatment of investors on the basis of residence or non-residence in the State. Hence the need for these powers in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 60 to 67 in chapter 5 of Part I cover corporation tax changes. These deal largely with the application of the 12.5% rate of tax to trading income which does not exceed £50,000 and technical changes to consortium loss relief and to IRNR provisions. Section 66, together with section 30, is designed to facilitate the growth in securitisation of assets business both within the IFSC and in the Irish financial sector in general. Section 67 makes a number of changes to the grant and revocation of taxation certificates to IFSC or Shannon companies and the repeal of provisions allowing the application of special tax rates to particular IFSC or Shannon trading operations.</P>
    <P>Sections 68 and 71 deal with capital gains tax, enhancing certain aspects of CGT retirement relief for over 55s; applying 20% CGT rate to gains on the disposal of non-resident development land; providing for a more efficient and streamlined tax clearance procedure on sales of newly constructed houses and removing certain tax obstacles impacting on the disposition of property following a foreign divorce or legal separation which is recognised in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 72, which forms a chapter in the Finance Bill, sets out the provisions in relation to the income and corporation tax reliefs for the <Col N="1300" /> renewal and improvement of certain towns whose population is between 500 and 6,000.</P>
    <P>As the House will know, the relevant selection process to designate these towns in each county is still under way. This process involves county councils recommending areas where tax incentives are to be applied to an expert advisory panel which, in turn, will make recommendations to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I will then designate those areas for tax relief which are recommended to me by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>This town renewal scheme involves a similar range of reliefs being available as in the case of the current urban renewal scheme. The scheme will operate from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2003 subject to EU approval of the business elements of the reliefs. The residential reliefs will, however, apply from 1 April next.</P>
    <P>The scheme is intended to assist in restoring or improving the built fabric of towns, promoting sensitive local development and revitalising the centres of small towns. I remember last year on the Finance Bill we had a very good debate and analysis by the Opposition spokesperson on the plight of rural areas and the implications of changing lifestyles and technology for the future of small towns and villages. I share these concerns and look forward to some thoughtful interchanges on this issue in the course of the debates.</P>
    <P>Parts II and III deal with indirect taxation. Sections 75 and 87 relate to excise duties and sections 88 and 105 to value added tax. The excise duty changes: confirm the budget day increase in tobacco excise duty, the reduction in excise duty on kerosene and the abolition of the travel tax on overseas travel by air or sea; provide that the excise duty rebate for diesel fuel used in buses and trains will be confined to the use of low sulphur diesel; clarify the application of excise duty exemptions and reduced rates for fuel used in private flying, buses and off-road vehicles; legislate for updated collection procedures in the case of certain court issued licences and apply excise duty and tax clearance requirements to liquor licences issued to the national cultural institutions; provide for the delegation to authorised staff in Revenue of certain decisions in relation to the operation of vehicle registration tax and for the issue of a combined vehicle registration document covering both registration and subsequent licensing and, finally, close a number of loopholes in relation to the use of mineral oils for automotive purposes.</P>
    <P>The VAT changes are largely technical, apart from sections 92 and 94 which confirm the increase in the farmer's flat rate of VAT from 4% to 4.2%, as announced in the budget. The various other VAT provisions close a loophole in reclaiming VAT on rented holiday accommodation; ensure that VAT estimates and assessments can be raised where annual VAT returns are not made or an under payment is revealed by a VAT audit; implement certain requirements of the EU directive on VAT on investment gold; <Col N="1301" /> confirm in substantive form the new duty free VAT rules consequent on the elimination of duty free on intra-Community travel from 1 July last and clarify the application of certain VAT definitions, exemptions and zero-rating in the case of particular goods and services.</P>
    <P>Part IV sets out a number of stamp duty changes. These are mainly technical except for the changes in section 107 which continues the relief from stamp duty on transfers of assets to young trained farmers for a further three years. The relief, which is a two thirds abatement of the relevant duty will be increased to a full relief on Committee Stage arising from the recent national programme discussions.</P>
    <P>Part V refers to residential property tax. While RPT was abolished from 5 April 1997, arrears of tax continue to be collected, some £1.5 million or more each year. Section 113 provides for an increase in the market value exemption limit to £300,000 from £200,000 in respect of properties which must be tax cleared when they are sold if they exceed this limit. Section 114 absolves from tax clearance any property which the vendor purchased after 5 April 1996, the last valuation date on which RPT was payable. These changes will reduce the administrative burden of tax clearance while still collecting significant arrears of tax from those who should have paid when RPT was in force.</P>
    <P>Sections 115 to 131 give effect to a number of major changes in the CAT code as announced by me in the budget. In addition, there are some further changes I am making to the operation of business and agricultural relief. The result of these changes overall will be to reduce the severe impact of CAT on family inheritances, in particular, make business and agricultural relief more available and move the basis of gift and inheritance tax from domicile to residence, which is the more general basis of liability in the tax system both here and abroad. These are among the most radical and extensive changes to CAT since its introduction.</P>
    <P>Sections 116, 117 and 118 propose to change the basis on which gift tax and inheritance tax is charged on assets situated outside the State from domicile to residence. Under existing tax rules a liability to gift or inheritance tax can arise where either the disponer is domiciled in the State or the property comprised in a gift or inheritance is situated in the State, regardless of the domicile or residence of the disponer. There is no change in this latter property rule.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill changes the general domicile rule to a residence basis so that a liability to gift or inheritance tax can arise on foreign property where either the disponer or beneficiary is resident or ordinarily resident in the State. A person will not be treated as resident or ordinarily resident in the State for this purpose unless he has been resident in the State for the five consecutive tax years before the gift or inheritance. This five year period starts to run from 1 December 1999 <Col N="1302" /> so that a foreign domiciled person in the State will not be affected by this change until 2004.</P>
    <P>The changes apply to gifts or inheritances taken on or after 1 December 1999, except in the case of a gift or inheritance taken under a trust or settlement existing on that date where the present rules will continue to apply. Gifts or inheritances taken prior to 1 December 1999 are unaffected by these changes.</P>
    <P>Section 119 closes off a loophole in the qualification rules for agricultural relief while section 127 allows a person to qualify for CAT business relief in respect of a farming business which does not qualify for agricultural relief in the case of inheritances taken on or after 10 February 2000, the date the Bill was published. The effect will be to allow a beneficiary who fails to qualify, under the 80% assets test for farming &ndash; for example, because they own a domestic property the value of which has increased considerably in recent years &ndash; to seek business relief where he comes within the terms of that relief. The farming groups sought changes along these lines before the budget.</P>
    <P>Section 124 provides for the increases in CAT thresholds in the budget and the introduction of the uniform 20% rate of tax for both gifts and inheritances. It also provides for the aggregation of prior gifts and inheritances only within classes of relationship instead of across classes as at the moment. The current aggregation rules, apart from being very difficult to understand, can lead to unforeseen tax consequences depending on the sequence in which gifts or inheritances occur.</P>
    <P>Section 126 increases the threshold for exemption from probate tax to £40,000, as announced in the budget. Sections 127 and 129 remove certain obstacles to the recognition of foreign divorce orders in the CAT and probate tax code. This mirrors the changes made in the Bill in respect of CGT and stamp duty in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 130 provides for the new relief of CAT on the family home, as promised in the budget. This relief will be supported by the House and responds to a growing concern on the part of many home sharers over the tax consequences of the death of a partner or family member. I have received a large volume of representation on this issue in the past year alone as, I am sure, have the Deputies opposite.</P>
    <P>The final Part of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous, but nonetheless important, tax measures. Section 135 provides for further payments in 2000 of moneys from the Exchequer into the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities. Deputies will be aware of the Government's decision to partially pre-fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities with annual provisions of 1% of GNP and an allocation from the Telecom sale proceeds. Interim legislation was passed before Christmas setting up a temporary holding fund for pension allocations and a sum of £3,015 million was paid into the fund before the year end.</P>
    <P>Section 135 will enable me to make further <Col N="1303" /> payments of up to £1,850 million into the fund this year. This is slightly above the estimate included in the recent budget due, in part, to higher than expected additional receipts from the Telecom sale. The payments into the temporary fund, which is being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, are being made pending the introduction of an appropriate statutory framework for the financing, management and investment of State pension funds on a long-term basis. My Department is currently working on the detailed legislation for this and I hope to be able to introduce it within the next few months. The legislation will also provide for the transfer of the moneys in the temporary fund to the new pension funds once these are established.</P>
    <P>Section 137 deals with donations of heritage items. This provision was introduced in 1995 and allows for the value of certain donations of heritage items to a national heritage institution to be written off against certain tax liabilities of the donor. Each donation must be worth at least £75,000 and be approved by a special selection committee. There is a limit since 1996 of £750,000 on the total amount of gifts which can be tax relieved each year in this way. In response to requests from the Minister for Arts, Culture, Heritage and the Islands, the Bill increases this limit to £3 million. This relief has been used quite actively since it was brought in and has served a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 138 provides for certain changes to the legal requirements for the publication of certain details of tax defaulters. Since 1983, the Revenue Commissioners have been required to compile and publish a list of persons on whom either a fine or other penalty has been imposed by the courts or in whose case the Commissioners have accepted a settlement offer in lieu of initiating legal proceedings. Publication is prohibited in certain cases &ndash; where the settlement is the result of a voluntary disclosure, where the 1993 tax amnesty applies, or where the settlement amount does not exceed £10,000.</P>
    <P>The list of names of tax defaulters is published on a quarterly basis and gives details of the name, address and occupation of the person concerned and the fine or penalty imposed by the courts or the amount of the tax settlement involved. Section 138 contains a number of changes to tighten up these requirements to ensure that details of settlements are published by Revenue, irrespective of whether a fine or penalty has been imposed by a court and irrespective of whether any such fine has already been published by the Revenue Commissioners. The existing law has been interpreted as allowing publication of either the outcome of the court action or the settlement, but not both.</P>
    <P>The section also makes it clear that in future settlements, details will be published even if the relevant tax penalties have been paid in full. This closes a gap in the existing law under which settlements are not published if the full penalty is paid. <Col N="1304" /> Furthermore, the published list will now give a brief description of the circumstances relating to the default or evasion, for example, where a case may have arisen out of a specific inquiry or investigation. All these changes take effect for settlements agreed or court fines imposed after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 140 incorporates a number of provisions to facilitate the introduction of consolidated billing by Revenue &ndash; the issue of a statement showing a taxpayer's payment or repayment position across a number of tax heads. The section provides that claims for repayment can be set off against outstanding tax liabilities. The Revenue Commissioners are empowered to make regulations specifying the order or sequence in which repayments may be set against tax liabilities. A similar enabling provision will allow for appropriation of a tax payment in a particular order where no specific instructions have been given to Revenue.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness highlights the fact that the taxpayer must have confidence in the fairness of the tax system and that this must be maintained by determined action to combat tax evasion and fraud. I acted swiftly last year to arm the Revenue with a wide range of modern powers to combat tax evasion. I also made it clear that in the case of the DIRT issue, the Revenue would pursue the tax, interest and penalties due to the State under the law. I made the point when publishing the Bill that the amounts of money involved in this could be very substantial. I also pointed out that there were constitutional limits on what could be done in respect of a number of the Public Accounts Committee tax recommendations.</P>
    <P>There is no lack of will on this side of the House to see that tax liabilities are properly pursued and to build on the efficiency gains in tax collection which the Revenue Commissioners have achieved over the past 15 years. I have complimented the Revenue on more than one occasion on its achievements in transforming the tax collection system and in upgrading its standard of service all round. I know that it is the Revenue Commissioners' firm intention to continue the process of improvement.</P>
    <P>I hope the House has benefited from the extensive outline I gave of the provisions in the Bill. The Bill is a substantial Bill in terms of content and size. I look forward to the debate on its passage and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" />&ldquo;in view of:</P>
    <P>&ndash;the absence of a clear economic policy underpinning the Finance Bill,</P>
    <P>&ndash;he continual changing of expenditure targets by the Government,</P>
    <P>&ndash;the threat to competitiveness caused by inflation,</P>
    <P>&ndash;the inadequacy of income tax relief for the lower paid,</P>
    <P>&ndash;the contradictions in labour force policy in the tax proposals which apply to spouses,</P>
    <P>&ndash;the absence of fair and practicable proposals on child care, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;the refusal by the Minister for Finance to introduce a fair and equitable tax regime for credit unions,</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Act which implements it are the main instruments of economic policy at present in the hands of the Minister for Finance. Now that interest rate policy and exchange rate policy are matters for the European Central Bank, fiscal policy in its widest sense is the only real instrument of policy available to an Irish Government seeking to influence the course of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is the Government's pilot. He steers the ship of State through straits and narrows, avoids reefs and rocks to bring the ship safely to port. In all this his primary navigation instrument is the budget and the Finance Bill which flows from it. Any Minister for Finance must ask himself or herself a number of very simple questions? Should he or she spend more or less money? Should he or she increase or decrease taxes? Should he or she reduce some taxes and raise others? What will be the effect on the country if he or she uses the budget to influence employers and unions in negotiating a wage agreement? By how much should he or she increase social welfare expenditure and all the payments, allowances, benefits and pensions that are part of the social welfare code? These are the questions which must be in the Minister's head as he drafts the budget, and the economic consequences of his decisions must take precedence over all other considerations.</P>
    <P>There is another approach to budget making, where the Minister of the day sees himself as a Santa Clause figure, a dispenser of gifts, a popular fellow who arrives once a year and who in jovial mood distributes largesse. When this approach is taken, as it has been taken in the past, the purpose of the budget is political rather than economic, and the questions which decide the Minister's actions are different from those stated above. These question include, how can he or she be popular? Which interest group will he or she favour so that his or her party will be better posi<Col N="1306" /> tioned to win the next election? How can he or she further advance his or her career?</P>
    <P>Ministers in the past who have afforded primacy to political considerations have brought in bad budgets. Ministers who afford primacy to economic considerations sometimes get it wrong, but at least they get it wrong while doing the right thing. This budget and Finance Bill have been based on mixed objectives, some political, some economic and some downright eccentric. The recipe has a variety of ingredients, but the outcome is more dog's dinner that <i>haute cuisine</i>.</P>
    <P>That is a great pity. No Minister for Finance has ever had the opportunity which this Minister has had, but unfortunately he has not availed of it. Rather than making further progress in our advance as a country, this budget leaves the ship of State becalmed. There is no clear course plotted and doubts are beginning to fill the public mind as to whether our prosperity is being put at risk, will the wage agreement hold, is our economy overheating, and does the Minister know what he is doing?</P>
    <P>The Minister's ineptitude on budget day, his numerous U-turns since then, the contradictions between the policy statement on budget day and the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness have caused widespread unease and for the first time in five years I sense the commencement of a dangerous trend. Confidence is beginning to seep out of the economy.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the budget was a political fiasco. I have no intention of labouring that point further. The Minister's failure has become the raw material for every comedian in the country. I will, however, discuss a more serious issue &ndash;  the growing realisation that the budget is also an economic fiasco.</P>
    <P>A Government, before introducing a budget, must take a view on how much public expenditure may be prudently increased or decreased. There is always a presumption in the House that this has been done and that this decision is the foundation stone on which budgets are built. What can we say about a Government which, one week after announcing its projected expenditure targets for the year, makes further announcements which commit it to over £0.5 billion pounds of further expenditure, and which, in the Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill, published some weeks after the budget, seeks to legislate increases in expenditure in excess of £300 million?</P>
    <P>There is a view that the Minister has so much money at his disposal that it really does not matter whether or not he changes his expenditure plans. There is truth in this if he is disposed to spend a little extra, but when the variation between the Government's stated policy and the actual outcome in the Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill is so dramatic that we are talking about several hundred million pounds, is it any wonder that the public are confused about where the Government stands on fundamental economic issues?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> This Minister built a reputation on his supposed ability to control public expenditure. His 4% formula has, like a conjurer's trick, disguised what has actually happened. The outturns for 1998 and 1999, have shown that current public expenditure has increased by over 20%, not 8% which, on the face of it, was the import of the Government's commitment to controlling expenditure when it took office. In the past two months, however, farce has been turned into a high art form by the manner in which announcements made on a weekly basis dramatically alter the fundamental arithmetic of the budget.</P>
    <P>A Government that does not have a strong policy on public expenditure cannot manage the economy. This Minister, whose constant and only mantra from the Opposition benches was that the rainbow Government was spending too much and that he would batten down the hatches, should now consider his position.</P>
    <P>Expansionary budgets are inflationary. Inflation makes people poorer. Inflation, in particular wage inflation, also undermines a country's competitiveness and if present trends continue the competitive edge which gave us the Celtic tiger and the economic advantages we enjoy, will erode very quickly. There is no doubt but that the rate of inflation influences the level of wages that workers and their representatives are prepared to accept. The Minister' s ineptitude in not giving adequate tax relief to low-paid workers and in increasing the consumer price index by almost 1% by increasing the excise on 20 cigarettes by 50p has resulted in a higher nominal wage increase than one would have expected. It has also resulted in the Tánaiste abandoning the £4.40 per hour rate for the minimum wage before it has even been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister will wrap the mantle of the health services around him in defending the excise increase on cigarettes. I agree with the increase and I said so in my reply to the Budget Statement. I agree with the thinking on health care which gave rise to it. However, the Minister should have made compensating reductions in excise to ensure that the adverse effect on the consumer price index was cancelled. If the Minister had reduced the price of petrol and diesel by an amount which would cancel the CPI increase caused by the increase in excise on cigarettes, he would have got a double bang for his buck, his inflation figure would be almost 1% lower, and he would have reduced the cost of transport at a time when the actions of OPEC are beginning to bite.</P>
    <P>I see no reason that the Minister could not have taken this course of action. He did not put 50p on cigarettes because he needed the revenue to fund a particular spending programme. He put it on as a health measure, to reduce the incidence of smoking. He has pledged that the proceeds will be used in the fight against cardio vascular disease and cancer. We agree with that. However, in positioning the Government to negotiate a <Col N="1308" /> national wage agreement, he should have reduced excise elsewhere, on petrol, on fossil fuels, so that the CPI would not have gone to double the European average where it now stands at a point when a new wage agreement is being put to workers for acceptance.</P>
    <P>We no longer have a closed economy, and the traditional causes of inflation, for example too much money chasing too few goods and services, no longer apply. Consumer demands can now be satisfied by the productive capacity of our 11 colleagues in the European Union and of the wider world, who are only too anxious to sell us their goods. An analysis of the consumer price index based on the fact that there is no rise in the prices of many imported goods because we are an open economy is to avoid the real issue. That is not where the problem lies and is not where the problem will arise in the future. As yet there is no sign of difficulty with the balance of payments arising from the sucking in of imports to satisfy consumer demand. However, there is inflation in the economy, even though it is not measured in the consumer price index. We see inflation in the continuing rise in house prices, in the increased cost of services. Inflation in indigenous service industries is now in excess of 6%, and it is this inflation, the price of servicing a car, the cost of an electrician or a plumber to do a small job in the house, the price of a haircut, the increasing costs in pubs and restaurants, which will drive wages forward. It is not a defence in arguing about inflation to say that a whole variety of consumer goods can be imported into Ireland to satisfy demands. That is not the issue. The issue is the housing market and inflation in indigenous services. This inflation is already impacting on wage demands.</P>
    <P>When people on middle incomes can no longer afford to buy a house in the capital city, national wage agreements are in crisis. When the middle grade civil servant, married to another middle grade civil servant, cannot buy a house in this city, when applications to move down the country when Government Departments move continue to rise, when the nurse married to the garda cannot buy a house in Dublin, when the two teachers married to each other cannot afford a house in Dublin, when we cannot get nurses to serve in Dublin hospitals because they cannot afford to live in Dublin, we have an inflation problem. That point has been arrived at and the evidence is all around us. When the Minister chooses to ignore the evidence in the interview he gave on Sunday on inflation, he is not thinking straight on this issue.</P>
    <P>Before the ink is dry on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, before the issues have been put to the workers of this country, the NBU and SIPTU were on strike, before negotiations on their pay claim had commenced. A strike was avoided last night when CIE put £15 per week on the table. That is a 7% increase on what has been quoted as the basic wage for bus drivers. Does anybody think this 7% increase will be withdrawn <Col N="1309" /> in four weeks? Is it not reasonable to assume that the 7% will simply be the negotiating base from which a higher settlement figure is reached on top of the 5.5% already committed in the PPF?</P>
    <P>I am not saying the bus drivers do not deserve it. I am not saying that there is not a rate for the job that might be necessary to fill the vacancies in Dublin Bus for additional drivers. What I am saying, however, is that a bad budget has led to a wage agreement whose merits are more cosmetic than real. Even before the wage agreement is put to the workers, there is evidence to suggest that it will not survive the 33 months, even though there is no local bargaining element contained within it.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the position taken up by the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland. Historically, that has been the most militant teaching union. It has rejected the pay agreement even though teachers, who would be regarded as early settlers under the PCW, are entitled to an overall increase of between 18% and 19% over 33 months. The ASTI has rejected this wage agreement out of hand. It has stated that it proposed to take industrial action in pursuit of an immediate claim of 30%.</P>
    <P>It is remiss of the Minister to make little of the inflationary threats facing the country, in circumstances where before the new wage agreement has even been put to the workers, two such significant wage demands &ndash; coming from the employees of Dublin Bus and the secondary school teachers &ndash; are put in place.</P>
    <P>Against this background, even though I believe the new wage agreement will be ratified, I believe it will not hold and that there is now a real possibility of wage inflation eroding the competitiveness of the economy. The issue is not price rises<i> per se</i>, because the cost of goods and services are going up. The issue is that the asset inflation in the price of houses and the inflation in the cost of services which are delivered domestically, but not internationally, will cause an explosion in wage demands. Over a period of time this will erode our competitiveness. The Government seems to be unaware of this and is standing back from the problem and doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The public perception now is that the Government is a soft touch. Since the day the Fianna Fáil backbenchers took to the plinth and undermined the Minister's budget, every lobby group in the country knows that the banner of the Government is now the white flag. The Minister will face it hot and heavy every month of this year because he is now reputed to be a soft touch. Every group in the country will take advantage of this, especially when they know that the Minister has a lot of money in very deep pockets. They also know that he can be pressured into doling it out in large amounts when his own backbenchers dance the jig on the plinth of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must take a large proportion of the blame for this state of affairs. The primary policy plank on which the budget should have been built was to exchange tax relief for low <Col N="1310" /> nominal wage increases. By ignoring the legitimate demands for tax relief by the low paid, by fobbing them off with a paltry £10 per week of extra tax credit and by concentrating the bulk of resources available on further relief for the well off, the Minister made the negotiation of a wage agreement very difficult indeed. The possibility of the wage agreement now negotiated surviving intact for three years will be extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>The big failure of the budget was, as everybody now knows, the failure of a Minister with almost unlimited resources to reform the taxation system in a manner which ensured further growth in the economy, in a manner which was fair and equitable and which laid the foundations for a satisfactory wage agreement.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see how the Minister has moved his position in the course of the negotiations with the social partners. In this tax year, people with income in excess of £100 enter the tax net. Next year they will enter it at £110, an increase in allowances or credits of £10 per week. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, however, commits the Minister to exempting from income tax all income up to the level of the minimum wage, that is £200 for a 40 hour week.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael proposed that the minimum wage should be exempt from income tax in our tax document published early last October, the Taoiseach described the proposal as rubbish. It is interesting to note that after the fiasco of a failed budget, the exempting of the minimum wage from income tax is now the central plank of the Government's commitments on tax relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Waterloo on budget day arose from his proposal to individualise the tax bands. Fine Gael has always believed that the income tax code should reflect the additional costs which arise when two spouses are working rather than one. We believe that the PAYE allowance goes a small way in this direction, and in our tax document we proposed that the PAYE allowance should be increased from £1,000 at the standard rate, where it now stands, to £3,600 at the standard rate. We also proposed that it should be extended to cover self-employed people, especially the very large numbers of people who traditionally would have been PAYE workers but who are now employed on a contract basis. That is particularly true in Dublin, both in the financial services industry and the information technology sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to go in a different direction. His proposal penalises families where only one spouse works, and the sad thing about his proposal was that he could have achieved the same policy objectives in terms of increased participation in the labour force if he had approached the problem in the manner that Fine Gael had proposed. He proposed, however, that next year a family where one spouse works will be taxed at the higher rate when their income exceeds £28,000, but a family where two spouses work will not be liable for the higher rate until their income exceeds £34,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> The Minister has maintained this differential in the Finance Bill. It is not this that has upset people so much, but the fact that he intends to increase the differential over the next two budgets so that the two income family does not go on the higher rate until their income exceeds £56,000, but the one income family pays at the top rate after £28,000. That is the nub of the controversy. This proposal is extremely unfair and is designed to increase female participation in the labour force by forcing stay at home wives out to work rather than allowing them a free choice of whether to work.</P>
    <P>The proposal is also unnecessary as the type of tax incentives which result from the Minister's proposal could also be achieved in a fair and equitable way which would not discriminate against single income families. If the Minister had taken on board the other proposals in Fine Gael's tax document, including the proposal to introduce a middle rate of tax at 35%, he would have achieved an even stronger labour force effect and avoided the political fiasco which he faced on budget day.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government has now seen the light and I am glad also that in the PPF its commitment to the individualisation of tax bands has been moderated. As I understand the text of the agreement, it is now proposed that the individualisation as announced in the budget will be introduced in the Finance Bill, but the commitment for the future is that the individual tax bands introduced now would be increased in line with wage increases over the next three budgets rather than by the extraordinary increases proposed on budget day.</P>
    <P>It is as well to recall what the Minister's stated intention was on budget day. In this tax year a single person enters the higher rate once he or she earns more than £14,000. The Minister proposed that this would rise to £17,000 in the next tax year, £23,500 in the tax year after that and £28,000 in the following tax year. Because each individual taxpayer would have an individual band, if there were two spouses working in the family, the figure would be £56,000.</P>
    <P>The increase committed by the Minister in the budget was from £14,000 to £28,000 or £28,000 to £56,000, an increase of at least 100% in simple arithmetic. The commitment arising from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is that the Minister would increase the individual band in line with wages and the commitment on wages is an increase of 15.5% over 33 months.</P>
    <P>This is a major change of policy between the budget position and that announced in the published programme from the social partnership. Under pressure from the general public, the Opposition and Deputies supporting the Government, the Minister was forced into his first U-turn and announced a £3,000 tax allowance for stay at home spouses who are caring for dependent children, elderly parents or an incapacitated adult. This proposal has been further modified in <Col N="1312" /> the Finance Bill and the Minister has finally realised, as I pointed out to him during Question Time before Christmas, that stay at home spouses must be allowed some earnings before the working spouse is disqualified from this allowance. This allowance was announced by a Minister under extreme pressure and was announced for considerations of political expediency rather than for any economic policy reason. The problem, however, is that when Ministers do things which they make up as they go along, they frequently contradict other policy positions they have already taken up. Whatever the merits of the £3,000 stay at home allowance, it will clearly act as a disincentive to women who wish to return to full-time work. If they return to full-time work their spouses will lose the £3,000 allowance and the first £660 of their earnings will be cancelled out by the loss of this allowance. In that it runs counter to the Minister's stated objective on the day of the budget, that there should be an increase in female participation in the workforce and that he was under-individualising the tax bands to achieve this policy objective, he has now introduced a balancing measure that runs in the opposite direction and it is now difficult to believe there will be an increase in participation in the workplace by women.</P>
    <P>The allowance as proposed is anomalous. The spouse of a person who cannot work through illness will not qualify for this allowance, neither will a taxpayer whose spouse is in a nursing home, a person whose spouse is on disability benefit or single persons acting as carers. We all know of cases where a son or daughter &ndash; more typically a daughter &ndash; leaves work to care for a parent who is ill and because it is a daughter rather than a spouse who is in the caring role the working parent cannot avail of this allowance. The Minister has introduced two concepts and given almost equal weight to them. He wants the £3,000 allowance to compensate a woman for staying at home but he has introduced the caring condition also. However, there are carers other than spouses. There are carers in families who have made great sacrifices, who are sons or daughters, though more typically daughters. In circumstances where a father, mother and daughter are involved and a daughter gives up work to care for the mother while the father is still working, why should the father not get the £3,000 allowance? He will not get it because this proposal was made up on the hoof and is riddled with anomalies, despite the work done by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance since the initial announcement. We have all heard the old adage, marry in haste, regret at leisure. The Minister's position is a parody of this &ndash; legislate in haste, regret at leisure.</P>
    <P>There are two serious and significant omissions from this Finance Bill. The Minister has failed once more to bring forward a fair and practicable child care package. When he was under pressure on his tax individualisation proposals his defenders claimed that these proposals were <Col N="1313" /> designed so that working women would have additional money through tax relief to pay for child care. This horse, however, fell at the first fence when it was pointed out that the individualisation proposal does not focus on families with children and that the biggest beneficiaries are couples, both on high salaries, whose children are reared.</P>
    <P>There is a further serious omission in the failure to deal with the taxation of credit unions in a fair and equitable way. I will return to this and other issues on Committee Stage and I look forward to a full debate then. There are many issues I would like to deal with which arise from individual sections of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my budget contribution I said we live in a time of extraordinary social and economic potential. Standards of living have been rising for most people in employment and income per head will reach average EU levels very soon. However, while rejoicing in the good news stories, we must not forget those who are not doing so well or who are not benefiting from the present buoyant economy.</P>
      <P>Successive UN human development reports have highlighted the reality of poverty in Ireland. The 1999 report has again highlighted the fact that among industrialised countries, only the USA has a higher proportion of its population in poverty. There are substantial numbers of people living in poverty in Ireland in both urban and rural areas. The number of long-term unemployed is still problematic and access to appropriate accommodation is becoming harder for larger numbers of people. Adult illiteracy levels remain very high while the drop out rate from second level education is a cause of major concern and is storing up problems for the future. Rural exclusion continues to be a major forgotten issue in Irish society and many communities are excluded from our current prosperity. These issues and those of equality, health care and disability must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Everyone, including the Government, signed up to the recent NESC strategy document, which made a strong case for budgets to give increased priority to social inclusion within public spending and a three-pronged approach of social welfare, mainstream public policy programmes and a special investment package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fine debate we had on last year's Finance Bill. Many rural areas are, however, falling further behind. I welcome the huge investment in the national primary road structure, but that leaves the areas not served by such roads, which are sometimes served by totally underfunded national secondary roads, peripheral and non-competitive. This is a very serious problem, and I speak from first hand experience as I reside in north Kerry. We have a national secondary road that has received £200,000 this year from the NRA, but the area is becoming marginalised because of the lack of infrastructure. Our train service was taken away and our road <Col N="1314" /> infrastructure is disintegrating. Every day it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract industries to Listowel, despite the efforts of all State agencies and the efforts I have made at my own expense.</P>
    <P>This is a major problem and I do not know how the Minister can address it through financial packages, but it must be seriously examined. That is obvious when one leaves Dublin on a Thursday evening for one's rural constituency. The differences in activity between the two places are becoming more glaringly obvious and pronounced.</P>
    <P>The budget ignored the strategies outlined by the NESC. The budget and this Bill simply reward the rich and better off at the expense of the lower paid and poor. Although I acknowledge that the Minister made an extra allocation in the region of £125 million to stay-at-home spouses, I want to outline some basic figures which demonstrate this assertion. The Minister introduced a package of more than £1 billion in taxation measures compared to the £390 million allocated in the social inclusion package. Two and a half times more has been allocated to tax measures than to social inclusion measures. One and a half times more will be spent reducing the top tax rate than will be spent on our children.</P>
    <P>Both the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI have analysed the distributional impact of this budget. The analyses revealed that the richest 10% of households will benefit six times more than the poorest 10% of households. The poorest 10% of households will benefit from a 0.7% increase in incomes whereas the richest 10% will benefit from a 4.2% increase. The middle 20% of households will benefit by an average 2% increase. Those figures may have changed slightly because of the Minister's adjustment in respect of stay-at-home spouses but they show that the budget and the Finance Bill are very much directed at the top echelons of society. That is very unjust.</P>
    <P>I am aware at first hand of a number of companies in peripheral rural areas which cannot afford to pay their employees a decent wage without risking going out of business. People are working for very low wages because they want to work and they want companies to remain in rural towns and villages. The only way in which extra money can be provided to these employees is through the taxation system. The Minister should have addressed the issue of low pay in the budget. I could outline instances in which people are working for very low wages merely to earn the respect which derives from employment. However, in many cases it is not worth their while.</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared to be gaining some understanding of the difficulties of lower paid workers in the previous budget by raising the level of tax-free income from £70 to £100. However, he seems to have slipped back to his old philosophy in this budget, raising the level of tax-free income by a mere £10 to £110 per week. <Col N="1315" /> Fine Gael's proposal that no tax should be paid on incomes up to £170 per week, the equivalent of the pay received for a 39 hour week at the minimum wage rate of £4.40 per hour, is very reasonable. The Minister could have taken money away from the top level of society and targeted it at this very vulnerable sector. The ESRI report estimated that in the region of 163,000 people would substantially gain from the minimum wage provision outlined by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>It seems ludicrous that the Government proposes to tax all income over £110 per week when the minimum wage, due to be introduced in April, will equate to £170. It is clear that the Government does not have any real understanding of the need to redress social exclusion, a belief which is also evidenced by small social welfare increases and the Government's failure to increase personal social welfare payments to £100 per week. Low paid workers were not catered for in the budget and that will affect many industries in rural Ireland which are barely surviving. It will also affect the tourism industry and others in which workers traditionally receive lower pay.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the credit union proposals. The credit union people are becoming increasingly frustrated. It is ironic that the Taoiseach has agreed to meet them next week when the Minister has not met them. The Minister understands tactics very well on the football field. I have often discussed with him tactics and their failure, particularly in regard to his own county in the last all-Ireland final. The Minister did not learn from my good friend Mick O'Dwyer's mistake in that instance. The Minister should have met the representatives of the credit unions and diffused the situation. I believe the Minister probably regrets that he did not meet them although I doubt he would admit that publicly. The Minister's position is somewhat undermined by the fact that the Taoiseach has agreed to meet credit union representatives next week. I would not be at all surprised if the Taoiseach were to accede to their requests, namely, that credit unions would retain their corporation tax exemption; that DIRT on deposits would be applied at a rate of 20%; that the first £375 dividend would be tax free and that the next £375 would be taxed at 20%; and that dividends over £750 would lose any tax free exemption. Those are reasonable requests.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Commission and DG IV. He stated the existing taxation regime in respect of credit unions has triggered a complaint to the Commission and that any legislative initiative taken at this stage could potentially aggravate the position. The complaint to which the Minister referred was made by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, IMSA, which followed a similar complaint from the Irish Bankers Federation which the directorate found to be unwarranted. The Minister may not be aware that DG IV met with the IMSA in December and asked it to submit information which has not yet been submitted in spite of repeated requests. I may be <Col N="1316" /> wrong but I believe that the IMSA will not submit the information and that DG IV will dismiss its complaint in the near future. When the Minister receives that clearance from DG IV, I hope he will not make any more spurious excuses to prevent implementation of the recommendations of the working group which he established. The Minister made a promising start last year as regards profit and gain sharing. However, he does not seem to have continued that in this budget. I have often emphasised the importance of encouraging positive employee involvement by new and imaginative means. I remind the House that Deputy John Bruton, when he was Minister for Finance in 1996, introduced incentives for employees to become involved in profit sharing and shareholding. This was a creative measure for its time and should have led to further development in the area. The Minister for Finance responded positively last year by introducing provisions for save-as-you-earn share ownership schemes. While the practical application of these provisions took some time, they have made extra options available to companies. However, these do not meet the needs of many unquoted companies in the private and public sectors. It was expected that the range of options would be expanded in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A special tax regime for profit sharing, employee shared ownership, gain sharing and related schemes is based on the belief that it is beneficial to encourage the development of pay systems to better reflect performance. These schemes assist the identification of employees with the place where they work. They provide an opportunity for remuneration in relation to performance, thus reducing the impact of overheads and fixed costs on competitiveness. The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a proposal to investigate this area and a commitment to explore ways of encouraging more profit and gain sharing in companies. The Minister should establish a task force to do this. This area will be important.</P>
    <P>Another area about which I am concerned is the film industry. When the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, launched a strategy for the film industry on 15 December, she committed the Government to fully implementing the recommendations of the Kilkenny report. She stated that film will be a central plank in the Government's industrial policy. One of the principal recommendations of the Kilkenny report was that section 481 should be extended for another seven years, with 100% tax relief for films with budgets under £4 million. However, the Finance Bill extends it for five years and maintains the relief at 80%. The uncertainty while the Government dithered for more than 12 months about whether it would renew the incentive and for how long had a negative impact on the industry. Although definite figures are not available yet, it is estimated that there was a 50% reduction in the value of productions last year. I know this from the Kerry Screen Commission <Col N="1317" /> which found it difficult to attract productions to Kerry.</P>
    <P>I will put down an amendment to this Bill on Committee Stage. Perhaps the Minister will consider increasing tax relief under section 481 to 100% for films with budgets under £4 million. If this is not possible, the industry should be compensated in part by raising tax relief from 85% to 87% to allow for the fall in the top rate of tax and the post-production levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 December last the Minister made his Budget Statement and today he presented the Finance Bill to the House. Given all that has happened since 1 December and what we now know of what happened before that, it is astonishing that the Minister is still in office. The past few months have been an abject lesson in the use and abuse of power. The Minister has shamelessly used power in the interests of one class and abused it by brazenly ignoring the few safeguards the State has to prevent Ministers from doing what he did. The Minister has occasionally been hopelessly incompetent and laughably irrelevant. However, the Minister will have the last laugh because this Bill contains all the elements which made the budget so objectionable. Despite all the bleating from Fianna Fáil backbenchers, the Minister will be able to take off to Cheltenham in March with his head held high, safe and sure in the knowledge that he has done the business for the people who matter to him most.</P>
      <P>The budget was unfair, divisive and reckless. Never before has any Minister for Finance sought to redistribute wealth so decisively in favour of the better off. Never before has any Minister for Finance sought to appropriate to one class the benefits which should have accrued to all. I will return to the row about individualisation later but far more important was the deliberate decision of the Minister to dole out the benefits of economic growth to those who need it least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was in a unique position &ndash; there were no hard choices to be made. He could easily have introduced a reasonably fair budget which would have kept everyone happy, as well as laying the foundations for a successor agreement to Partnership 2000. However, the Minister deliberately decided not to do that. He deliberately decided to do the business for the better off. The punters in Cheltenham will have hundreds of pounds extra to spend while social welfare recipients will get little more than the price of a pint &ndash; less when the local authority claws it back in increased rent. One or two examples hammer this point home. A married couple with a combined household income of £50,000 will be better off by £2,444 per annum as a result of the budget. A clerical officer in the Civil Service will be £424 better off regardless of whether he or she is married. Two clerical officers with a joint income of £28,000 will be better off by £684. It is easy to condemn the budget in terms of extremes, which would probably be a mistake. It is not only the poor who have done badly out of the budget. The <Col N="1318" /> vast majority of people, taxpayers and non-taxpayers, have done badly as a result of the choices made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the 1999 budget, the Minister introduced a system of tax credits. This might easily have been forgotten as all the arguments since have been about tax reductions. The advantage of tax credits is that they make it possible to reduce tax in a manifestly fair manner by giving the same cash benefit to all taxpayers. The total cost of the Minister's tax package is about £1,200 million. Last autumn I asked the Department of Finance to cost a reduction in tax across the board of £750 per annum. They told me this would cost £1,163 million. I rejected the figures as too high and in our pre-budget presentation we opted for a lower credit. For the sake of comparison, it is useful to look at what the Minister might have done for roughly the same cost as the package he is now introducing. The package we proposed in November would have taken 251,200 people out of the tax net altogether. It would have taken the great majority of people earning less than the national minimum wage out of the tax net. It would have put an additional £15 per week into the pockets of virtually all taxpayers. Instead the Minister did something totally different. His package will take just 70,000 out of the tax net. Some 200,000 people earning less than £4.40 an hour are still paying income tax. Only a small minority of people are better off than they would have been had the Minister done the right thing. The important point is that some of these people are significantly better off than they might otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>We are constantly told these days that there is no difference between the political parties, that we are all the same. I wish the people who say these things would look at the facts. The difference between these two sets of proposals is clear and stark. Let me repeat the central fact. Some 200,000 people who will pay income tax next year would not do so if we had our way. This is a stark difference by any standards. It is the difference between doing the right thing by the Irish people as a whole and doing the right thing for a small minority, many of whom would happily forego the Minister's largesse. I said earlier that the Minister's package is too expensive, that he gave away too much. I am on record in this House and elsewhere as saying so and I repeat that I believe there is not unlimited scope for reductions in income tax, indeed for reductions in tax generally.</P>
    <P>For years we have tolerated poor public services. Indeed, given the level of resources available we had very little choice. Teachers have taught and children have been taught in classes which were often too big and without the equipment and resources which were routinely available in other countries. Our local authority services are under-funded, our health service is in crisis and our infrastructure is paid for by other people. Now, for the first time, we can change all that because we have the money. The only ques<Col N="1319" /> tion is, do we have the political will to use the money in that way? We have a straightforward choice. We can channel our new-found wealth into more foreign holidays, more meals out and more private consumption or we can use it to improve the services which we all use.</P>
    <P>Two main issues arose out of the tax changes announced on budget day and since modified by the Minister. The first was low pay and the second was individualisation and all that goes with that. Perhaps I should start by saying what I mean by low pay. I mean everyone earning less than the average industrial wage of approximately £17,500. This amounts to approximately 60% of all income earners. I suppose the term &ldquo;low pay&rdquo; is inaccurate and gives a wrong impression in that it suggests we are talking about a minority of people. We are not, we are talking about a majority of people. The budget ignored the needs of average workers. The facts are incontrovertible. One need only flick through the example sheets appended to the Minister's speech to see the effect of the budget day changes. Since then the Minister has engaged in a bit of what he euphemistically refers to as rebalancing. It is worth having a look at what he has done.</P>
    <P>One of the first effects of the budget day changes was to bring about the near collapse of the partnership talks. SIPTU pulled out of the talks and refused to go back until it got a commitment to a better deal for those on low pay. As we now know, the Minister has, in effect, refused to change his tax package. Instead he obliged his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to take some of the hit. The PRSI exemption will be extended to £200 per week provided the individual concerned is earning less than £200 per week. There are two major problems with this. First, it creates a further poverty trap within the system. It has been common cause in this House and elsewhere that we should try to reduce the poverty traps within the system. In fairness, there has been a good deal of progress on the part of all Governments in recent years in this regard. The Minister's proposal deliberately creates a further trap for reasons of pure expediency. Once one exceeds £200 per week, one pays PRSI on all but the first £100 of income. The result is that someone earning just over £200 per week is worse off than someone earning just less than that. Needless to say, I appreciate the motivation behind the proposal, but we should be very slow to create this sort of anomaly. The same argument applies with even greater persuasive force to the levy exemption threshold. In this instance the rap is deeper and the resulting disincentive is greater. The more we increase the threshold, the greater the trap when it becomes payable.</P>
    <P>Of greater importance is the principle involved in exempting people from PRSI as a means of reducing the cumulative burden of income tax and PRSI. For years PRSI was effectively just <Col N="1320" /> another tax and seen as such by many workers. For many years there was no fund simply because the take from PRSI did not cover the social welfare benefits which were paid out of the fund. However, all that has now changed and I believe we must radically reassess our attitude to the PRSI fund. Two years ago the fund was in surplus for the first time. The Estimates published prior to the budget projected a likely surplus of almost £600 million this year. The importance of this development appears to have been lost on many commentators. This means in effect that we can afford to greatly increase the level of benefit or the range of cover without increasing taxes or reducing expenditure elsewhere. For the first time we have an insurance fund worthy of the title. For the first time we have choices in how we plan for the future or how we use resources in the present. However, the Minister is not doing this. He is, in effect, raiding the fund in order to get himself out of a political mess. It would be perfectly fair to reduce the take in PRSI if we were satisfied we have the resources to do what we want to do, but this is not what the Minister has done, it is not the judgment he has made. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has acted out of political expediency in order to save face and bail himself out of a hole which he created for himself.</P>
    <P>The issue of individualisation is important and deserves a good deal of debate and study, perhaps more considered debate and study than it got during December. In a moment I want to look at what the Minister claims he was trying to do, but first I want to say a few words about what he actually did. The end result is that there are now at least four different types of married couples for income tax purposes. There are married couples with two incomes earning more than £28,000 between them. For them individualisation is quite a useful little bonus, particularly if they are earning more than £34,000 in which case they can get the full benefit of the change. Second, there are married couples with two incomes earning less than £28,000 between them. For them the argument is largely academic in that they are not earning enough to benefit from the Minister's proposals. Third, there are married couples with one income, earning less than £28,000 where one partner stays at home to care for children or other relatives. Finally, most of the rest gain from neither proposal. These are mostly married couples with one income and no children. It requires no imagination to see that the changes have introduced a level of complication into the system which is difficult to understand and impossible to justify.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the £3,000 stay at home allowance. This measure is badly thought out. It was hastily introduced to assuage the Fianna Fáil backbenchers. It makes no sense. It will be difficult to police. I will wager any money with the Minister that it will not be on the Statute Book in five years' time. The Minister's own comments are the best possible commentary on the allowance. In a radio <Col N="1321" /> interview a few days after the budget he was asked why he came up with this idea. He said it was intended to rebalance the effect of individualisation. When he was asked why he wanted to rebalance the effect of individualisation he said that he personally did not want to rebalance it but that others did. For good measure, he went on to explain that the £3,000 allowance did not actually rebalance the individualisation anyway. In other words, it was and is a meaningless sop which will never meet its stated aim, not least because the Minister who introduced it did not, and still does not, want it to.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, there is nothing wrong with providing additional support for those who are obliged not to work in order to look after elderly relatives or children, but the Minister has gone the wrong way about it. He should have abolished the means test for the carer's allowance and made additional direct payments towards child care. The stay at home allowance is an absurd hybrid, not least because it acts as a significant disincentive to work for some of the women that individualisation is meant to help.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the extra burden placed on pensioners by the national car test system and the restriction on mobility and independence which this will entail for a great many elderly people, and therefore calls on the Government immediately to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;provide that all testing and re-testing of cars owned by persons aged 65 years or more be carried out without charge;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;provide a subsidy for the acquisition of <Col N="1322" /> a compliant car not over three years old in any case where the cost of ensuring compliance of a car owned by a person over the age of 65 years is greater than £250;</P>
    <P>&ndash;provide that the cost of medical certificates required by drivers aged over 70 be refunded to such drivers by the Department of Health and Children, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;provide that three-year licences issued to persons aged over 70 who are certified as fit to continue driving be made available at the same cost per annum as a normal ten-year licence.</P>
    <P>Most Members of the House supported the introduction of the national car test. It is amazing that the introduction of such a scheme had not taken place previously. It promises to deliver safer cars on our roads and the removal from those roads of cars that are not safe and that are a danger to life and limb. However, in the rush to get the scheme up and running, the Government overlooked a small but, for those affected by it, hugely important problem. I refer to the difficulties the scheme, as it currently stands, is causing for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The problem is straightforward and with a bit of imagination &ndash; if the Government is capable of it &ndash; it is easy to solve. How do we enable pensioners and older people to meet the costs they face in paying test fees and having to upgrade or replace their cars? It would be a disgrace if, by ignoring their plight, we ended up forcing them off our roads, turning them from citizens, who in their golden years can travel to the shops, to mass and to visit their relatives, into prisoners in their own homes. Effectively, this would mean they would have to rely on others for transport and no longer have their independence. This would not be because they are no longer physically able to drive or cannot put petrol in the tank or pay their insurance like anyone else, but because, if they survive on their old age pension, they do not have the money to pay for the necessary upgrade to get their car through the national test.</P>
    <P>They could all go to their local bank manager and ask for a bank loan, but is that what we want? Do we want queues of elderly people, begging their local bank manager for help to be allowed to be able to keep driving their cars? What reaction would those with an old age pension get from the banks, particularly when they do not have Ansbacher or similar accounts to offer the bank manager? At best, they will spend the rest of their days paying off bank loans to give them the privilege of keeping their cars on the road.</P>
    <P>Older people deserve better treatment and respect. Fine Gael's proposal is that a basic subsidy should be offered to those over 65 to enable them to meet the costs of the test and any reasonable costs above a certain amount that they may face in upgrading or replacing their cars to make them national road test compliant. The costs would not be prohibitive and, in any event, the <Col N="1323" /> average citizen will have paid many times the subsidy in road taxes, car taxes and various other taxes over their working lives. All we would do is give back to some of our senior citizens some of their own money to enable them to keep their independence.</P>
    <P>However, we should go further. In considering the problems the national car test is creating for senior citizens, we should note and correct some other discrepancies, for example, the problem of the driving licence. Most of us must get our licences renewed every ten years. However, if one is over a certain age, one can only get a licence for three years. In many ways this makes sense because older people suffer a more rapid deterioration in their physical capacities than younger people and they need to have their abilities reassessed more often.</P>
    <P>However, it is not sensible that the average older person has to pay exactly the same fee for a three year licence as younger people, possibly with greater means, pay for a ten year licence. I understand there may be some movement on this issue and I hope that is the case. If so, the Government should take into account that, because of the system, senior citizens have further costs to bear in obtaining medical certificates, which I understand cost £20 each, for the renewal of such licences. Often they must also get such certificates, at a further cost of £20, for insurance purposes. In addition, there is a further loading, I understand, of up to 25% of the insurance premium because of age.</P>
    <P>It makes good and moral sense to treat our senior citizens with all the respect they deserve. Some 30 years ago, in an inspired act, the State gave senior citizens the right to travel free on public transport. It cost little but it made a monumental impact on the lives of many people. Today, we are faced with a similar choice and similar potential. At little cost, we could help many of those who live away from public transport, to retain the right to travel by their own means and retain their independence. There is no greater gift that we could give, and that we owe, to those who in their day helped to create the Celtic tiger we now enjoy and have a moral right to share with our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>The national car test was introduced as a result of EU regulations. However, we are introducing European standards in a situation where we do not have roads up to European standards and where the cost of a new small car is almost £2,000 more than in many other European countries. The test fee of £35 and the retest fee of £20 will bear particularly heavily on the elderly, many of whom are pensioners. The cost of a test and then a retest would consume more than half of a weekly pension. Furthermore, the burden will be much greater in a situation where it will be more expensive to bring old cars up to the test standard or have them replaced. The Fine Gael approach is that some support should be given to the elderly in such situations from the point of view <Col N="1324" /> of the cost of the test and retest by way of subsidy where it is necessary to expend more than £250 either repairing an old car or purchasing a compliant car.</P>
    <P>Many rural population profiles tend to be characterised by all too familiar patterns of scattered settlement, disproportionate numbers of elderly people living in isolation and low numbers of young people. Therefore, there is a deficit in the number and quality of services available. In concrete terms, transport services are among those items which are restricted for many rural dwellers. Even for the elderly who are entitled to a free travel card, it is not of much use if there is no railway or bus service available in their area. For this reason, many of them rely particularly on motor transport.</P>
    <P>The real problem is that many of these cars fail the test because they have to be driven through potholes and on badly maintained county roads. I am sure many of my colleagues will deal with this aspect. Many of the horror stories from the western counties and County Cavan will indicate why many of the cars fail the test. However, the response of the Government to date has been strictly bureaucratic. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has pointed out that the national car test has been established as a public private partnership and on a self-financing basis and that it is envisaged that all users of the NCT should pay for their tests as part of the general costs of private motoring. In general, I do not quibble with this approach, but it does not preclude the State providing support for those who need it and who are particularly badly affected by the introduction of the new national car test.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government, and particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, can only be described as heartless. He has not shown the slightest hint of understanding for elderly people whose car is literally their freedom and whose budgets are severely limited. Merely repeating the mantra that private motoring costs have not in the past received public subsidy is not an answer to the motion. The same could have been said in relation to telephone charges and ESB charges prior to the introduction of the free telephone rental allowance and the free electricity allowance. In any event, a subsidy is available for private motoring through the Department of Finance's scheme for the disabled, where there are substantial reliefs of VAT, VRT, motor tax and fuel tax for those who qualify. I favour further special measures for the disabled either through an extension of that scheme or by including them in the proposals I am making on behalf of the elderly.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonable case to be made for support for the elderly which I, on behalf of Fine Gael, have outlined. The costs involved would not be substantial but the relief to many of the elderly affected would be great. The funds are available to provide that relief and all that is required is the political will to put such a scheme <Col N="1325" /> into operation. The time to provide the relief is now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy behind the introduction of the national car test is fundamentally flawed in so far as pensioners have to pay for the test. If the Minister for the Environment and Local Government had thought through the cost implications of the scheme for pensioners there would be no need for my party to sponsor this motion.</P>
      <P>As with so many of the announcements which emanate from the Government, virtually no consideration was given to the ability of fixed and low income groups to pay for the test. It is clear that charging pensioners to have their cars tested for road worthiness is unacceptable and mean-spirited. By means of this motion the Government has an opportunity to right the wrong. I expect, in line with the Government's stated support for pensioners in its programme for Government, that charging for any testing and re-testing of cars owned by persons aged 65 and over would be abolished by resolution of the Dáil. This motion attempts to make sense of the Government's stated position in respect of protecting and enhancing the role of the elderly in society.</P>
      <P>No one could have predicted the colossal increase in the sale of new and second-hand cars as a result of the general buoyancy in the economy. I understand that in the first 20 days of this year over 31,000 new cars were sold &ndash; an increase of 60% over the same period in 1999. It is certain that only a tiny percentage of pensioners could afford the luxury of a new car, yet a car is the only source of transport available to many elderly people, particularly in rural areas but also in urban areas.</P>
      <P>For many the car represents not just a way of transport but a vital form of independence. In the main, pensioners are not a group who can be seen speeding around our roads in the latest BMW and one does not hear them boast loudly about the horsepower of their latest run-around vehicle. For an elderly person a car is not a virility symbol, as it is for others, but is essential for keeping in contact with others. The vast majority of people cannot understand why the Department of the Environment and Local Government decided so selectively to discriminate against pensioners in charging for the national car test. Some might argue that the £35 cost does not place a huge financial burden on most people but the additional costs in preparation for the test are considerable. Given that the majority of cars are failing the test, this leads to more expense for motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motorists over 65 are not clocking up the kind of mileage which Government Ministers and Formula 1 drivers put up on a regular basis. Their mileage is based on short journeys around their communities, journeys which represent vital links to family and friends alike. The EU directive, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, which requires the Government to establish a national car test scheme is silent on the subject of who should pay. <Col N="1326" /> As I understand it, the owners of taxi plate licences are the only group excluded from the test. The decision to charge pensioners had nothing whatsoever to do with the European Union or the Commission. What percentage of the 400,000 vehicles due to be tested over the next year belong to people in the age category stated in the motion? I suggest this is an imposition on a group of drivers who probably have more driving experience and, as such, actually increase safety on our roads. It is ludicrous to penalise experienced drivers through the imposition of this scheme which is setting out to discriminate against a group which is not responsible for the horrific carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is not present and has regularly decided not to present himself to answer the charges, but I hope he comes to the House before the debate concludes tomorrow evening. He has told the House on numerous occasions of the seriousness the Government attaches to the issue of tackling road safety. It has been suggested by the Minister that the national car test is part of the Government's strategy on road safety as set out in the document, The Road to Safety.</P>
    <P>I accept the need, as does my party, to test the road worthiness of older cars but it is not true to suggest that people are being killed on the roads because of mechanical problems in cars. This point was correctly highlighted recently when a spokesman for the National Safety Council said car safety standards are not one of the major causes of road fatalities. Members on all sides would agree that in the vast majority of cases, the reason for an escalation of accidents and deaths on the roads is due to speeding, drink driving and the non-wearing of seat belts, not mechanical or exterior problems with cars.</P>
    <P>This motion provides me with an opportunity to assess the work of the Department in the area of road safety. While the Department talks up the national car test regime more fundamental questions should be posed concerning a range of measures which were proposed last year but not yet implemented. For example, where is the much promised legislation to introduce the penalty points system? What action will the Minister take to enforce proper national standards for driving instructors? Precisely when will a learner driver be able to obtain a driving test within a year? Why does the State allow about 250,000 provisional licence holders to drive without an experienced driver? If the Government was serious about improving road safety a much greater percentage of the time of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, would be devoted to dealing with the real causes behind road fatalities in Ireland instead of introducing a scheme which penalises the most experienced group of drivers in our community.</P>
    <P>The national car test is important in terms of improving the general standard of vehicles. It is wrong that the test should be portrayed as a panacea to the problems of road safety because <Col N="1327" /> nothing could be further from the truth. If an analysis of cars were to be taken I think it would show that the vast majority of such vehicles had passed the national car test. If we are serious about reducing road deaths and accidents, the issue of driver competence and performance must be prioritised in any national campaign. The mechanical and external condition of cars cannot be used as an excuse for poor driver concentration, speeding or drink driving. Some have suggested that the car test might well contribute to road carnage. A survey conducted in the US has shown that drivers tend to drive more aggressively and take more risks when assured of the safety of their vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Government should act at international level to compel car manufacturers to produce vehicles which are not a danger to all road users. Television advertising which boasts the performance of cars which can go from 0 mph to 60 mph in ten seconds or less helps to create the environment of danger which surrounds the manufacture of cars.</P>
    <P>In November 1999 the Government published the review of its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats specifically mentioned the contribution of the role of the elderly. The review states that &ldquo;Our older people have made this country what it is&rdquo;. We must ask where the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who has responsibility for the elderly, was when the national car test proposals were submitted to Government? Did he or his colleagues raise any questions concerning the additional financial burden to be placed on the elderly? The Government should have foreseen this problem. It now has an opportunity to undo the damage by supporting the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls on the Government to provide a subsidy for the elderly. If people over 65 years of age have to acquire a new or second-hand car to ensure compliance with the new national car testing scheme it is only fair that a subsidy is provided to enable them to do so. This proposal would, in effect, reintroduce the scrappage scheme but under very strict criteria. We have already established a range of free schemes and benefits for the elderly, such as the free bus pass and free TV licence. It is only right that these provisions are extended to take cognisance of the national car testing scheme.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Government to respond to this motion with generosity. The motion provides Ministers with an opportunity to translate their platitiudes into tangible benefits for the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all agree that cars should be road worthy and safe, not all accidents are caused by older cars. Some of the most serious accidents involve high-powered new cars. Such cars, travelling at high speeds, do much more damage than older cars travelling at modest speeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Consider the case of an old age pensioner in an area like Connemara, far removed from towns and cities and with no rail or bus service, in such an area the car is not a luxury but an absolute necessity. The typical driver drives a 1980s Escort which he uses to take his wife and himself to Mass on Sunday and to go to the mart or elsewhere once or twice during the week. A person who uses a car for such purposes should not be asked to pay £35, half his weekly income, for a first test and £20 for a second. He cannot be compared with a driver who uses his car every day and who earns £200 or £300 per week. If a motorist in such an isolated area hits a pothole on his way to the car test &ndash; I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is not in the House for this debate &ndash; his wheels will be out of line and it will fail the test. If he is lucky enough to have his car pass on the second or third attempt and hits a pothole on his way home, his wheels will be out of line for the next two years. The test does not ensure that cars are safe and it defeats its purpose.</P>
    <P>Exempting old age pensioners from the car test fee would be a mere token gesture. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be familiar with the hardship this fee will cause to many people in the constituency we both represent. Older people are generally very independent and do not wish to rely on their neighbours to drive them to Mass or to the mart. They are entitled to maintain their independence and to have their cars tested free of charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour, in principle, of the introduction of a national car test in order to ensure that vehicles are of a consistent, high standard. The number of road accidents is unacceptably high relative to other European countries and if by improving the standard of vehicles on our roads we make a small contribution to overall road safety, I welcome that positive progress. However, we should not over-emphasise or exaggerate the effect of the introduction of a common safety standard on the roads. As several Deputies have pointed out, the impact of the national car test on road safety is not great.</P>
      <P>The main factor influencing the timing of the introduction of the car testing system was the necessity to be in line with European standards. However, the introduction of a car test in Ireland does not have the same implications as in other European states. This is primarily because of the quality of our road surfaces, particularly in rural Ireland where the condition of roads is far below the standard of other member states. As a result, the expense involved in preparing a car for a successful test in Ireland is very high compared with other European countries because of the damage our roads do to cars. A number of rural Deputies and councillors even suggested that we delay the introduction of a national car test until the quality of our roads has been significantly improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New car prices are much higher then in other EU countries. This also adds to the cost of driv<Col N="1329" /> ing. Our grossly inadequate public transport system means that many people are forced to drive their own cars because they have no alternative. This is particularly true in rural areas and even in my own constituency which borders the second largest city in the country.</P>
    <P>The motion concentrates on assisting one section of society, our senior citizens and pensioners, perhaps the most vulnerable section of all. Many pensioners, particularly in rural areas where public transport is limited, have cars which do not do a high annual mileage but which are a vital link with neighbours, shops, the church and the nearby town. This is a vital link for which pensioners should not have to pay. I ask the Government to look on this motion sympathetically and generously and ensure that pensioners do not suffer a financial burden in order to use their cars when they have no alternative means of transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion ably proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe. Our senior citizens have experienced hardships unknown to the younger generation and they deserve to be shown flexibility and leniency by the Government.</P>
      <P>A pensioner brought to my attention an anomaly in the car testing scheme. When this man went to buy a car from a registered car dealer he found that there is no facility within the national car testing scheme for a registered car dealer to have a test carried out on a car when it is being sold. The pensioner buying the car cannot be given a certificate from the national car test by a registered car dealer. The car must be tested when it becomes due for a test. It would be much more realistic to allow a registered car dealer to have the road-worthiness of a car independently validated before it is sold. This would be good for the purchaser who can be sure the car is road worthy It is good for the dealer because it enhances his reputation and it makes good common sense.</P>
      <P>If a pensioner decides to buy a second-hand car he cannot be given a certificate by the dealer. They must wait to have the car tested and will probably have to bring it back to the dealer to have the matters identified attended to, doubling the expense. As Deputy O'Keeffe and others indicated and to use a pun, we are deliberately driving down the elderly at a time when they should be free to enjoy themselves and appreciate their independence. To an elderly person a car is a priority. It gives them the independence to leave their home, drive to town, go to mass, do the shopping, visit friends and go for a walk by the lake or at the seaside. At a time when the coffers are overflowing and there is unprecedented wealth, the Government is asking the elderly to pay the same charge as everybody else. That is unfair, it hurts their pride, stabs at their independence and is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>A new era in road safety has begun. <Col N="1330" /> It has been said that this measure will result in lower insurance costs and reduced emissions but it will definitely lead to an increase in new car sales and a greater demand for car servicing. In the next 12 months an estimated 500,000 cars registered before 1992 will be tested. In 2001 all vehicles registered between 1992 and 1996 will be liable for testing. From 2002 onwards all cars four years and over, including those examined this year, will be tested. This is major business. Of the 500,000 cars it should be possible to determine the percentage owned by senior citizens. The cost of the test is £35. However retests which do not require the use of computerised equipment are free.</P>
      <P>Primary and secondary safety criteria are applied. What this means is that cars with defective important components such as headlights, brakes, steering, tyres and seat belts automatically fail the test. It is the owner's responsibility to rectify minor faults, for example, problems relating to the speedometer, door locks, horn etc. It is stated that it is anticipated that over time many of these advisory defects will become a mandatory reason to refuse a test certificate. The national car test centre is currently failing cars on these grounds. It is also stated that car repairs should not cost in excess of £100. Currently it is nowhere near this. This matter needs to be clearly assessed. It is further stated that previous failure defects such as poor wipers will be reclassified as advisory, but I know for certain that cars are being failed on these grounds. It is said that cars can have a range of relatively minor defects and still pass the test, but that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny made an important point, that the will of senior citizens is being broken. They take great pride in their cars. As the mileage is often relatively low they are being penalised unfairly. I appeal to the Minister to accept this excellent motion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> As a nation we are never satisfied to be good Europeans, we have to prove our European credentials. We have to be better than the best. That is certainly the case when it comes to enforcing EU regulations. I am all for hygiene and sensible hygiene standards to ensure cleanliness in food safety, but the punitive level at which we have pitched our interpretation in enforcement of the so-called EU regulations relating to hygiene has been farcical. Irish officials' over-interpretation and implementation of diktats from Brussels have put hundreds of small clean family butchers out of business, closed down dozens of cottage food manufacturers and put the &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign on a countless number of food outlets, and all the while the traditional bistros, crêperies and charcuteries of France continue to trade merrily because of the French authorities' liberal interpretation of exactly the same rule book that we enforce so stringently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is exactly the same with the NCT system. The first seven and a half weeks of the new scheme seemed to be designed to prove to <Col N="1331" /> the rest of Europe that &ldquo;anything you can do, we can do better.&rdquo; It is absolutely ridiculous to reject a car because one windscreen wiper is of a different colour, and that has happened. It is a nonsense to turn somebody down because the rear seat belts have slipped down behind the upholstery, and that has happened. It is farcical to turn somebody down because an indicator bulb blew <i>en route</i> to the testing centre, and that has happened on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>The credibility of the scheme is being seriously undermined. I fully support the principle and concept of the test, but it is clear that the standards here are more exacting than those in Britain and other EU countries. The fact that only a small fraction of accidents are caused by defective vehicles is clear evidence that the general standard of motoring maintenance is quite good. The harsh reality is that for hundreds of experienced and careful drivers they will be banished and permanently off the road because of the manner in which the standards are being applied. Many of these individuals are on modest incomes and use their cars to travel to and from work. Many are old age pensioners on a pension of £80 per week who cannot afford to replace their cars or pay the bills to rectify the so-called defects. The vast majority use their cars to travel to town once a week, go to church or visit relatives. Without a car they are lost, isolated and immobilised.</P>
    <P>That is the reason Fine Gael is pleading a special case for senior citizens to help them remain mobile in their twilight years. I ask the Minister, therefore, to adopt the Fine Gael resolution and to examine critically the standards being applied to ascertain if they synchronise with those in Britain and other EU countries. As Deputy O'Keeffe said, so what if we devise an Irish solution to an Irish problem. We cannot have European standards unless we have roads of European standard. While we have a few major Euro routes, the vast majority of our roads are pothole marked and crater ridden. What we are asking for is consistency and common sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. One cannot argue against the overall policy of car testing, a most important factor in road safety. There has been a huge increase in the number of cars and it is vital, therefore, that all cars are up to standard. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should establish a special committee to investigate the causes of fatal accidents. The Garda Síochána has tried to enforce speed limits by way of introducing speed traps, but the carnage continues. Most fatal accidents and the majority of serious accidents happen in the early hours of the morning, a time when old age pensioners are seldom out. The Government has, therefore, made a fatal error in not considering the elderly in introducing the scheme. The same cannot be said of benefits such as free travel, free fuel, free television licence, free electricity and the living alone allowance. Good and bad <Col N="1332" /> Governments make mistakes. An error of judgment has been made in this case. As in the case of the credit unions, the test is whether the Government will do the honourable thing and honour our senior citizens.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the arrangements now in place for the National Car Test which ensure an efficient and affordable quality service to all customers and provide benefits to road safety and the environment; and notes the commitment already made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce legislation, as soon as practicable, to permit more equitable driver licence fee arrangements for persons over 70 years of age.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe need not worry. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will answer him tomorrow night.</P>
      <P>Motoring is the transport mode serving the greatest part of the country's mobility requirements. Some 29 billion vehicle kilometres are travelled in Irish cars each year. Rapid economic growth is generating a corresponding increase in the car fleet. At the end of 1998, there were 1.2 million cars registered, compared to 750,000 at the end of 1988. The benefits of this widespread use of the car are obvious in terms of business, social and personal mobility and convenience, but there are also disadvantages, among them the greater threat to road safety, traffic congestion and increased pressure on the environment and amenities.</P>
      <P>Car ownership and use has always involved significant private costs. The latest estimates by the Automobile Association of standing and operating costs of motoring indicate a typical figure of £5,000 to £6,000 as the total annual cost of running a small to medium sized car. Approximately £800 to £900, or some 15%, of this amount relates to servicing and part replacement costs necessary to ensure that a car remains in good and safe running condition. Based on CSO household budget surveys, it would be reasonable to estimate that in households which run a car, up to 18% of the household spending can be related to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the commencement of motorised transport, it has been accepted that responsibility for <Col N="1333" /> all costs of this kind, including servicing and part replacement, should rest with the private motorist. Private motoring has received no public subsidy in Ireland, or in so far as my Department is aware, in any other country.</P>
    <P>There has been a long-standing legal duty to maintain a car in a safe condition and in compliance with specific requirements as to construction, equipment and use. This obligation on car users is not new and it long pre-dates the introduction of the national car test. None of this has been considered by successive Governments to justify a departure from the general principle of non-subsidy of private motoring costs. Against this background, I wish to explain the recent history of the national car test project and indicate the Government's position on the matters addressed by the motion.</P>
    <P>Many countries, within the European Union and beyond, have been operating mandatory car testing regimes as a means of reinforcing the general legal duty to maintain a car in safe condition. In 1991, a harmonising EU directive was introduced in relation to testing, which included for the first time mandatory requirements of car testing on the basis of specified safety parameters. EU testing requirements for heavy goods vehicles had already been introduced in the 1970s and were later extended to light goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>In the case of member states which had no previous experience of mandatory testing of private cars, the relevant EU directive provided for delayed implementation of a new testing system beyond the generally applicable deadline of 1 January 1996. A number of members states, including Italy, Denmark and Ireland, which had no tradition of mandatory testing, availed of that derogation. Ireland was, therefore, among the last of the EU member states to introduce compulsory car testing.</P>
    <P>The then Government decided on 8 October 1996 that car testing would be introduced to meet the requirements of the directive. The then Minister for the Environment was authorised to seek competitive proposals to operate the car testing system nationally on a self-financing franchise basis. This decision was without reference to any question of subsidy. The party proposing the motion was in Government when that decision was taken. To the best of my Department's knowledge, no age related or other subsidy or discount operates within the mandatory car testing arrangements of any other EU member state.</P>
    <P>The charges now associated with the NCT arise from an international competitive process undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and are designed to ensure the selection of the most efficient and economically advantageous tender offering the lowest test fees over the life of the contract. What the NCT will add to motoring costs is a fee of £35 every two years and an additional £19.80 for a re-test if the car fails on a limited number of safety critical items. For this relatively modest outlay, motorists will receive a top quality highly computerised <Col N="1334" /> diagnostic assessment covering some 57 different items.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's specification, operation of the NCT is self-financing by way of test and re-test fees. The contracting company, National Car Test Service Limited, is obliged to operate the service in a way which is, at all times, free of any actual or potential conflict of interest arising from any commercial association whatsoever with any aspect of the motor industry. High standards of test integrity and excellent standards of customer service are also obligations set out in the contract between the NCTS and the Minister. These are enforceable by way of financial and other penalties where the agreed performance standards are not achieved and maintained.</P>
    <P>The Government is well aware that costs will arise from the NCT process in order to prepare cars for a successful test or rectify them for a re-test. In so far as these repairs relate to safety critical items, it is wrong to relate them simply or principally to the NCT. The repairs involved are required more fundamentally by the legal duty to maintain a car in a safe condition so that the safety of all road users is respected.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken considerable care to ensure that the NCT is not operated bureaucratically or in a way which would emphasise minor and non-safety related faults. The car testing regulations distinguish between primary and secondary safety critical items. A test certificate is refused where lights, brakes, steering, tyres, seat belts are in a dangerous condition or where exhaust emissions are beyond acceptable environmental limits. Other reasons for failure will be advised to the owner for responsible action by him or her. This approach will help to reassure car owners that essential safety is the fundamental reason for the national car test.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the environmental benefits arising from the introduction of compulsory car testing. We are all familiar with the smoky fumes associated with poorly maintained engines. They are an infringement of social responsibility and a polluter of the environment. As well as smoke from diesel engines, car engines will also be tested for emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon. These tests will assist in the protection of people's health and the environment.</P>
    <P>So much of industry and tourism is founded on Ireland's clean and green environment that we should not hesitate to welcome measures which act to protect it. The Government's amendment to the motion, therefore, duly welcomes the introduction of the national car test because of its environmental benefits.</P>
    <P>In 1997, there were 472 fatalities on the roads. This is an appalling toll in tragedy visited on families year in and year out. That is why the Government in 1998 launched its strategy for road safety. The strategy specified a minimum 20% reduction in fatalities to be achieved by 2002 as its primary target. A number of new policies and actions were also adopted to support the strategy. These <Col N="1335" /> included the extension of the use of automatic speed detection systems, including the installation of fixed speed cameras, the commencement of evidential breath testing for drink driving, the extension of on-the-spot fines to non-wearing of seat belts and other offences and the development of a penalty points system which would trigger disqualification following repeated driving offences.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made with these measures and Members will probably be aware of the substantial improvements in road safety which have been taking place over the past two years. However, what can be overlooked is the host of other less prominent supporting measures, which are also being introduced. The regular roadworthiness testing of private cars is one such measure. It stands to reason that all road users are safer if we are assured that the national private car fleet, in addition to all commercial vehicles which have been subject to testing for some years now, will also be subject to a regular road-worthiness test. Only in this way can all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians, be assured of the increased safety status of the vehicles that they meet on the road.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House asks that the test and re-test fees for those 65 years and older should be free of charge, and that where repairs to a car would cost more than £250 a subsidy should be given so that a replacement car can be bought that would be at most three years old. What is being proposed is that subsidies should be taken from general taxation, paid by many who cannot afford to own a car at all, and given to those who would qualify by virtue of having reached 65 years and being in possession of a car.</P>
    <P>It is not clear what size of subsidy is in mind, but a full subsidy could mean up to £10,000 per claimant. It would seem also to be open to benefit from the subsidy on a recurring basis in the event that the car later failed the test and necessitated repairs above £250. This feature could be seen as affording reward to persons who do not maintain their car as conscientiously as others. It could become hugely attractive for individuals to put their cars in the name of a parent or friend of 65 years or older. It would be impossible to police such a scheme and the drain on the taxpayer would be enormous.</P>
    <P>In contrast to other areas of private expenditure, motoring costs have not been the subject of social subsidies, except for the case of drivers with disabilities. For example, older people or other social welfare assisted classes enjoy no concessions relating to motor tax or fuel tax. It would be invidious and socially divisive to provide for subsidies to car owners from moneys raised from general taxation including the contributions of those who cannot afford to own a car.</P>
    <P>Part of the motion refers to driving licences issued to persons over 70 years of age. As Deputies are aware, the driver licensing regulations provide that such persons must undergo <Col N="1336" /> medical review for driving licence renewal purposes and are restricted to either one or three year licences depending on the opinion of their respective doctors. The requirement to have a medical report submitted in respect of persons aged 70 or over is not at issue. These requirements are reasonable and necessary in the interests of the individuals concerned, other road users and road safety generally.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that this is not a new requirement imposed by this Government. This requirement dates back to when the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1964, introduced the concept of requiring persons who suffered from prescribed medical conditions, and persons over 70 years of age, to submit certificates of fitness for driving licence renewal purposes. At that time, persons generally had the option of applying for either a one or a three year licence. However, those who suffered from prescribed medical conditions or were over 70 years of age could be restricted to one year licences if, in the opinion of their doctor, they required annual medical review.</P>
    <P>Between 1964 and 1989, the average annual cost of driving licences was the same for all licence applicants, irrespective of whether a one or three year licence was obtained. The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 introduced the concept of ten year driving licences. Such licences are not available to persons required to undergo more frequent medical review on account of a prescribed medical condition or to persons over 70 year of age.</P>
    <P>Deputies should also be aware that such reports are not only required in the case of those over 70. They are also required where an applicant for a driving licence is suffering from certain diseases or disabilities specified in the Second and Third Schedules of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 or has suffered in the past from epilepsy or alcoholism or is taking, on a regular basis, drugs or medicaments which would be likely to cause the driving of a vehicle in a public place to be a source of danger to the public. In addition, all applicants for driving licences for the higher categories of vehicles, trucks and buses, must submit a medical report each time they renew their licence.</P>
    <P>The question of the refund of the cost of these medical reports is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who has advised me that the general medical services contract, which governs the provision of general practitioner services for medical card patients, does not include the issue of medical certificates or reports relating to driving licences and that he has no plans to amend the contract in this respect. For those who are ineligible for the medical card, there can be no justification for meeting a cost which, albeit medical in nature, is nevertheless discretionary and does not relate to medical need,</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the issue being raised regarding the annual cost of a driving licence. Persons <Col N="1337" /> under 60 years of age can apply for a ten year licence at a fee of £20. This works out at an average annual cost of £2 per year, while persons aged between 60 and 67 can apply for a licence expiring on the day preceding their 70th birthday at a fee of £20. The average annual cost of such a licence is determined by the age of the person on the date of issue of the licence. However, persons aged over 70 years can only apply for either a one year or three year licence at a fee of £4 and £12 respectively. This results in an annual average cost of £4 per year as compared to £2 per year for a person who has the option of taking out a ten year licence.</P>
    <P>Although the licence fee has not increased since 1989 and the cost is relatively low by today's standards, there is an inherent inequity in the way that the licence fee structure applies to persons over 70. I am also conscious of the fact that they incur additional costs by having to undergo a medical examination and provide photographs on a more frequent basis.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all these factors, my Department carried out a review of the overall driving licence fee arrangements with a view to developing a more equitable licence fee arrangement. Arising from this review, it was decided to introduce revised licence fee arrangements which will be structured more favourably towards persons aged over 70 years. The Minister of State for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, conveyed this information to the House in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 123 on 27 January 2000. As indicated then, legislation is necessary to implement this change.</P>
    <P>Until 1998 such change could have been implemented by way of an amendment of the Finance Act as driving licence fees were an excise duty set out in the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, as amended by section 52 of the Finance Act, 1989, and could be varied as part of the annual budgetary process through an amendment of the Finance Act. However, since the Local Government Act, 1998, driving licence fees now accrue to the local government fund and it is no longer appropriate for the fees to be varied by means of an amendment of the Finance Act as part of the national budgetary process. It will be necessary to amend this provision by means of an amendment to the Local Government Act and my Department will avail of the earliest suitable opportunity to provide for the necessary change in the licence fee structure.</P>
    <P>The Government is at one with this motion relating to providing a more equitable driver licence fee structure for persons over 70 years of age. I reject the other elements of the motion which attempt to introduce Government subsidy, or other cross-subsidisation, of private motoring costs in a way that would be unprecedented in the Irish experience or that of other countries.</P>
    <P>The national car test will provide a fair and customer driven service and will benefit road safety and the environment. Its framework was designed by the last Government and continued by this <Col N="1338" /> Government. We must allow it the freedom to operate to the benefit of Irish motoring and other road users. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has conceded, in some respects this Opposition motion is good, specifically the point about driving licences mentioned at the end of his speech. It is easy for me as a mere backbencher to say this. It is different for a Government to take action. When in Government one has to do what is right rather than what is popular. A motion such as this is not really typical of Fine Gael, but more like one I would expect the Labour Party to put down.</P>

      <P>That is what I put this down as. I agree that the point made by the motion is echoed by many elderly people. The NCT has brought hardship to some elderly people. The cost of the car test is not really the problem but what happens when the car fails? Many cars are failing and that is a problem. The 15 year old car of a person I know well, failed a couple of weeks ago. There was no way he would get hurt while driving it because it was a large car. He used to drive about 30 miles an hour and if he had ever run into anything, he would not have got hurt. If, however, a little gurrier stole his car some night and drove it on the M50, it might be a different ball game. That is what we must look at.</P>
      <P>I accept many elderly people say their car is not great but it will do them as long as they are able to drive. That attitude exists, and probably more so if they live in a rural area. However, the Government has introduced this test, although Governments stalled it as long as they possibly could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy quoted our programme for Government. We have given effect to the needs of the elderly, specifically in regard to the old age <Col N="1339" /> pension. We have given increases of £5, £6 and £7 over the past three years which compares favourably to the increases given by the previous Government of £2.20, £3 and the princely sum of £1.80. That is how we have given effect to our concern for the elderly and not by this measure. I accept some of the points Deputy Hayes made are valid and are being made outside the House. If the Deputy's party wishes to include them and implement them in its programme for Government, that is fine.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for people with large cars which are failing on emission grounds because they are probably doing only 2,000 miles per year while the rest of us are doing 20,000 miles per year. They will probably say we are all entitled to discharge a certain percentage of emissions into the air, that they drive only 2,000 miles per year and that they are not the cause of the emission problem. They have a point. I wish there was some way to deal with this but I understand the Minister's point about controlling usage. How does one manage it and how does one ensure that car is driven by one person only? If that was possible, I would like to think something could be done.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the NCT and the booming car sales have created an enormous problem in parts of Dublin. I do not know whether this problem was looked at, but nothing was done about it. There is a large number of bangers around and nobody knows how to get rid of them. Basically, people cannot get rid of their old cars or their NCT failures. It may not be an issue for the Department of the Environment and Local Government alone but a number of Departments need to get together quickly to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>If one goes to trade in an eight year old car, a garage will not take it, particularly if it is taxed for six months. A garage cannot sell it on to somebody else because people will not buy without a clear certificate and it cannot get a national car test done on it because the disc has six months to run. That should be changed &ndash; it is a stupid regulation.</P>
    <P>People are selling their cars to scrap yards and travellers. Travellers are taking a few parts out of them and are selling them on to kids and to anybody and everybody for £40. Kids are driving around in these cars and this will become a much more serious problem when a few people are killed. These kids are being stopped by the gardaí who are confiscating their cars. The gardaí cannot cope with the number of cars. The gardaí in Finglas have stacked these cars outside the Garda station and the residents are complaining. They could try to bring them to the large compound in Santry which holds 300 or 400 cars, but it is packed to the rafters. They must hold these cars for six weeks even if they are junk, which is crazy.</P>
    <P>If we are bringing in a national car test, which is creating a problem, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the <Col N="1340" /> Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform need to pull together and do something to get those bangers off the road. We need more compounds where cars can be held. We need to change the law so that any car which is more than five years old could be disposed of in ten days. Perhaps newer cars could be kept for a couple of weeks. We need other such changes because the situation is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I said this to somebody the other day and he asked what could people do with their old cars other than bring them to Dunsink Lane. We need an advertising campaign run by the Department or the local authorities telling people where to bring old cars or cars which failed the NCT, whether to Hammond Lane or the corporation yard. Perhaps we should give people £25 or £50 to provide some carrot to encourage them rather than allow these cars to litter the streets.</P>
    <P>This is a considerable problem, although it may not relate directly to the issue about which we are talking tonight. The Department, however, has introduced this measure and it must look beyond it. Kids are driving around in cars but the gardaí cannot stop them anymore because they have nowhere to put the cars. Keeping cars for six weeks is crazy. There will have to be a more formal procedure for people who wish to decommission their cars and the laws need to be strengthened in this regard. I know one must fill in a form but that does not seem to work. We will have to get tough in this regard and pursue people.</P>
    <P>If I sell a car to the travellers, a scrap yard or a back lane or a front street garage, it is not good enough if that car ends up in the hands of a 15 year old. We are sitting on a potential time bomb whereby people will be injured or killed by kids driving some of these cars. This has always been a problem and is not one which emerged the day the NCT came in. However, it has become greater and the supply of such cars has gone through the roof. I am sure Deputy Hayes, who is from a similar part of Dublin, faces the same problem.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform need to sit down, bring forward amendments, change the regulations and find somewhere to put these cars which are potentially very dangerous when they end up in the wrong hands and are liable to cause terrible injury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ryan and Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. I support the Fine Gael motion which deals specifically with the impact of the new national car test on elderly people. The impact of the national car test, however, is not confined to the elderly. It affects poor people in particular. It also has environmental consequences which have not yet been adequately addressed, although Deputy Ahern touched on some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party is not opposed to the <Col N="1341" /> national car test. This country has had to introduce it on foot of EU regulations and, arguably, we have been late in implementing them. We all agree that with road deaths running at more than 400 per year, unsafe vehicles should not be on the road. We agree that vehicles which are found to be unsafe should be taken out of use. The issue which has to be addressed is how this desirable objective is to be achieved and who will pay the penalty.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough, and is certainly not fair, to implement such a policy without taking into account the impact on those who are most likely to be affected by it. There is no doubt but that the national car test is a test which hurts poor people. By and large, those who own the 440,000 cars which are more than eight years old are people who cannot afford a newer model. They are people on low incomes who can just about afford to buy a second-hand car and keep it on the road, elderly people many of them living in remote rural areas who need a car to keep in contact with relatives and to drive to the nearest village, the stay at home parent who needs a small cheap car to do the shopping and run the children to school and to their out of school activities and the woman in the middle of some soulless suburban estate who is trying to rear her children on her own and can just about afford a car which gives her mobility, independence and a measure of freedom. In virtually all such cases the journeys undertaken by the motorist are short and local and contribute little if anything to the rate of road accidents or to the overall level of pollution.</P>
    <P>The national car test will put many of those people off the road or, failing that, force them into debt to finance the purchase of a newer car. This is not the first time a measure has been introduced by a Progressive Democrats Minister, which has been ostensibly about improving the environment but which has had a damaging effect on poor people. It reminds me of the way in which bituminous coal was banned in this city to rid it of smog, something with which I, and I am sure most people, agreed, but the way in which that measure was introduced took no account of the impact it would have on poorer people, many of them elderly who could not convert to cheaper fuels. I recall there was a grant to enable people convert to cheaper fuels but that was abolished and many poor people, particularly elderly people, were literally left in the cold. Many statistics highlight the impact on health of the smoky air we had prior to the banning of bituminous coal. Since its banning, however, very little attention has been paid to the impact on the health of those people who have been literally left in the cold because they have not been able to afford to heat their homes or convert to cheaper fuels. They have been forgotten about.</P>
    <P>The same principle is being applied to the national car test. I am not arguing against these measures. Smoky fuel had to be banned to clear up our air and the national car test must be intro<Col N="1342" /> duced to make our roads safer and to reduce pollution, but the impact on those who are most affected, poorer people, should have been adequately assessed before this test was introduced and balancing measures should have been put in place to lessen the impact it would have on them. In particular, there has been a continuing necessity to improve public transport and provide an adequate school transport system. The Government should consider the proposal not to charge for the test for a period of time so that those switching to the car test regime and are first to be hit by it are not penalised. The motorists who are being penalised immediately are those with older cars. The motorists who can afford a newer car will not have to pay for the test until 2002 or thereafter, but the motorists who have to pay for it now and will have to pay for it in two years' time &ndash; if their cars do not pass the test the first time, they will have to pay a second charge and, ultimately, if they fail the test, will have to bear the cost of replacing their cars &ndash; are the poorer people who can just about keep their cars on the road.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister of State blaming the previous Government for this type of car test. The Government produced the regulations and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, signed them. Instead of shifting blame every time a controversial issue is raised, it is time Ministers had the courage to take responsibility for their actions, but the way in which this test is designed will encourage car replacement rather than the conservation and prolonging the life of cars.</P>
    <P>An environmental case has been made for the test on the basis that it will possibly reduce the level of emissions. That is a difficult case to make when, as Deputy Ahern said, one questions whether a motorist who drives 2,000 miles a year in an old banger contributes as much damage to the environment as a motorist who drives 30,000 miles a year in a high speed chariot that guzzles gas.</P>
    <P>An environmental aspect that has not been adequately considered is the concept on which this test is based &ndash; that a car starts to become dodgy after it is four years old. That suits the motor manufacturing industry. It suits the motor industry to have a regime whereby after four years a car owner must get his or her car tested and after another two years it may fail the test, so that by the time a car owner has paid off the loan on the car, it is obsolete and must be replaced. This test will encourage more and more of that. We should have a test that puts the onus on the car manufacturer and on the car industry to produce a better quality vehicle that does not have inbuilt obsolescence as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>One way of doing that might be to address an issue Deputy Noel Ahern raised about what to do with old cars. Responsibility for the removal and management of old cars should revert to the manufacturers and suppliers. As long as responsibility for that is left with the motorist, the car industry has an inbuilt incentive to continue to <Col N="1343" /> produce poor quality cars with inbuilt obsolescence, cars designed and manufactured to become obsolete after four, five or a few more years. If there was a regime whereby responsibility for the removal, destruction and management of the waste of old cars was put back on the manufacturers and suppliers, we might well get motor vehicles that would last must longer and that would not fail the current test.</P>
    <P>The argument for the car test has been made on grounds of road safety. Anything which makes our roads safer, evenly marginally so, is welcome. Evidence has not been produced by Government to show that older people driving in older cars contribute most to road accidents. The new rich whizzing around in high speed chariots are much more likely to contribute to road accidents than a motorist who drives a short distance, often locally, in an old banger. If the Government wants to seriously address road safety, it should address the length of time a provisional driver must wait to do the driving test, the state of our roads and the introduction of the new road safety Bill that was promised as a result of the Government's review of road safety measures which reported last year. That legislation has still not been produced and it should be produced very soon as evidence that the Government is serious about addressing road safety and is not simply administering a test to fuel the vested interests of the motor industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I support the motion. In principle, the national car test is a welcome new initiative. It will improve road safety and environmental standards and bring us into line with practices common among our partners in Europe. The introduction of the national car test is causing genuine problems for many people in our community, especially the elderly and people living in poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should any of us be surprised at the way the Government treats our elderly, paying lip service to them? With great fanfare, Members and the representatives of the elderly were brought together for the launching of the United Nations International Year of Older Persons. The aim was the development a society of all ages, a new and positive vision of ageing in Ireland so that through inclusion, recognition and representation, the rights and needs of older people would be asserted in all aspects of Irish society. It was about independence, participation, care, self-fulfilment and dignity. However, time and time again the Government has paid lip service to the elderly. The principles include independence for older people &ndash; older persons should be consulted and supported on how and where they want to live; participation &ndash; older persons should be valued members of their community with opportunities to remain active in political and social life and in the life of their community; care &ndash; older persons are entitled to the same standard <Col N="1344" /> of health; self-fulfilment &ndash; older people should not be denied the opportunity to get involved; and dignity &ndash; older persons are entitled to respect and fair treatment.</P>
    <P>Can older people say that since this Government came to power it has recognised the needs of the elderly? It had a unique opportunity this year to provide the elderly with a pension of £100 a week. A £6 billion surplus was available to the Minister for Finance. The Government decided not to give it to the elderly but to hold on to it for an election year and to try to con the people. However, the days of conning the people are gone. The way the national car test has been implemented is another indication of how uncaring and unthinking this Government is in relation to the effect of its decisions on communities.</P>
    <P>The national car test involves a flat rate fee for individuals, regardless of their means. These fees amount to £35 for the original test and £20 for a re-test. For thousands of people in Ireland these costs, in addition to the cost of repairing a car that may have failed the first test, are punitive. It will force people off the road and increase the growing isolation which older people currently experience, particularly those who live in rural areas where public transport is non-existent. We in this House are aware of the lack of public transport and the utter dependence on private transport to go to church, to the pub for a drink in the evening or to socialise with a friend or a relative. In the implementation of this scheme, no consideration was given to the knock-on effect.</P>
    <P>We hear the same old refrain from the Minister when he answers questions in this House. It has become the standard response of a number of Government Ministers when confronted with their policy failures to deny all responsibility and blame the last Government. It is evasion and cowardice which would try the patience of any national school teacher. The Minister is charged with introducing the regulations which govern the national car test. He was not bound by any decisions of the previous Government and the mess he has created cannot be passed off like that. The Minister cannot duck his responsibility and the House is holding him to account for his actions.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House calls on the Government to recognise the burden placed on older people by the fees involved in the national car test and to introduce a waiver in respect of them. As Deputy Gilmore pointed out, the imposition of test fees also affects low income families living in poverty. I hope the Minister will address this matter in a reform of the regulations. On behalf of the elderly, I hope the Minister will take on board the consensus view in evidence here and amend the scheme.</P>
    <P>Many older people have cars which are in fine condition but are a number of years old. Most of these cars are used only a few times a week. Trips are generally not made during rush hour and do not add to the chaos that clogs up our cities and towns during peak hours every morning and <Col N="1345" /> evening. An analysis of road traffic accident statistics shows clearly that such vehicles are not generally involved in the appalling carnage on roads that costs so many lives today. However, a large number of elderly motorists are now faced with the prospect of being forced off the roads due to the expenses involved in this new national car test. If this happens it will be a tragedy for our older population. Simple tasks, such as getting the shopping and visiting grandchildren, will suddenly become major logistical events. Older people will be forced to depend on the charity of neighbours and relatives just to get about and do their business. It will restrict the freedom and independence of our older population and increase their feeling of isolation, especially in rural areas. The Minister should be well aware of the effects in his constituency. I am delighted that there are Government backbenchers who are prepared to tell the Minister what effect this will have on rural life and on the lives of our elderly.</P>
    <P>We owe the elderly a large debt of gratitude for sacrifices they have made which have contributed hugely to our current economic success. However, the Minister has ignored this and has decided to impose significant charges on older motorists, charges which will take a large chunk out of the fixed weekly income on which the vast majority of them have to depend. The Minister had the means this year to give the elderly a pension of £100 per week. He decided to give to the super-rich rather than to the people who have made a significant contribution to building up society. The Minister had an opportunity to acknowledge this contribution, but he has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>This evening the Minister has an opportunity to recognise his failings and agree to redraft the national car test regulations so that older people are not penalised. He would have the full support of the House and of older people. The amount of income foregone due to this progressive reform would not obstruct the overall operation of the scheme and could easily be provided for from the Exchequer. The scheme is important and should be brought in. However, the Minister should take cognisance of the problems it is causing for people who have worked to bring this country to the point it is at. The Minister will have failed if he does not take account of the clear message that is being sent to the House on this matter. He should accept the principle of the motion and act upon it accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will be familiar with the company involved. Up to 14 February, when an official liquidator was appointed, Kel Electronics was a highly <Col N="1346" /> specialised sub-contracting company. It produced printed circuit boards for the Irish and European markets, with a highly skilled an professional workforce, some of whom had been with the company and its predecessor for more than 15 years. Some of the employees had only recently left school. All the workers were surprised and shocked when unexpectedly and without any prior notice the company was put into liquidation, with the result that 70 people were put out of work.</P>
      <P>The company had been operating with a fully trained workforce. The research section was involved in a huge amount of work and the company's order books were full. A supply of orders was coming in on a regular basis and the firm's customers were very satisfied with its high quality products. In fact, the staff were working overtime to meet the demand for the company's products. They had also qualified for the ISO 9002 and a number of other certificates. At the start of this year the prospects for the company appeared to be very bright and it was looking forward to increasing its orders and taking on new employees.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development, the agency for the area, had approved a plan for the company to take on additional workers and had approved grant aid of £5,000 per job for an additional 100 people. One can imagine, therefore, the anger, shock and frustration of the people in the company which has now closed down. The liquidator is in possession and I compliment him on the manner in which he has communicated with the employees and local representatives who went to see him about the situation. He has a job to do, however, and in light of these circumstances it will be a difficult one. We hope that at the earliest opportunity it may be possible to re-establish the company and complete some of the existing orders. I appeal for the liquidator to take back some of the staff in order to do this. The customers who supported the company up to now could thus be assured there would not be a loss of confidence in the personnel or products in the event of the company being restarted.</P>
      <P>Up to 70 people were employed at Kel including quality controllers, assembly workers and machine operators. There was also a range of accountancy and other financial personnel employed, as well as production managers and stores people. The staff were bewildered when the closure announcement was made. I condemn the fashion in which workers learned of the company's closure in the newspapers. At a time when there has been great co-operation between employees and management, this operation left much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People were shocked to find that the doors were closed and they were out of work. Most of them, who did not have long records of employment, received the bare minimum legal entitlement of one week's notice. They have been left in a very difficult financial situation and the sudden collapse of the company has left them angry. <Col N="1347" /> They are mystified about the reason for the closure. In most companies that experience difficulties there are indicators that orders are not going out or that there is a problem at management level or elsewhere. In this situation there were no such indications; the order books were full and people were working overtime. The staff want to know what happened and if the situation can be rectified. They want to know if the plant can be reopened or sold on to some new developer, thus enabling those who were employed there to be re-engaged.</P>

      <P>On Monday, 14 February, the High Court appointed a liquidator to Kel Electronics on foot of a petition by one of its creditors to have the company wound up. The company was stated to have debts of more than £430,000 and all creditors supported the winding-up petition. As normal in a High Court liquidation, the legal position is that all contracts of employment in the company are terminated, following the appointment of the liquidator who is now assessing the statutory entitlements of the workforce. It is now the responsibility of the liquidator to assess the financial position of the company and its future prospects.</P>
      <P>Regarding labour payments, the liquidator will have all of the appropriate documentation relating to employee statutory redundancy, arrears of wages and holiday pay, and minimum notice entitlements, with the appropriate sections of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, by close of business today. The average period required for processing these claims administratively is about four to six weeks for employee statutory redundancy, four to eight weeks in respect of arrears of wages and holiday pay, and it can take up to three months in respect of minimum notice entitlements.</P>
      <P>Kel Electronics Limited, formerly known as Neltronic Manufacturing Limited, was established in Ennis in 1986 as a printed circuit board sub-contract assembly operation. In late 1998, Kel became part of the UK-based Karavale Enterprises Group which has other electronics manufacturing facilities in England and Wales. The project, which was announced by the Tánaiste in 1998, involved the relocation of the old Neltronic Manufacturing operations from Shannon Development's enterprise centre to a modern 26,000 sq. ft. advance factory in the new Ballymaley business park.</P>
      <P>Kel Electronics' sister company, Karavale Enterprises, over-traded and ran into difficulties during the second half of last year. As a result, local financial institutions have been treating Kel with caution. With significant growth in Kel's sales occurring towards the end of last year and with a healthy order book going forward, Kel found itself with both capital investment and working capital funding problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> Various attempts to attract outside investors have failed. A petition to wind up the company was made on Friday last by Ennis Industrial Properties Limited which claimed that Kel had failed to pay quarterly rent of £25,637. All creditors supported the winding-up petition. Shannon Development is currently working with the liquidator with the objective of securing the operation as a going concern. Already a number of prospective investors have been identified and have been made known to the liquidator. I am confident that a successful outcome can be achieved. I will bring the Deputy's interest in the matter to the notice both of the relevant officials in my Department and to Shannon Development, immediately.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me and my colleagues, Deputies Connaughton and Michael Kitt, to raise this matter of importance to the East Galway constituency. Last Friday saw the shock announcement of the decision by AT Cross to withdraw its manufacturing process from Ballinasloe back to the United States. The decision has had a devastating effect not only on the company's workforce and their families, but also on the economy of Ballinasloe and its hinterland. After 27 years of manufacturing in Ballinasloe, the decision came as a complete shock. AT Cross was a good employer. The workforce has the distinction of not having had one hour of industrial unrest over that period. Such loyalty has been badly rewarded by last Friday's decision.</P>
      <P>I question the announcement of that decision. The Tánaiste is absent, even though she has connections with the region, but I ask the Minister of State when he learned of this decision. In normal practice he would have learned of this decision weeks or months ago. What has he done in the meantime? What have the Minister of State, who is from the constituency, and the Tánaiste, who has overall responsibility for job creation in the country, done? Have they sat on their hands and done nothing? Has the Tánaiste visited or requested a reprieve from the parent company? When she visited the United States recently did she visit the parent company in Rhode Island? If so, why has she not taken action to ensure a reprieve since? Those questions must be answered by the Minister of State tonight. He owes it not just to the employees and their families but to the industrial environment of Ballinasloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure the Minister of State and the Tánaiste alone should take the blame. I challenge the sincerity of the IDA. What has it done with regard to job creation in Ballinasloe in the last 26 years? Not been one job has been created in Ballinasloe with the assistance of the IDA &ndash; nor in many other towns in Galway apart from Galway city. Is there an industrial cartel in Galway city sucking practically every job created in the west into it at the expense of other towns, particularly Ballinasloe? The Minister's predecessor in the rainbow coalition saw the terrible injustice being done and wanted to level the playing field. <Col N="1349" /> I challenge the IDA to tell us what industrialists they brought to Ballinasloe to create jobs in the interim. I can find neither trace nor track of anyone who was encouraged by the IDA to come to Ballinasloe. There must be something wrong when IDA means Galway city growth.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Tánaiste to assign importance to Ballinasloe and to give east Galway a fair crack of the whip regarding job creation. We need such job creation as it has not happened heretofore other than through private investment. I ask the Minister of State to come clean about when he knew of this decision and what he did when he discovered it. Will he find out if there is an opportunity for a reprieve? If not, will other jobs be created in Ballinasloe in the near future? It is important for all our sakes that this be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State is here, although I am disappointed the Tánaiste is not. We know what everyone from east Galway wants, including the Minister of State, but the Tánaiste should be here.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that people in Ballinasloe are devastated by this. When they find out how bad the news is they will be even more devastated. It has come to notice that we are not talking about 100 jobs. There were 240 pay packets at AT Cross two weeks ago, but there will only be 60 after this, as 100 full time jobs and almost 80 part time jobs are affected. This is a disaster of the highest order. I am also told that manufacturing is to be stopped and the plant is to become a distribution centre. If so, it is the next step to closing the factory completely. There is no connection between a corporate body in the US and a distribution centre in Ballinasloe. We know what that means.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister of State knew, but the Tánaiste should have known about this. If so, we should have been told about this a long time ago. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State must now address two fundamental matters. One is the pursuit of AT Cross to maintain a manufacturing presence at Ballinasloe. I understand the vice-president of the company is in Ireland and I hope the Tánaiste, the Minister of State and the unions get the opportunity to talk to him tomorrow or the day after. I see nothing wrong with the four east Galway Deputies also meeting him. The other issue is that the IDA must now deliver a worthwhile industrial project which will form part of the strategic plan for Ballinasloe for the future. Everyone knows there were only three legs to Ballinasloe's industrial strategy, in three well known factories, but now one of them is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never had greater inward investment into Ireland and the Minister of State knows that there are deals going on for industrial projects all over the country. It is our turn for a place in the sun. We have waited far too long and it is up to the Government to make sure the IDA's next industrial project goes to Ballinasloe. We have been side-stepped many times and for many <Col N="1350" /> reasons, but never for the right reason. Real regional development is needed and if the regional strategy is to have legs, Ballinasloe must get the next industrial project. I am not talking about a small project but a substantial one. We have many advantages &ndash; an excellent workforce, good infrastructure, an industrial park and good sewerage, water and schools. We also have easy access to Dublin, Galway and Shannon. We have everything, we know the inward investment is there and there is no reason for the Government, and the Tánaiste in particular, not to be able to deliver to Ballinasloe. I expect an announcement to be made in the next couple of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Ulick Burke and Connaughton for sharing their time with me. I also thank the Minster of State, Deputy Treacy, for addressing the matter. The loss of 100 jobs has left Ballinasloe reeling, although there have been rumours of lay-offs for some time. I find it amazing that SIPTU, which represents the majority of the 150 workers currently employed at AT Cross, was not informed of any difficulties at the company. I was also amazed that I could get more information from Mr. Harry Casey's report last week in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> than from any other source. Mr. Casey could tell us some days before the loss of jobs was announced that the chief executive officer at the parent company was &ldquo;reviewing total operations with a view to reducing costs and improving profitability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The company said the review would take a number of months and it assured employees and their representatives that they would be kept informed of the situation. However, the SIPTU branch secretary stated that she was not kept informed and the trades union was negotiating with the company on conditions for long-term temporary staff at the company. I pay tribute to AT Cross for its investment in Ballinasloe and to the employees. Every effort should be made in coming months to find alternative employment for them.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the IDA have been promoting Ballinasloe over the last 18 months and are developing a business park &ndash; the IDA has almost completed a new 25,000 square foot advance factory in Ballinasloe, so there are positive developments. However, in view of the fact that AT Cross once employed over 370 people and we are told that only 60 jobs will remain, there should be an assessment of the space that will be available at AT Cross for alternative industry, although of course we want those 60 jobs to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State and the Tánaiste, who was born in Ballinasloe, to continue their work in promoting the town for new industry and I would like the Tánaiste to visit the town as soon as possible. She has visited the town on a number of occasions and was very positive in her remarks about the town when opening the Ballinasloe October fair. However, the sad situation is that Ballinasloe has had no new major industry in over 27 years. It has received urban renewal status, <Col N="1351" /> new urban council offices have been built in the town and a new marina has been sanctioned. Major investment has also been made in Portiuncula hospital, money has been provided for a local health centre and we have invested in our local schools.</P>
    <P>The black spot in all of this has been unemployment and the lack of job opportunities. It is imperative that the Government takes action to provide alternative employment in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my three colleagues from Galway East for raising this serious matter on behalf of the constituency. AT Cross established its plant in Ballinasloe in 1972 to manufacture and market high quality writing instruments for the European and Asian markets. Its parent company, the AT Cross company of the USA, is a major international manufacturer of fine writing instruments and also manufactures pen-computing products.</P>
      <P>On Friday last, 18 February, it was announced that as part of the recent restructuring of its worldwide operations, AT Cross is to consolidate its writing instruments manufacturing operations at its facility in Rhode Island, USA. This move will result in the loss of 100 full-time jobs and up to 90 temporary jobs at the company's Ballinasloe facility. The consolidation was necessitated by continuing severe losses over the past five years. As a result, the Irish facility will primarily be used as a European logistics and distribution centre for the European, Middle East and African markets. AT Cross proposes to retain 60 full-time staff in Ballinasloe who will continue to be employed in these activities. The transition is expected to be completed by the end of July.</P>
      <P>By consolidating its Irish and US manufacturing operations, the AT Cross Corporation has stated that it will be able to operate a more efficient manufacturing operation and realise the commensurate cost benefits. It has also stated that it greatly regrets having to reduce its Irish workforce and that the decision to do so was a very difficult and painful one. However, in order to ensure the future success of AT Cross, the corporation has stated it has had to make these decisions across the globe.</P>
      <P>I am personally deeply disappointed by this sad news. The company has been a very good employer and a keen supporter of local initiatives over many years. It is a severe blow to all of the excellent workers involved and my sincere sympathy is with them. AT Cross has stated that it appreciates everything which its employees and the Ballinasloe facility have done for the company and that, where possible, it will assist workers in the coming months to find alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main emphasis now is to find alternative employment opportunities for these dedicated workers who are to lose their jobs. IDA Ireland has been intensively promoting Ballinasloe over the past 18 months. It has worked closely with <Col N="1352" /> the local chamber of commerce and the two local authorities, Ballinasloe Urban District Council and Galway County Council. Over the past year, the IDA has acquired land to develop a high quality business park of circa 40 acres. The entrance to the business park has been completed and the various services to the park have been installed.</P>
    <P>The IDA is also in the process of completing the building by a local developer of a new 27,000 square feet advance factory on this park which will be ready by the end of next month. In line with its strategy of intensifying the focus on the Objective One region, IDA Ireland is actively promoting these new units for activities such as health care, medical devices, engineering, electronics, customer services, shared services and e-commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the closure of the MKIR Panasonic plant in Dundalk. The loss of 360 jobs in the town is not just a body blow to the workers but is a tragedy for their families and communities. Today's newspaper reports of 115 new jobs in the plastics plant in Dundalk are welcome but the creation of 115 jobs over a five year period will not meet the need for 360 new jobs in the next six months.</P>
      <P>During this period of economic boom, there has been a general consensus that job losses are a thing of the past. However, last week brought us back to reality with the announcement of the loss of 360 jobs in Dundalk, 130 jobs in Donegal and the threat of 190 job losses in Ballinasloe. We cannot take our jobs boom for granted.</P>
      <P>County Louth is one of the few counties which has failed to reap the full benefits of the current boom and Friday's news further damaged morale in the county. While I appreciate the efforts of the IDA and others to bring new industry into Dundalk, there is much more to be done. Many of the workers who will be made redundant as a result of this plant closure are raising young families and attempting to repay high mortgages. Their financial commitments can only be met through employment and they will not be able to afford to survive on inadequate social welfare payments in June when the factory closes. The local SIPTU official, Jane Bushell, has stated that the workers' situation is bleak and that while they are highly skilled, their skills do not necessarily match those required in the expanding Xerox plant in the town. That is why I am calling for the establishment of a jobs task force which could assess the workers' skills levels and ensure they will receive any necessary up-skilling training required to make them job-ready by June.</P>
      <P>It should be the remit of this task force, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the IDA to make concerted efforts to attract replacement jobs for workers who cannot be facilitated in existing factories. The loss of 360 jobs will have a negative impact on local businesses unless urgent action is taken to ensure the workers are not forced to sign on when they cease to be employed in five months. I hope that none of the 360 highly skilled workers will be forced to live on inadequate social welfare payments and that they will find alternative employment without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State that Dundalk is fighting hard to reap the benefits of the peace process and our economic boom. I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will establish a task force to ensure these job losses are only a temporary setback. There were over 3,000 job losses in the footwear, clothing and textile industries in Dundalk town when I was general secretary of the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers Union. I know the hardship the people <Col N="1355" /> have suffered. I ask the Minister of State to make an effort to redress that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share fully his disappointment at the announcement of the closure of the MKIR Panasonic plant. MKIR is a wholly owned subsidiary of Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics, MKE, of Japan, one of the world's leading producers of electronic and electrical products. MKIR in Dundalk was established in 1992 to manufacture hard disk drives for the European computer industry. Due to severe over-capacity and pricing pressures in the marketplace, increased production costs and declining sales prices, the Matsushita Kotobuki division, which specialises in the manufacture of hard disk drives, is being reorganised.</P>
      <P>The group's only European manufacturer of hard disk drives is based in Dundalk. The Irish operation has been trading at a loss. The group has examined a range of options to reverse this loss making trend, including further cost reduction, improving productivity etc. Despite this, however, the cost structure in Ireland is still substantially higher than other group companies, all Far East based. As a result, the parent company in Japan has decided that the Dundalk plant, which employs 360 people, will be closed and production transferred to other group companies in Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The company has stated that it is committed to giving every assistance and support to its employees to find alternative employment in the months ahead. The company will co-operate fully with IDA Ireland in meeting all its liabilities and in promoting its facility for a replacement industry. The loss of these jobs is a severe blow to the employees concerned and finding alternative employment must be a key priority. Fortunately, the Louth region has both shared in and contributed to economic growth and has seen tremendous development in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the job loss announcement is clearly a major blow to the workforce affected, employment prospects generally are very positive in Dundalk at present. Xerox is in the process of developing a major technology park in Dundalk, the construction of which is well advanced, and has already recruited 285 people, with job numbers to increase to 2,100 by the end of 2003. The Xerox company has already had a major impact <Col N="1356" /> in Dundalk, both in terms of investment and increasing business confidence in the area, and has developed strong links with the Dundalk Institute of Technology and with the local chamber of commerce.</P>
    <P>In another significant development, ICL, one of the world's leading IT companies, is to establish a 160 job software centre in Dundalk, which will specialise in the implementation and development of software applications, based on Oracle technology. This new centre will employ over 100 software developers within three years, consisting of highly skilled, high-tech third level graduates. Since its start-up last May, ICL has already recruited 30 people. Further good news emerged yesterday, with the announcement by Tessy Plastics that it is to set up in the IDA industrial park in Dundalk. An investment of £5 million is envisaged, which will lead to 115 jobs over the next five years. Its decision to locate in Dundalk, over other possible locations, is a major confidence boost for the town and augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>In view of the generally very positive situation in Dundalk, we do not propose to establish a task force at this time. However, I assure the Deputy and the House that the agencies will give every assistance to enable the employees at MKIR to find new employment. In that regard, FÁS has already been in touch with the general manager of the company. MKIR will contact FÁS to arrange registration and to discuss training needs. In addition, we have arranged for senior officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the State agencies to meet with SIPTU and worker representatives to outline the actions being taken to assist the workforce affected by this disappointing closure.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bell, especially as regards the footwear industry. My constituency has a traditional footwear industry and we are the last bastion of shoe manufacture in Ireland. While we want to ensure this continues, I realise that many of my colleagues have lost a wonderful industry which made a huge contribution to economic growth in dark and difficult times.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I will ensure his sentiments will be conveyed to the highest level of Government, our Department, the IDA and other State agencies to ensure we can find alternative employment for these unfortunate people as quickly as possible.</P>

      <QRef>[5039/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): There are a considerable number of farmers already involved in the production of high quality cattle. This number can best be increased by the introduction of partnership arrangements between meat plants and farmers. A more effective quality-based pricing system, with premium prices paid for top quality cattle, would also contribute to this development.</P>
    <P>As far as my Department is concerned, I have used the flexibility available to me through the national envelope to encourage the production of high quality beef heifers. In addition, the dissemination of information to farmers about appropriate breeding and farming practices to meet the specific needs of the market place is an ongoing process supported by my Department through the beef improvement programmes as well as through the supervision of the beef carcass classification scheme. The recently established Irish cattle breeding federation is working to devise specific breeding objectives for beef cattle production in Ireland. In addition, Teagasc has made a valuable contribution in this area over a number of years providing extremely useful information on best practices for quality beef production.</P>
    <P>Through all these developments, I am satisfied that significant improvements targeted on specific market requirements can be achieved by farmers producing high quality cattle.</P>

However, Bord Bia, which has responsibility for the promotion and marketing of sheepmeat, is planning to hold a number of workshops with processors, retailers and food service operators to develop more consumer-friendly lamb cuts. A new approach to the presentation of lamb cuts should enhance marketing opportunities as less time is now spent by consumers on the prep<Col N="1358" /> aration of food, and this is particularly so in the case of young consumers.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia is continuing to seek new markets for lamb and is involved in a generic lamb promotion campaign in France in conjunction with Interbev. It is also looking at markets in Scandinavia and a good market for Irish lamb is expected in the Mediterranean region in 2000. On the domestic front, it will conduct an Easter promotion campaign, followed in the summer by a barbecued lamb promotion.</P>
      <P>In addition, the national development plan will provide financial support for capital investment in the food sector. Part of this support will focus on added value products and, in particular, on the high value prepared consumer foods. This support is designed to encourage the processing industry to develop value added products and improve its competitiveness on the EU market.</P>
      <P>Many of the recommendations of the national sheep forum relate to the need to improve the efficiency of our production and the quality of our final product. These are essential features of any drive to withstand competition from other supplying countries and should be addressed on an ongoing basis by all involved with the sector.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 and my Department's proposals for the operational programmes to implement the aspects of the plan relating to agriculture provide for a number of on-farm investment measures, all of which are aimed at improving both competitiveness in production and environmental standards.</P>
      <P>Funding will be made available over the period of the plan for the provision of a farm waste management measure. It is proposed that aid will be available for investment in livestock housing as well as storage facilities for silage and farm waste. These investments will enable farmers to improve environmental standards and will also contribute towards improved farm practices leading to increased efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, provision is being made to assist in the improvement of dairy hygiene standards. This proposed measure is aimed at protecting the viability of existing dairy farms and securing high milk quality production standards. The grant aid will be available for both the upgrade of existing <Col N="1359" /> dairies and milking premises and the development of new facilities.</P>
    <P>A new development programme for young farmers is being introduced and this will provide additional aid for young developing farmers who carry out investment under the farm waste management measure and the improvement of dairy hygiene standards measure.</P>
    <P>All these measures will require that eligible applicants follow a nutrient management plan which will ensure that they will engage in more sustainable farming practices on their farms.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the existing national schemes will remain in operation until the proposed measures are approved by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>The western investment fund is considered to constitute a form of State aid and it therefore requires the prior approval of the European Commission for its operation. My Department has been in correspondence and discussion with the European Commission since June of last year when a formal request for the appropriate approval was lodged.

      <P>When I met Commissioner Fischler in Brussels on 6 December, I took the opportunity to express my concern at the time being taken by the European Commission in considering the request for approval of the fund. I also brought the matter to the attention of Commissioner Byrne at that time and again recently following the receipt of further queries from the European Commission. These queries have already been responded to and the Government's unhappiness with the slow progress has been communicated to President Prodi's office. Every effort is being made to resolve the matter and to allow the western investment fund to come on stream.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Western Development Commission that it has some 100 inquiries on hand regarding possible assistance from the fund. Some of these would be fully detailed projects capable of being evaluated for aid purposes. I expect that any projects on hand will be fully considered and adjudicated on once the fund is operational.</P>

      <P>Very significant levels of funding have been provided in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the support of agriculture and rural development. In total, some £6.7 billion is committed to programmes and measures which directly impact on rural areas. Specifically in so far as agriculture is concerned, some £3.4 billion is being made available in the period to 2006. This level of funding will allow for a major increase in participation in the REP scheme which already involves over 45,000 farmers and for further improvement in farm structures through continuation of the early retirement scheme, an increased installation aid payment of £7,500 and the introduction of a new development programme for young farmers.</P>
      <P>Substantial funding will be available for improved on-farm investment measures including schemes of farm waste management and improvement in dairy hygiene standards. These measures will be open to farmers with a minimum of 15 income units from farming and a maximum of 200 income units, including off-farm income. The schemes will, therefore, be open to an increased number of part-time farmers and should contribute to securing household viability on many of our smaller and medium-sized farms. In addition the very significant levels of direct payment provide a major support to farm incomes.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the BSE crisis in 1996, many markets outside of the EU restricted or banned imports of beef from Ireland. Following, in some cases, prolonged negotiations, all the traditionally important markets for Irish beef are now open.</P>
      <P>Although there was no ban placed on Irish beef by any EU member state, there was a loss of market share due to an increased consumer preference on some of those markets for their own, domestically produced, beef. The move towards renationalisation within EU markets was one of the issues addressed by the beef task force. Considerable progress has been made in regaining these markets but it remains one of the major priorities for the Irish beef industry to recover and consolidate its presence on EU markets. I have recently visited Italy, France and the Netherlands specifically to promote the consumption of Irish beef in those markets.</P>
      <P>The total volume of Irish beef exports increased to an estimated 545,000 tonnes during 1999 which included a growth of 15% to EU markets. The number of live cattle exported increased to 416,000 head, more than double the volume in 1998 and over seven times higher than in 1997.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make changes to the system which <Col N="1362" /> operates in Ireland to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota on a permanent basis at a reasonable cost over the coming years and that the Irish dairy sector is well prepared to face the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>On 13 October, I announced my intention to introduce by way of national regulations applicable from 1 April 2000 an arrangement for the transfer of milk quota other than the current system whereby such quota transfers with land. This is in accordance with the provisions that now exist under Article 8 (a)(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime, greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers, the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible and greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
      <P>Under the existing system of quota transfer linked to land, producers were often unable to expand their enterprises and realise their full potential because of the uncertainty within the quota system and the limited availability and cost of additional quota. Furthermore, in many cases producers were required to take on additional land which they did not need for their farming operation to acquire extra quota. This imposed an additional cost and made it difficult for small and medium scale producers to acquire quota. The option of temporary leasing quota existed, but this had the disadvantage that it operated only until the end of each quota year and did not give the certainty which active producers needed to expand their dairy enterprises.</P>
      <P>The exceptions to the new arrangements will cover family transactions, renewals of existing leases between the original lessor and lessee, sale of a holding as a going concern and the transfer by way of lease or sale of land purchased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000. Detailed conditions in relation to these exceptions will be defined.</P>
      <P>Apart from the exceptions outlined above, I have decided that, under the provisions of Article 8(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92, the transfer of milk quota will be through a scheme to be operated by way of a pooled system at co-operative/dairy level.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme, quota holders may, at the end of each milk quota year, offer all or part of their milk quota for sale to their co-operative/dairy. The co-operative/dairy in turn may only sell milk quota to producers attached to that concern under detailed rules that I will determine. While all producers will be entitled to purchase milk quota under this scheme, priority will be accorded to small and medium-sized producers.</P>
      <P>The maximum price for the sale of milk quota under this scheme will be fixed at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> With effect from 1 April 2000, it will no longer be possible for quota holders not engaged in milk production to temporarily lease their milk quota under the provisions of Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92 and Regulation 16 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, where the milk quota has been temporarily leased for the preceding three milk quota years (1997-8, 1998-9 and 1999-2000) or for a longer period.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000 such quota holders may resume milk production in their own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year, sell the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme referred to above, or transfer the quota with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply to my Department for an exemption from this provision. These exceptional circumstances will be detailed in the national implementing regulations.</P>
    <P>When the lease expires after 1 April 2000: the quota may be sold to the restructuring scheme, the lease may be renewed, the quota may be sold to the lessee without the land by agreement between the lessor and lessee, or the quota may be transferred with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>The arrangements I have outlined will be provided for initially by way of a statutory instrument and, if appropriate, subsequently by way of primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The decision on the changes I have proposed was taken following wide consultation both within the milk quota review group and bilaterally with organisations involved in the sector. They have received widespread support from the industry and will prove very beneficial to the sector in the competitive environment that lies ahead.</P>

      <P>Trade in food products within the EU is governed by the principles of the single market. The free movement of goods within the single market and the increased trade liberalisation that has taken place at an international level is very much to the advantage of the Irish food industry. In 1998, the value of our food exports, at just over £5 billion, was more than double that of our imports, and, in 1999, the <Col N="1364" /> value of our exports grew by a further 3% to £5.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia, which has statutory responsibility for the marketing of Irish food on export markets, operates quality assurance schemes in the beef, pigmeat and egg sectors. These schemes are aimed at ensuring safe, wholesome, high quality products capable of commanding a premium market position.</P>
      <P>A quality auditing scheme for horticultural food products is operated by Bord Glas. In addition, legislation is before the Oireachtas to give statutory effect to the national beef assurance scheme which will establish in detail the standards of Irish cattle and beef from production to marketing. In addition to the regulatory controls under which the food industry operates and which are supervised by the State agencies, including my Department, a number of voluntary initiatives are taken by the industry to improve standards.</P>
      <P>I am also in the process of setting up a quality assurance schemes review group which I am sure will make a significant contribution in this important area. The functions of this group will be to review quality schemes in operation in the light of future requirements of consumers and the food industry, to examine the accreditation procedures applying to each scheme and to make appropriate recommendations.</P>

Those initiatives provide for a total public funding allocation of £282 million and will be implemented as part of operational programmes that are being prepared.</P>
      <P>The action outlined in the national development plan provides a cohesive and comprehensive response to the needs of the food industry.

In this context, there will be a focus on added value and on the need to enhance the innovative capabilities of the industry. The indicative public funding allocation of £83 million for research and development will, in particular, assist innovation and product development.

      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make changes to the system which operates in Ireland to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota on a permanent basis at a reasonable cost over the coming years and that the Irish dairy sector is <Col N="1367" /> well prepared to face the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>On 13 October, I announced my intention to introduce by way of national regulations applicable from 1 April 2000 an arrangement for the transfer of milk quota other than the current system whereby such quota transfers with land. This is in accordance with the provisions that now exist under Article 8 (a)(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime, greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers, the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible, and greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
      <P>Under the existing system of quota transfer linked to land producers were often unable to expand their enterprises and realise their full potential because of the uncertainty within the quota system and the limited availability and cost of additional quota. Furthermore, in many cases producers were required to take on additional land which they did not need for their farming operation to acquire extra quota. This imposed an additional cost and made it difficult for small and medium scale producers to acquire quota. The option of temporary leasing quota existed, but this had the disadvantage that it operated only until the end of each quota year and did not give the certainty which active producers needed to expand their dairy enterprises.</P>
      <P>The exceptions to the new arrangements will cover family transactions, renewals of existing leases between the original lessor and lessee, sale of a holding as a going concern and the transfer by way of lease or sale of land purchased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000. Detailed conditions in relation to these exceptions will be defined.</P>
      <P>Apart from the exceptions outlined above I have decided that, under the provisions of Article 8(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92, the transfer of milk quota will be through a scheme to be operated by way of a pooled system at co-operative/dairy level.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme, quota holders may, at the end of each milk quota year, offer all or part of their milk quota for sale to their co-operative/dairy. The co-operative/dairy in turn may only sell milk quota to producers attached to that concern under detailed rules that I will determine. While all producers will be entitled to purchase milk quota under this scheme, priority will be accorded to small and medium-sized producers.</P>
      <P>The maximum price for the sale of milk quota under this scheme will be fixed at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000, it will no longer be possible for quota holders, not engaged in milk production to temporarily lease their milk quota under the provisions of Article 6 of Council <Col N="1368" /> Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92 and Regulation 16 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, where the milk quota has been temporarily leased for the preceding three milk quota years (1997-8, 1998-9 and 1999-2000) or for a longer period.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000 such quota holders may either resume milk production in their own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year, sell the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme referred to above, or transfer the quota with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply to my Department for an exemption from this provision. These exceptional circumstances will be detailed in the national implementing regulations.</P>
    <P>The following options will be available to the quota holder when the lease expires after 1 April 2000: the quota may be sold to the restructuring scheme, the lease may be renewed, the quota may be sold to the lessee without the land by agreement between the lessor and lessee, or the quota may be transferred with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>The arrangements I have outlined will be provided for initially by way of a statutory instrument and, if appropriate, subsequently by way of primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The decision on the changes I have proposed was taken following wide consultation both within the milk quota review group and bilaterally with organisations involved in the sector. They have received widespread support from the industry and will prove very beneficial to the sector in the competitive environment that lies ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the current trend in sheepmeat prices compared with 1999; the level of premiums and other income supports through REP schemes currently available to sheepmeat producers; the efforts, if any, being made to bring improvements in the EU sheep regime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Trends in sheepmeat prices so far in 2000 have been very encouraging. Prices have increased by 35% since the first week in January from 85p/lb to £1.14p/lb and are now 43% above the same week in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the ewe premium, the full ewe premium for 1999 amounted to £17.07 per head. In addition, sheep producers in the disadvantaged areas received a rural world premium of £5.23 per head and a basic headage payment of £10 per head in respect of the first 200 ewes in their flocks. Some £67 million of the premium has <Col N="1369" /> already been paid out and I expect the balance to be paid out shortly which will amount to approximately £30 million. Headage payments, amounting to £20.5 million were paid by the end of 1999 bringing the total headage and premium payments to £117.5 million.</P>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme does not include specific provisions relating to sheepmeat producers, but sheep farmers who participate in the scheme will qualify for a basic payment of 151 £119 per hectare up to a maximum of 40 hectares provided that they have observed the terms and conditions of the scheme. Higher rates of payment are available under the REPS in respect of land in target areas &ndash; natural heritage areas, farmland-based special areas of conservation or special protection areas and commonages.</P>
    <P>The existing REP scheme was closed to new entrants on 31 December last but a new scheme with substantially the same provisions as those described above has been submitted to the EU Commission as part of my Department's draft rural development plan for the period 2000-2006. The plan is being considered by the Commission at present.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions in recent years pointed out to the EU Commission both within the Council of Ministers and in bilateral discussions with the Commissioner the deficiencies in the sheepmeat regime. At the November meeting of the Agriculture Council I again referred to the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers because of the lack of convergence of prices across the European Union. The sheepmeat regime is being reviewed by the EU Commission at present. My Department had detailed discussions last month with the consultant and gave a full analysis of the regime and the adaptation and improvements required to meet Ireland's needs.</P>
    <P>An arrangement was made also for the consultant to be briefed by the sheepmeat monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>I also met recently with the French Minister for Agriculture to seek his support for a reform of the sheepmeat regime.</P>

      <Quest>if he will incorporate the existing organic organisations into the organic farming section of his Department to become an independent advisory, marketing and support organisation for farmers separate from Teagasc in view of the growing potential of organic markets here and abroad as outlined in a newspaper (details supplied).</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the organic organisations referred to are the three private limited companies approved by my <Col N="1370" /> Department under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91 to carry out inspections of operators involved in the organic crop products area. These bodies are already supported by my Department through annual contributions they receive towards the costs of inspections. Since 1994, more than £90,000 has been paid to them on a per-inspection basis. IOFGA has received £44,143, Organic Trust has received £39,376 and Demeter has received £7,240.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible to incorporate the three bodies into the Department as the Deputy suggests. In any event the organic sector is already strongly supported by the State services of Teagasc, Bord Bia, Bord Glas and the organic unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>Teagasc is the national body with responsibility for providing research, advice and training to the agriculture and food sector. In 1998 Teagasc conducted an organic farming needs study in conjunction with the three approved inspection bodies. Teagasc is in the process of assessing and responding to the needs identified in this study. The Teagasc organic unit at Johnstown Castle commenced research on organic milk production in July 1999, and research at this unit on organic cereal production has resumed in collaboration with the research centre at Oakpark. During 1999 a Teagasc staff member was assigned to provide training and advice to organic producers, and it is hoped to allocate additional advisory staff to this work as demand requires.</P>
      <P>The services of Bord Bia and Bord Glas are available in relation to marketing of organic produce.</P>
      <P>In 1990 an organic unit was established in my Department in response to the growing interest in and demand for organic food. Assistance to the organic sector is provided by this unit and in addition financial aid has been made available under the following programmes: the rural environment protection scheme for the conversion of land to organic farming and support for farmers continuing organic farming and EU Structural Funds under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry OPARDF 1994-99 for the development of the organic sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above support measures, the organic sector has been eligible for funding from: the Leader programme, INTERREG, Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and FEOGA grant aid for processing of agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant support for the organic sector will continue to be provided in the period to 2006 under the national development plan. While the three bodies referred to make a substantial and valuable contribution to the organic sector, there is evidence that potential organic operators are confused by the existence of three separate inspection bodies. For that reason I recommend that these three bodies consider seriously the benefits and cost reductions that could be <Col N="1371" /> achieved by the establishment of a single inspection body for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 90 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of TB reactor animals removed to slaughter in 1999 was 44,900. The incidence of the disease increased significantly in 1998 and 1999 over previous years, and the current levels are not acceptable. The increase referred to occurred across the whole country, and was matched by similar increases in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom. Veterinary experts here and elsewhere have not been able to establish the precise reasons for the increase in the disease incidence. Among the factors considered to be involved are the cyclical nature of the disease, higher cattle numbers, higher stocking density, poor weather conditions which may have made cattle more susceptible to the disease, fraud, and infected wildlife.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it has been agreed by all parties that measures will be adopted with the objective of reducing current levels of TB by 50% within the next four years. These measures will be finalised with the farming and veterinary bodies in the context of the animal health forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of export markets for Irish food products is primarily the responsibility of the food industry working in conjunction with my Department and Bord Bia. The meat industry exports to a wide range of markets worldwide. It is my objective to ensure that all these markets remain open to Irish meat exports and that all available market outlets are fully exploited.</P>
      <P>While the Irish share of the EU market for beef has fallen since 1995 because of the renationalisation of the EU market in the aftermath of the 1996 BSE scare, considerable progress has been made in regaining these markets. Irish beef exports performed strongly on continental EU markets in 1999 when exports to France increased by 14%, to Italy by 33% and to other EU destinations by 36%. Nevertheless, it remains one of the major priorities for the beef industry to recover and consolidate its presence on EU markets. In that context, I have visited Italy, France and the Netherlands in recent weeks specifically to promote the consumption of Irish beef in those markets.</P>
      <P>In the case of lamb, while there have been some moves towards renationalisation of certain markets, especially in France and Spain, Irish exports of lamb nevertheless increased by almost 6% in the past year. Bord Bia is continuing to seek new markets for lamb and is involved in lamb promotion campaigns in France and Scandinavia. A good market for Irish lamb is expected in the Mediterranean region in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996, Irish exports of pigmeat have increased by 35% to 135,000 tonnes and, despite the difficult market conditions, there was an 8% increase in sales last year. Exports to the UK are expected to strengthen during the year, sales to continental Europe are forecast to increase gradually during 2000 and the prospects for <Col N="1373" /> further increased exports to Japan this year are positive.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will provide financial support for capital investment in the food sector. Part of this support will focus on added value products and in particular on the high value, prepared consumer foods. This support is designed to encourage the processing industry to develop high quality value added products and improve its competitiveness on the EU market.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, will continue to endeavour to exploit opportunities in both the EU and international markets. Nevertheless, in the final analysis, it is a matter for the meat industry to capitalise on the high quality of Irish meat and I am satisfied that the State services provided to the industry through Bord Bia will help the industry to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>There was a high level of farmer interest in the recent series of seminars organised jointly by my Department and Teagasc. Initially 41 meetings were planned for the period between 10 and 20 January but, owing to the exceptional level of interest, an additional 25 meetings were organised. The series ended on 2 February, by which time more than 30,000 farmers had attended the 66 meetings.</P>
      <P>The meetings were arranged to complement the information booklet Guide to Agenda 2000 Changes sent individually to farmers in December 1999, and to provide a forum for farmers to seek clarification of the new requirements.</P>
      <P>The meetings were, therefore, concerned to ensure that farmers understood the changes to livestock and arable premium schemes arising from the Agenda 2000 package to minimise confusion and error when completing application forms, and to advise farmers how best to maximise their payments under the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the feedback received I am satisfied that the seminars made a substantial contribution to improving farmers' understanding of the changes and new requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed reports of questions asked and issues raised were compiled by my officials following each meeting. These reports are now being <Col N="1374" /> analysed with a view to identifying areas of potential difficulty and confusion to see how they may best be addressed. Particular attention will be paid to these issues when preparing scheme documents, guidelines, helpsheets and checklists.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the format adopted was of considerable assistance to farmers. It is my intention, as part of the measures I am adopting to make my Department's services more responsive to farmers' needs, to make further use of this information seminar approach where this will be helpful in familiarising farmers with developments in schemes and services.</P>

      <P>The organic farming sector is a fast developing sector and is reacting to the demands for produce produced in an environmentally friendly fashion. I expect the demand for organically-produced products will continue to grow and believe it is this increasing demand which will determine the area of agricultural land devoted to the organic production method. For that reason, it would not be appropriate to fix national growth targets for organically farmed land area. My primary concern is to build on the work already being done to ensure the integrity of Irish organic produce and to ensure that there are adequate supplies to meet demand.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, with supports available through REPS and the proposals for continued funding for the sector included in the national development plan and the rural development plan for 2000-06, Irish organic producers will be well placed to meet the increasing market demand.</P>

      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement provided for the payment of a slaughter premium on all cattle, including heifers, slaughtered in the EU or exported live to third countries. The slaughter premium will amount to £21.26 per head in 2000, £42.52 per head in 2000 and £63.78 in 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the Agenda 2000 agreement, some of the compensation to producers for the reduction in institutional prices is provided through a national envelope of funds over which member states have considerable discretion in allocating. I have decided that the £8.2 million available for the year 2000 will be distributed as a top-up payment on the slaughter premium. Under the arrangement, producers will receive a top-up on all beef breed heifers under 33 months of age slaughtered during 2000 up to a maximum of 160 per holding.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the top-up will amount to approximately £18 per head.</P>

In late 1999, following the discovery of the pest in the glasshouse crops of the grower in question, a ban was imposed under Directive 77/93/EEC on the movement of host material. The growers affected were advised that the remaining crops and weeds in the glasshouse should be destroyed and that no host plants should be planted without clearance from my Department. These controls would ensure the speedy eradication of the pest and the lifting of the movement restrictions.</P>

Further consultation is taking place this week with member states and this should open the way to early approval of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader-type activity in the period 2000-06. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader-type measure. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies, including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>

      <P>In the context of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision has been made for the funding of a scheme of farm waste management which will replace the current scheme for the control of farm pollution. It is proposed that the new scheme will be open to farmers with a minimum of 15 income units from farming and a maximum of 200 income units, including off-farm income.</P>
      <P>The grant will be calculated at the rate of 40% for farmers having up to 150 income units and the maximum level of grant aid under the scheme for these farmers will be £16,000.</P>
      <P>Farmers having 150 IU to 200 IU will be eligible for a 20% rate of grant to a maximum of £8,000. The net effect is that the scheme will be available to an increased number of farmers having off-farm incomes.</P>
      <P>Importantly, grant aid received under a previous scheme will not be deducted and the full grant amount will be payable in respect of eligible new works. The standard costings used to determine grant aid payable will be reviewed annually.</P>
      <P>Arising from the substantially enhanced nature of the scheme, I expect that many more part-time farmers will now be eligible to apply for grant aid in respect of approved farm waste management measures.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed eligibility conditions for the measure, an applicant must be the owner of the land or have leasehold title to the land for a period of five years and be the registered herdowner under the disease eradication schemes. In the case of lands jointly owned or leased, the eligibility criteria will have to be met by the owner/leaseholder identified as the registered herdowner and manager of the farm. If the herd number is registered in the name of two or more persons, the conditions of the scheme must be met by all parties.</P>

      <P>While it is regrettable that the overall numbers were higher in 1999, there are positive indications as regards this disease, in particular, that the age profile of animals infected with BSE is increasing.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make changes in the system which operates in Ireland to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota on a permanent basis at a reasonable cost over the coming years and that the Irish dairy sector is well prepared to face the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>On 13 October, I announced my intention to introduce, by way of national regulations applicable from 1 April 2000, an arrangement for the transfer of milk quota other than the current system whereby such quota transfers with land. This is in accordance with the provisions that now exist under Article 8 (a)(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime, greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers, the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible and greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
      <P>Under the existing system of quota transfer linked to land, producers were often unable to expand their enterprises and realise their full potential because of the uncertainty within the quota system and the limited availability and cost of additional quota. Furthermore, in many cases producers were required to take on additional land which they did not need for their farming operation to acquire extra quota. This imposed an additional cost and made it particularly difficult for small and medium scale producers to acquire quota. The option of temporary leasing quota existed, but this had the disadvantage that it operated only until the end of each quota year and did not give the certainty which active producers needed in order to expand their dairy enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exceptions to the new arrangements will cover family transactions, renewals of existing leases between the original lessor and lessee, sale of a holding as a going concern and the transfer <Col N="1381" /> by way of lease or sale of land purchased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000. Detailed conditions in relation to these exceptions will be defined.</P>
    <P>Apart from the exceptions outlined, I have decided that, under the provisions of Article 8(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92, the transfer of milk quota will be through a scheme to be operated by way of a pooled system at co-operative/dairy level.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme, quota holders may, at the end of each milk quota year, offer all or part of their milk quota for sale to their co-operative/dairy. The co-operative/dairy in turn may only sell milk quota to producers attached to that concern under detailed rules that I will determine. While all producers will be entitled to purchase milk quota under this scheme, priority will be accorded to small and medium-sized producers.</P>
    <P>The maximum price for the sale of milk quota under this scheme will be fixed at national level. With effect from 1 April 2000, it will no longer be possible for quota holders not engaged in milk production to temporarily lease their milk quota under the provisions of Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92 and Regulation 16 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, where the milk quota has been temporary leased for the preceding three milk quota years &ndash; 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 &ndash; or for a longer period.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000, such quota holders may either resume milk production in their own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year, sell the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme referred to above or transfer the quota with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply to my Department for an exemption from this provision. These exceptional circumstances will be detailed in the national implementing regulations.</P>
    <P>The following options will be available to the quota holder when the lease expires after 1 April 2000: the quota may be sold to the restructuring scheme, the lease may be renewed, the quota may be sold to the lessee without the land by agreement between the lessor and lessee, or the quota may be transferred with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>The arrangements which I have outlined will be provided for initially by way of a statutory instrument and, if appropriate, subsequently by way of primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The decision on the changes that I have proposed was taken following wide consultation both within the milk quota review group and bilaterally with organisations involved in the sector. They have received widespread support from the industry and in my view will prove very beneficial to the sector in the competitive environment that lies ahead.</P>

      <P>I am not disposed towards introducing a ban on fox hunting. From a welfare perspective, however, there are practices <Col N="1383" /> which had come to be associated with it which caused me concern. In August 1998, the Hunting Association of Ireland &ndash; HAI &ndash; which encompasses bodies which represent organised fox hunting in Ireland, announced rules and procedures which apply to the practices of digging out, bolting and earthstopping. This initiative was taken after I had conveyed to the bodies in question my concern about such practices.</P>
      <P>I regard this as a positive development and a welcome response to my expressed concerns. I have received specific written assurances from the hunting bodies in question that they are committed to ensuring compliance with and enforcement of these measures and to imposing severe sanctions on anyone found not to have complied with them.

      <P>The overall strategy of the Government for the development of the beef sector is to ensure that its full potential is realised thereby maximising its contribution to the national and rural economy. The achievement of this involves action on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>At EU level, I am satisfied that the Agenda 2000 agreement, which provided for the retention of our existing suckler cow quota and a 7.5% increase in a national quota for the special beef premium as well as satisfactory compensation for the 20% reduction in institutional prices, has provided a stable environment for the development of the beef industry at primary production level for the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At national level, the recommendations of the task force on the beef industry, which I set up in November 1998, have provided a blue print for <Col N="1384" /> the development of the sector from primary production to marketing. I have established a monitoring committee under the aegis of Bord Bia to oversee implementation of a number of these recommendations. The other recommendations will be implemented by the relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>As far as cattle breeding is concerned, my Department provides information about appropriate breeding practices to farmers to meet the specific needs of the marketplace through the beef improvement programmes and the supervision of the beef carcase classification scheme. The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, which deserves the full support of the industry, is working to devise specific breeding objectives for beef cattle production in Ireland and to review the breeding improvement measures already in operation here. In addition, Teagasc has made a valuable contribution in this area over a number of years and its booklet Breeding Better Quality Cattle from EU Markets, which was published recently, includes extremely useful information on best breeding practices for quality beef production. Through all these developments, I am satisfied that significant improvements targeted on specific market requirements can be achieved in cattle breeding and production. It is essential that the processing industry operates a pricing system which more effectively rewards quality beef production. This was recommended by the beef task force and its implementation is being examined by the monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to value added processing, the Government already provides and will continue to provide grant-aid under the national development plan towards the capital investment related to the production of value added products.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the marketing of beef is a matter for the industry supported by Bord Bia. The Government's objective in this area is to refocus the marketing effort on the EU market to build sustainable markets which are less vulnerable to changes in the EU market support system. The promotion activities of Bord Bia are substantial but they need to be supplemented by an industry-funded campaign which is not subject to EU constraints on marketing of products on the basis of their country of origin. My Department will also consider what additional resources need to be provided to Bord Bia in light of the marketing fund agreed at industry level.</P>

      <P>Aggregate farm income, as measured by the CSO, underwent con<Col N="1385" /> siderable fluctuation throughout the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1996, aggregate income increased by almost 23%. However, aggregate income has declined by almost 22% since 1996, as a result of the impact of the BSE crisis, poor weather and the collapse of the Russian economy.</P>
      <P>Average family farm income as measured by Teagasc's national farm survey has been much more positive. Family farm income was estimated at £6,682 in 1990 and this had grown to £11,042 in 1998, the latest year for which data is available. This represents an increase in average family farm income of 65% over the period 1990 to 1998.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that only around half of farm household income now derives from farming. The household budget survey of 1994-95, the last year in which a survey was conducte, shows that farm household income, including income from both on-farm and off-farm sources, was similar to that of urban households. The results also showed that only 53% of farm household income came from farming, with the balance deriving from other employment 31%, State transfers 12% and other sources 4%. Given the increasing trend in part-time farming since the survey, it seems likely that the contribution of income derived from off-farm sources to total household income is now more than 50%.</P>
      <P>It should also be pointed out that farmers' income, as with the rest of the community, benefited substantially throughout the 1990s as a result of reducing inflation and lower interest rates.</P>
      <P>It is too early to provide an accurate estimate of the likely outturn in farm income for 2000. I can say, however, that all the indications are positive and that an increase in farm income in 2000 is likely. A number of independent economic commentators have already forecast a substantial increase in farm income for this year.</P>

      <P>The manufacture and purchase of mammalian meat and bonemeal and its use in the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs is governed by the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) Order 1990, which prohibits the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to ruminant animals, that is, cattle, sheep, goats and deer, and the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) Order 1996, which sets out the licensing system applicable to the manufacture, purchase and use of mammalian meat and bonemeal.</P>
      <P>All licensing is on an annual basis. In 1999, 73 licences were issued, of which 35 are still valid. To date this year, 12 licences have been issued. At present, a number of licences are in the process of being renewed. The process of renewing or issuing new licenses is ongoing throughout the year.</P>
      <P>Mammalian meat and bonemeal produced in Ireland must come from plants approved under EC Council Directive 90/667 as transposed into Irish law.</P>
      <P>The production, movement and storage of mammalian meat and bonemeal is carried out under the supervision of my Department. Rendering plants involved in the production of mammalian meat and bonemeal must be licensed under the provisions of the 1996 Order, to manufacture this product.</P>
      <P>Mammalian meat and bonemeal may be incorporated into feedstuffs for feeding to non-ruminant species, that is, pigs, poultry and domestic carnivores, that is, dogs and cats. However, this must be done in accordance with the provisions of the 1996 Order which stipulates that anyone wishing to purchase mammalian meat and bonemeal and/or use it in the manufacture of animal feedstuffs must be licensed by my Department. Any person or company who wishes to use mammalian meat and bonemeal in the production of feedingstuffs intended for non-ruminant animals, in addition to a licence to purchase mammalian meat and bone meal must hold a further separate licence to have mammalian meat and bone meal on the named premises and to incorporate it into feedingstuffs intended for feeding to non-ruminant animals</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Premises for which a licence is sought, other than those of purchasers who are based in other countries, are assessed individually by Department inspectors for suitability under the pro<Col N="1387" /> visions of the above order. Licence holders, other than foreign purchasers, are subject to regular inspection of their premises and the audit of the use and destination of mammalian meat and bonemeal purchased. Licences are refused or withdrawn where my Department is not satisfied that the conditions are being observed.</P>
    <P>Breaches of this order constitute an offence under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. To date prosecutions under the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE) (No.2) Order, 1996 have been taken against two companies and one individual. Convictions were secured in each case.

      <P>The task force on the beef industry accepted the finding of the McKinsey report that there is at present underused slaughtering capacity in the beef sector in Ireland. It recommended that a better match between slaughtering capacity and cattle supplies could be achieved in the context of a development programme under which the provision of public funding for investment would be subject to strict criteria, including the achievement of greater economies of scale at slaughtering level. The task force also recommended that the processing industry itself should set up a special fund to facilitate the removal of surplus or obsolete capacity to expedite the process.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided under the national development plan to give priority to the beef sector at primary slaughtering and processing level in the context of the productive sector operational programme. This initiative, operating in partnership with the industry itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way and should encourage the industry to come forward with suitable projects. The creation of the special fund recommended by the task force is a matter for the industry itself.</P>

      <P>The sheepmeat forum, which I set up in 1998, identified a wide range of issues across all areas of the sector and agreed a comprehensive series of recommendations which, if implemented, would enable the industry to prepare for the challenges ahead. At the end of last year, I set up a monitoring committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Frank Crosby of UCD, to ensure that the maximum progress would be made on implementation of these recommendations. The committee is representative of all sectors of the industry and has already had a number of meetings, including with a consultant who is carrying out the review of the EU sheepmeat regime on behalf of the European Commission, where it outlined the concerns of the sheepmeat sector in relation to that regime.

      <P>Commonage land in certain district electoral divisions in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry is regarded as degraded or in danger of becoming degraded due to problems associated with overgrazing by sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> The position is that, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I introduced a national interim framework plan for all commonages in 1998. Under the terms of that interim framework plan, all sheep farmers with mountain ewes and commonage land in the six western counties who were not already participating in the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; were required to reduce their ewe numbers in November-December 1998. Under this measure, some 140,000 sheep were permanently removed from these commonages.  Payment of 1999 ewe premium and sheep headage grants to the farmers concerned was limited to 70% of 1998 entitlement and a maximum of 200 sheep, in the case of sheep headage. Similar provisions will apply to payment entitlements in 2000.</P>
    <P>This national interim framework plan for commonages was put in place pending the completion of detailed framework plans for individual commonages which will incorporate the main environmental measures in the agri-environment programme already agreed with the European Commission in 1998. The new measure requires that a detailed framework plan be drawn up for each commonage under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In addition, significantly enhanced payments are available under REPS for farmers with land in natural heritage areas and commonages. Work on the preparation of detailed commonage framework plans commenced in early 1999 and it is expected that a large number of plans will become available during this year. The plans are being prepared by teams consisting of agriculturists and environmentalists.  The main aim of these detailed framework plans will be to set sustainable stocking levels which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation. When the detailed commonage framework plans are completed it will be a condition of the headage and premium schemes that farmers with commonage land must be participating in an approved REPS plan or a national agri-enivronment plan to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It is expected that such cross-compliance will be put in place in year 2001.</P>

      <P>I expect the European Commission to finalise the guidelines for the new rural development Initiative, Leader+, very shortly following on the recent receipt of the observations of the European Parliament. Further consultation is taking place this week with member states and this should open the way to early approval of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader type activity in the period 2000-06. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the National Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader-type measure. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>

    <P>The report of the task force on the Integration of local government and local evelopment systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural <Col N="1391" /> partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes. Every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures. In this context, it may be possible to progress the mainstream Leader measure which will apply nationwide at a more rapid rate than Leader+ will allow. I am examining this possibility.</P>

      <P>A number of major policy developments which will frame the immediate future of the agri-food sector occurred during 1999, including: the successful conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations in March; the publication of the White Paper on Rural Development in August; and the launch of the national development plan in November.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to introduce a further buy-out scheme. The 1993 buy-out package consisted of three elements: write-off of annuities of less than £20, an option to buy-out the annuity at a discount of 50% of the outstanding capital provided any arrears were also paid, and where the buy-out was not accepted and the annuity rate was over 10%, the arrears were capitalised and added to the outstanding capital and the annual amount payable was reduced.</P>
      <P>When that package was introduced, 42,500 farmers were paying annuities, of whom 19,000 benefited from the write-off and 12,900 paid £10.3 million to avail of the buy-out concession. The number of farmers now with annuity liabilities is just over 7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the high number of these farmers who are in arrears with their annuities. Where there are genuine difficulties my Depart<Col N="1393" /> ment is prepared to be reasonable. Where it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, the arrears are capitalised and the annuity is reduced to a more reasonable level. On the other hand, if the farmer can afford to pay, the annuity will not be reduced and, in such cases, warrants are sent to the county registrar for enforcement against the farmers.</P>

The total number of livestock applications which attracted penalties under the 1998 headage and premium schemes represented 2.6% of the 522,000 applications received in that year. In the case of REPS, 2-3% of applicants would have attracted penalties of 20% of aid. Therefore this issue has to be kept in proportion and in context.</P>
      <P>Some two-thirds of penalties applied under the headage and premium schemes were attributable to late submission of aid applications by farmers. A further number arose because of a shortfall in the number of eligible animals found by my Department in the course of on-farm inspections.</P>
      <P>The number of applications which attracted a one or two year penalty, that is, false declaration, intentionally or through serious negligence, represented no more than 0.1% of applications in the 1998 scheme year. The vast bulk of these applied in the sheep sector. A one year penalty would apply in cases where, for example, a proportion of ewes for which applications was made, were found not to be ewes at inspection. A two year penalty would apply where, for example, a farmer made application for premium/headage on sheep which he did not have at the time of application or at time of inspection.</P>
      <P>In general, where an applicant makes an error in the completion of an application form, my Department allows an opportunity to correct such errors. The most common error in recent years has been the incorrect transcription of tag numbers on application forms. The level of such errors has, however, greatly decreased in the past year following the more widespread use of new information technology in the processing of the special beef premium scheme whereby farmers are no longer required to list the individual eartag number of all animals for which application is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the overall value of these direct payments to farmers and the fact that that value is <Col N="1394" /> set to increase following the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, it is inevitable that the European Commission will wish to ensure that reasonable levels of controls are in place in the various member states. </P>
    <P>Since January 1999, greater emphasis has been placed on the need for farmers to fully respect the regulatory requirements for the identification and registration of bovine animals. These requirements are particularly important in the context of traceability and the national beef assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the need to simplify the application and processing arrangements for the various direct payment schemes and to ensure that penalties are kept to a minimum.  In the course of the negotiations on the detailed rules for implementing the Agenda 2000 changes and in the discussions on changes to the integrated administration and control regulations, my Department raised the question of simplification and proportionality of penalties. Some success was achieved in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am committed under the new programme for prosperity and fairness to pressing the European Commission to re-examine the penalty regime with particular reference to exclusion penalties applicable to direct payment schemes and to apply the maximum proportionality in the imposition of all penalties. I will honour that commitment.</P>

      <P>Over the past year, considerable progress has been made in the effort to perfect a mechanical beef classification system. Trials have been carried out in this country under the auspices of my Department to test the accuracy of three systems of mechanical classification equipment which use video image technology to predict the EUROP classification grid and the yield of saleable meat. The exercise showed that mechanical classification has definite potential but some further refinements are still required to improve the systems. All three systems will be subjected to a final evaluation in a live run in a meat plant in early March. Following that trial, the results will be presented to the European Commission with a view to progressing the introduction of a mechanical classification system, which will require an amendment to the EU carcass classification regulations and, therefore, by definition, the approval of the Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>For many decades past there have not been quarantine restrictions on cats and dogs travelling between the UK and Ireland. The UK intends to dispense, with effect from 2001, with its requirement for quarantine for dogs and cats entering or re-entering the UK from member states of the European Union, the European Economic Area or rabies &ndash; free islands, in favour of a regime involving microchip identification, vaccination, blood testing, and health certification. One feature of this new regime will be a requirement to present a certificate on arrival in the UK attesting to the fact that the animal has been treated for tapeworms and ticks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the UK will be introducing from the end of this month a pilot of the new regime, entitled the &ldquo;Pets Pilot Project&rdquo;, using certain approved carriers along approved routes to the UK. While I do not intend to introduce a similar pilot scheme in Ireland, the arrangements to apply here over the coming period are under active consideration.</P>

      <Quest> if she will clarify her proposals regarding the number of places on community employment schemes for 2000; the number of places to be transferred to the social economy; the employers eligible to recruit participants in the social economy; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>Based on a budget of £287 million, the targeted average participation rate on the community employment programme for 2000 is 35,520. This represents a reduction of 2,400 on the average level of participation in 1999. It is expected that the social economy programme will provide for an average of 670, full-time equivalent, places this year. The amount of funding allocated in the social economy programme, £10 million in 2000, is expected to increase to an annual level of up to £41 million as the programme becomes established. In this respect provision is made in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for up to £213 million for the social economy programme with the objective of creating employment for 2,500 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the social economy programme three types of enterprises can be funded, each of which will be able to recruit participants who meet the programmes eligibility criteria: community businesses, ultimately financed from trading income alone; deficient demand social economy enterprises, where the demand for particular goods and services within a community is not matched by resources to pay for these due to disadvantage or low density of population; enterprises based on public service contracts, where public services in disadvantaged areas and <Col N="1406" /> communities are subcontracted to local social economy enterprises.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the employers in the case of the social economy programme are the social economy enterprises.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a US based company (details supplied) based at Clonshaugh Industrial Park, Dublin 17, is due to close on 31 March 2000; if she has satisfied herself with the redundancy package for the 40 employees; the efforts, if any, she will make to ensure that the employees obtain alternative employment; the financial and other assistance given to the company by State agencies previously; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 February 2000 the managing director of the company informed his staff that the Irish operation would cease production from 31 March 2000 and that the building would be sold. The closure of the company is a result of difficult trading conditions for the parent company and for the Irish operation which has necessitated a rationalisation programme within the corporation as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to reverse the company's decision to close. The company will co-operate closely with IDA Ireland over the coming weeks to provide expert advice and assistance to all employees in seeking alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the redundancy package to the employees, I understand that redundancy terms were agreed on 16 February 2000 based on a Labour Relations Commission recommendation FÁS will make a full registering service available to all employees of the company. A complete skills <Col N="1407" /> audit can be carried out, together with a training requirement analysis. FÁS will also help identify potential job opportunities.</P>
    <P>In relation to State agencies under the aegis of my Department, I have been informed that the company has received £34,469.00 for training support scheme, TSS, grants from FÁS during the period 1991-99. IDA Ireland has paid the company grant assistance totalling £957,390. The last payment was made in 1981 and the company has no outstanding grant liability to IDA Ireland.</P>

      <Quest> if she will urgently appoint a task force, with representatives of all the relevant Departments and agencies, to come up with a strategic integrated plan and recommendations to address the south-east region's underperformance in terms of job creation; if the report will be provided within the shortest possible time frame; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities nation-wide. For this reason, it has ensured that the strategy underpinning the national development plan will be driven by a strong emphasis on attracting high value added projects and balanced regional development. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed accordingly.</P>
      <P>In the recent past a number of task forces in the south-east region have been operational and these have brought positive results to the region in job creation terms. In 1999, more than 1,200 new jobs were announced for the region. The majority of these jobs will come on stream in the next few years and will add to the growing base of employment in agency client companies.</P>
      <P>The good relationships and co-operative spirit that have been generated between the various interest groups as a result of the establishment of task forces in the area continue to impact positively on the south-east region and I am confident that it will remain so, particularly in the light of the new strategies being adopted by the industrial development agencies, which sees them targeting the needs of the different regions by identifying the industrial sectors most likely to deliver growth and quality jobs.</P>
      <P>In addition to working with their respective core client base, the agencies, because of their involvement in all aspects of business development, finance, technology, human resources etc, work closely with all development organisations in the region as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro-actively facilitate an integrated approach to development in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> In view of all of these targeted initiatives, I do not propose to establish a task force for the south-east region.</P>

      <P>From inquiries made in the redundancy payments section of my Department the position is that there is no record of a claim having been received in respect of the person concerned. It is a matter for the employer in the first instance to determine whether a valid redundancy situation exists in a company and responsibility for the payment of a statutory redundancy entitlement rests with the employer. If the employer does not pay the statutory entitlement to the employee, the employee can be paid direct from the social insurance fund and my Department thus seeks re-imbursement from the employer.</P>
      <P>The employee should contact the redundancy payments section of my Department where the officials will be able to advise him as to what steps he should take to establish his entitlement to a statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>

      <P>Community employment, CE, is a work experience programme targeted at the long-term unemployed. To be eligible to participate in CE a person must be in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows/widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months, or referred by the National Rehabilitation Board. Persons signing for credits are not eligible.</P>
      <P>Limited resources do not make it possible to provide CE for all unemployed persons. Therefore, it is essential to target the programme at those most in need. The current eligibility criteria were introduced in July 1999 following a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on CE.</P>

      <P>I can clarify for the Deputy that the holders of salmon rod and net fishing licences are entitled to vote in the forthcoming elections of <Col N="1411" /> members to the regional fisheries boards on 20 March. Under the Fisheries Act, 1980, entitlement to vote requires, among other things, that licences must be valid for the electoral year in question. However, under the new framework, elections are being held in March rather than December. Section 7 of the Fisheries Amendment Act, 1999, therefore sets 1999, in effect, as the year for which licences are deemed valid for voting purposes. This provision was made in the interests of licence holders to ensure that those who would normally purchase their licences later in any given year would not be excluded from voting in the elections on this occasion.</P>

      <P>Abdelhamid Hakkar was convicted in France in 1989 of killing a policeman and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was denied the right to representation by a lawyer of his choice and subsequently refused to attend the trial. In 1991, Mr Hakkar filed an application with the european commission for human rights alleging that France had violated the European Convention on Human Rights. In 1997, the Commission found that France had violated Article 6 of the Convention &ndash; the right to a fair trial. The Committee of Ministers of the Council endorsed this view and recommended the reopening of the case to the French authorities. To date this has not happened.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as Chairman in Office of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, regards the compliance by member states with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights as being of the utmost importance. We have urged the French authorities to reopen Mr Hakkar's case and will support whatever action is appropriate within the committee to ensure that Mr. Hakkar's right to a fair trial is upheld. The Human Rights Committee of the Committee of Ministers is at present drafting an interim resolution against France, which will be brought to the Committee of Ministers in March should no progress be forthcoming in the case of Mr. Hakkar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this issue is one that has become a matter of great public interest in France and beyond.

Ireland has noted reports of <Col N="1414" /> recent measures adopted by the French national assembly regarding the reopening of procedures in such cases. In light of this, we hope to make further progress on the issue in the Committee of Ministers by the end of March.</P>

    <P>Following consultation with representatives of the personnel of An Fóras Cosanta Áitiúil and <Col N="1416" /> An Slua Muirí, the reserve defence force representative association, RDFRA, was established in July 1992. The association represents its members in discussions with the Department of Defence on maters concerning their remuneration and certain other conditions of service. Rates of allowances, including deductions for rations, come within the scope of representation. Accordingly, this is a matter which comes within the remit of RDFRA and which can be dealt with under the representative arrangements which have been agreed with the association. The subject has been raised by the association, and at a recent meeting with officials of my Department, it was indicated to the association that the examination of the existing arrangements was nearing completion. The matter will be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-98, which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the first line reserve made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Force, An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil and An tSlua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan.  Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process, the chief of staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task.</P>
      <P>In May, 1999 the military board presented a copy of its final report to the steering group for consideration. In September 1999 when the steering group had completed its review of the reserve, including consideration of the military board report, it submitted to me a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of consideration of the draft steering group report, I do not intend to make any comment on the findings or recommendations contained n the report or on the procedures that will be necessary to implement such findings or recommendations. As I have indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>
      <P>However, as I announced recently, I have allocated an additional £1.5 million in this year's Vote for Defence towards the cost of providing extra training and courses of instruction for members of the FCA and An tSlua Muirí. The increased allocation will permit an increase in the training days form the current level of 63,000 days annually to 84,000 days approximately this year. The additional training days are regarded as an important means of facilitating the future development of the reserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development: (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of recent references in the media to the sale of beef on the bone. In contrast to the situation in the UK, where the introduction of a ban created considerable controversy, the sale of beef on the bone was never legally banned in Ireland. However, the Minister for Health and Children, while recognising that the risk to consumers was extremely low, advised as a precautionary measure, in December 1997, that beef with backbone attached should not be sold to consumers. This advice has not been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Neither my Department nor, to my knowledge, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has issued any general recommendations on consumption of beef on the bone. The UK authorities recently decided to lift the ban which had been in place in that jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Although the incidence of BSE in this country is markedly different from that in the UK and there are a number of significant differences between our respective approaches in implementing BSE controls, the question of conducting an assessment of the theoretical level of risk posed by beef on the bone in Ireland is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I expect the European Commission to finalise the guidelines for the new rural development initiative, Leader+ very shortly following on the recent receipt of the observations of the European Parliament. Further consultation is taking place this week with member states and this should open the way to early approval of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding for Leader+ will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of programmes, the report of the Task Force on the Integration of Local Government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes. Every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The position is that, following very depressed markets for sheep in the autumn of 1998 coupled with a severe shortage of fodder, I introduced the ewe supplementary measure 1998. Under this measure farmers with commonage land in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry who were not already participating in the rural environment protection scheme, were required to reduce their ewe number by some 30%. Arrangements were made with the meat factories whereby the sheep removed from the commonages were slaughtered at no expense to the farmers concerned. In addition, all of the sheep farmers with commonage land in the counties concerned were entitled to a fodder related top-up payment equal to £10 per ewe on 70% of their sheep quota. In total, fodder related payments amounting to some £5.423 million were made to 5,436 sheep farmers under this scheme. In addition, some £887,462 was paid to the meat factories that facilitated disposal of boner and condemned ewes removed from commonages.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has indicated that approval will be forthcoming for that element of the scheme which involved fodder related payments to individual farmers with commonage land. There should be no question, therefore, of farmers having to repay the money they received under this scheme. Final approval for that element of the scheme which involved payment of £887,462 to meat factories has not yet been secured. My officials are in contact with the Commission with a view to securing final approval for this particular element of the scheme.</P>

      <P>A Department official recently called to the person named to inspect the land he included in his 1999 area aid application. The inspection could not be completed as part of the land included in his area aid application was submerged by water at the time. An inspector will re-visit the above named applicant as soon as conditions allow to conclude the inspection.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the area aid unit has processed the application based on the information to hand on its electronic database. The person named claimed a total of 24.14 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 22.90 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 1.24 hectares or 5.41% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in this case, a penalty of 2.48 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 20.42 hectares. Payments have already issued based on this reduced figure, any further payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>This case can be reviewed, if necessary, following the further inspection.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, to move the EU income support system for livestock farmers away from a current headage basis towards another basis of entitlement which would reduce the requirement to hold stock numbers to qualify for payment in view of the fact beef quality may not be encouraged sufficiently by the current system.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4708/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals to change the EU income support system <Col N="1424" /> for livestock farmers from the current headage basis. In fact, the Agenda 2000 Agreement, concluded last year, has retained the per head livestock basis and it is unlikely, therefore, that this system will be changed in the near future.</P>
      <P>An area based system, which is the main alternative to a headage system, would not necessarily be advantageous to the Irish beef sector. In the first place, the headage system is well suited to Irish conditions with the result that Irish producers secure approximately 11% of the premium payments compared with our 7% share of EU beef production. My Department estimates that our share of the payments based on area would fall to approximately 8.5%. Second, in a situation where the cost of production exceeded the returns from the market, an area based system, which is not based on a requirement to keep beef animals, would result in a sharp drop in beef production. In addition, an area based system would not necessarily provide any greater incentive to improve the quality of animals in comparison with a headage system.</P>
      <P>At the same time, under the Agenda 2000 Agreement, the disadvantaged areas compensatory headage schemes will move from a livestock based system to an area based system with effect from 2001. While the details of the new area based scheme have not yet been finally agreed, the requirement to have certain levels of livestock will remain as a condition of eligibility for payment.</P>
      <P>The beef task force, which I set up to address the developmental requirements of the sector made firm recommendations in relation to quality. Some of these, which include the payment on grade rather than a flat pricing basis are already in place. Also, where there is national discretion under the EU support regime, such as in the case of expenditure from the national envelope, this instrument has aimed at encouraging quality by targeting support to beef heifer producers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the recently established Irish Cattle Breeding Federation &ndash; ICBF &ndash; in which all the organisations involved in cattle breeding improvement activities on a national basis are participating, represents a sound framework to achieve real improvement in the quality of our beef cattle. Its main objective is to ensure Irish farmers benefit to the greatest possible extent from genetic improvement in cattle. It has been provided with the necessary resources and capabilities to do this and has already made considerable progress towards establishing a suitable permanent structure for the organisation and development of the required genetic evaluation and information technology systems.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the quota regime, farmers holding suckler cow quotas of seven or less premium rights are required to use at least 90% of that quota in any one of two consecutive years, otherwise the part not used in the second year will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve. Quota leased out is regarded as quota used but quota may only be leased out for three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The person named held a suckler cow quota of seven premium rights. He applied for suckler cow premium on three cows in 1998 and on one cow in 1999 and did not lease out quota in either year. As the amount of quota used in both years is less than 90% of his permanent quota, the quota not used in the second year, that is, six premium rights has to be returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>The person named was written to on 1 February 2000 to this effect. There is no record in my Department of having received a reply to this letter.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The organic farming sector is reacting to the demands for produce produced in an environmentally friendly fashion. One of the most important inputs required for the expansion of the organic livestock sector is adequate supplies of organic cereals. I am aware that currently supplies of reasonably priced home produced organic cereals are inadequate and this is causing difficulties for organic livestock producers.</P>
      <P>Proper weed control is a prerequisite to producing good yields of quality organic cereals. The building up of soil fertility by using farmyard manure or green manure, together with the use of appropriate crop rotations are two well tried methods of reducing weed infestation in tillage crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement of soil fertility on an organic <Col N="1426" /> farm can best be achieved in an integrated crop-livestock system. I, therefore, draw the Deputy's attention to a new research project on organic milk production which commenced during 1999 at the Teagasc organic unit in Johnstown Castle, County Wexford. This new research project will also address the production of organic cereals to meet the needs for adequate supplies of organic concentrates essential for milk production.</P>
    <P>The Teagasc research centre at Oakpark is responsible for research on organic grain production. In conjunction with the organic milk production project, Teagasc Oakpark is carrying out research into systems for the production of organic cereals, including weed control, at the organic unit in Johnstown Castle. This year organic crops of winter barley, spring barley and Triticale will be sown at Johnstown Castle with a view to establishing the best systems of production.</P>

As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
    <P>In the determination of local groups for the delivery of programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on two animals under the 1999 cattle headage scheme. His entitlement was £64 but because of an overpayment of £111.44, which occurred under the same herd number under the 1989 cattle headage scheme, the grant of £64 was incorrectly recouped. I have arranged for payment of £64 to issue to him within the next 14 days.</P>

    <P>The person named applied on two animals under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme. Clause 15 of the terms and conditions governing this scheme states that an eligible suckler cow &lsquo;is a cow, that is a bovine animal that has calved at least once already'. My Department wrote to the person named on 18 August 1999 requesting dates of calving of both animals he applied on under the scheme. He contacted my Department <Col N="1429" /> by telephone on 20 August 1999 and confirmed that he was not applying for grants under this scheme. In any event, since the animals applied on were heifers, he is not eligible for payment under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>

      <P>I am generally aware of concerns on this topic. The position is that the slaughtering of calves for veal production is minimal in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of animals, including calves, at the time of slaughter is governed by the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 114 of 1995). These regulations give effect to Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993. They set out the rules for the treatment of <Col N="1431" /> animals prior to death and humane methods for the slaughter and killing of animals both within slaughterhouses and in other locations, such as farms, to ensure that animals are spared avoidable pain and suffering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current EU rules for the protection of laying hens, including those in battery cages, are set out in Council Directive 88/166/EEC, which have been transposed into national law by way of the Care and Welfare of Poultry (Laying Hens) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 238 of 1990). These regulations set out the specifications of battery cages and include a recommended code of practice for the care and welfare of laying hens in battery and other intensive systems. The regulations prescribe requirements for cage area per bird, feed troughs, cage height and floors.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers of the European Union recently adopted new rules by way of Directive 1999/74/EC providing minimum standards for the protection of laying hens in the various systems of egg production, including battery cages. The new rules will come into operation on 1 January 2003 so far as conventional battery production is concerned. This directive, which I supported during Council discussions, will significantly improve the welfare of laying hens throughout the EU and will, in particular, prohibit conventional battery cages from 2012. This deadline is generally in line with a vote of the European Parliament on battery cages and has been welcomed by animal welfare interests.</P>

Meat placed for sale on the market is derived from animals slaughtered in either export approved plants or domestic abattoirs. Meat produced in export approved plants and licensed domestic abattoirs slaughtering over 1,500 livestock annually is certified by veterinary officials of my Department. Meat produced in the smaller domestic abattoirs is certified by local authority veterinary officers.</P>
      <P>The operation of export approved plants and domestic abattoirs is governed by the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Veterinary Examination) Regulations, 1992, as amended and the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1997. Production of minced meat, meat preparations and meat products is governed by the European Communities (Meat Products and Other Products of Animal Origin) Regulations, 1995, and the European Communities (Minced Meat and Meat Preparations) Regulations, 1996.

    <P>I am concerned at the increased incidence of TB in recent years which has been matched by similar increases in Northern Ireland and in parts of Britain. I should point out however, that in overall terms some 99.5% of the country's 7.9 million cattle pass the TB test each year.</P>
    <P>As regards brucellosis, a series of measures were introduced in 1997 and 1998 to address the deteriorating position. The current regime was reviewed during 1999 by an EU Food and Veterinary Office &ndash; FVO &ndash; mission and their report broadly endorsed the measures in place and being introduced. While it is too early to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the new measures, as their contribution will not become apparent for at least another calving cycle, already there are some signs that the position is improving. For example, the number of laboratory positive blood tests fell from 6,417 in 1998 to 4,545 last year, while the number of net restricted herds at 31 December 1999, restricted under EU legislation, was 228 compared with 383 at the end of the previous year.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it has been agreed that measures will be adopted with the objective of reducing current levels of TB by 50% and of making significant progress towards eradicating brucellosis within the next four years. These measures will be finalised with the farming and veterinary bodies in the context of the Animal Health Forum.</P>

      <P>I expect the European Commission to finalise the guidelines for the new rural development initiative, Leader+, very shortly following on the recent receipt of the observations of the European Parliament. <Col N="1434" /> Further consultation is taking place this week with member states and this should open the way to early approval of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan.

      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader+ type rural development programmes. Every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures.</P>
      <P>In this context, it may be possible to progress the mainstream Leader measure which will apply nationwide at a more rapid rate then Leader+ will allow. I am examining this possibility.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that vehicles brought into the State from within the European Union are not subject to Revenue controls or checks at the point of entry into the State. There is, however, an obligation to register any vehicle which is intended to be kept permanently in the State, except in the case of distributors or dealers who are specially authorised to hold unregistered vehicles pending sale.</P>
      <P>The majority of used vehicles declared for registration are subject to some form of examination when they are declared for registration. The level of examination depends on the type of vehicle, the basis on which vehicle registration tax &ndash; VRT &ndash; is charged and the circumstances in which the vehicle is being registered. Such examinations focus on the responsibilities laid to the Revenue Commissioners, that is, the registration of vehicles and the collection of VRT. In the case of agricultural tractors, examinations are carried out on a selective basis only. The Deputy will appreciate that considerable inconvenience would be caused to farmers and machinery dealers alike if each and every used tractor was required to be transported to a vehicle registration office for physical examination prior to registration. Generally speaking, the particulars declared in relation to such vehicles are accepted at face value at the time of registration, unless the official concerned has reason to doubt the veracity of the particulars declared or the bona fides of the transaction. The process of registration does not in itself provide total validation of the bona fides of any vehicle and the onus is on the particular purchaser at all times to apply the natural caution warranted in any serious financial transaction. The question of compensation does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>Information is received by the Revenue Commissioners from time to time with regard to stolen vehicles and is immediately circulated to all vehicle registration offices. No such information was received in this instance. Consequently, at the time the vehicles in question were declared for registration, there was no reason to suspect any irregularity. The declarations were accepted at face value and the vehicles were registered without examination. It has since been learned that these vehicles have been impounded by the Garda as part of an ongoing investigation into the sale in the State of a substantial number of tractors which have been stolen in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The State does not have profits as such but the Deputy may be referring to the change in the difference between the income and expenditure of the Exchequer in the past five years, which has moved from being in deficit to being in surplus. <Col N="1439" /> It is true that depending on the measure taken the Government's finances have improved by a greater extent than the increase in the Exchequer pay and pensions Bill. However, I am not clear on the inference that the Deputy can take from this.</P>
      <P>The main factor influencing the increase in the pay bill over the past five years has been increases in the pay rates of public servants. I assume the Deputy is not suggesting that public servants should have received increases in excess of the terms agreed between the social partners in the successive national programmes. Apart from any other considerations, this would inevitably have had an impact on private sector earnings and damaged our national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In addition, I do not share the Deputy's apparent equanimity about the rate of increase in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill over the past few years. We are inevitably facing some fall-off in the extraordinary high rates of economic growth that this country has experienced in recent years and annual increases in the pay bill of the order of 9% and 10% are simply not sustainable in that context.</P>
      <P>Our membership of EMU, and the lack of national discretion in relation to exchange rate and interest rate changes, highlights the importance of public expenditure and taxation as elements of economic policy. In order to meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is essential to maintain control over public expenditure, of which public service pay constitutes a significant part. Prudent economic and budgetary policy has delivered major benefits to all of us and the Government is determined to ensure that this will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>Nor am I clear what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to high earners and low earners. Developments in the pay of public servants at all levels are governed by the pay agreements which form part of successive national programmes. I think what is important in this area is the need to respect the terms of those agreements and to ensure that wage increase are such as to maintain our competitiveness. However, the Deputy may wish to note that the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a package of measures &ndash; including measures in relation to pay, a statutory minimum wage, taxation and PRSI &ndash; which is specifically designed to address the particular position of the low paid.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the increase in cases of food poisoning from 448 to 1,235 between 1997 and 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, a number of categories of food poisoning are statutorily notifiable by medical practitioners to the health boards. The health boards in turn make weekly returns of infectious disease notifications to my Department. The figures quoted by the Deputy refer specifically to the increase in food poisoning, bacterial other than salmonella.</P>
      <P>Both globally and in Ireland there has been a trend towards an increase in the reporting of cases of food poisoning. The reasons for the increase in the number of reported cases of the condition referred to by the Deputy may be attributed to several factors, and I would like to outline some of those. First, with improved food-borne disease surveillance being carried out by the health boards, in co-operation with the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the figures are likely to increase in coming years rather than decrease. This is a trend not only for Ireland but is the case for many other countries. In this regard I am informed that the number of cases of food poisoning, bacterial other than salmonella, for the year 1999 is reported provisionally at 1,666. Second, we have seen over the past few years an increase in the reporting of food-borne illness because of increased consumer awareness. Consumers are now more aware of food-borne disease because of the educational consumer focused campaigns carried out by public health departments of the health boards, the food unit and the health promotion unit of my Department, and by the FSAI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, we have seen an enormous increase in the market for convenience foods associated with a change in lifestyle of Irish consumers. More and more people are eating out, which has resulted in <Col N="1441" /> the rapid expansion of fast food outlets. Some staff working in this area are untrained and inexperienced in food hygiene practices. The FSAI has informed my Department that food poisoning outbreaks in 1998 were associated mainly with catering establishments such as restaurants, hotels or institutions. The FSAI has indicated that in its opinion most of these outbreaks were easily preventable, having arisen mainly from inappropriate storage, inadequate heating and/or cross-contamination. It has produced a guide for takeaway premises because of the relatively high risk associated with such premises. While the responsibility for good food hygiene practices rests firmly on the owners of these food businesses it is imperative that employees know the causes of food poisoning and what they must do to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The FSAI, which has been in existence on a non-statutory basis since 1997, was formally established by the Government in January 1999. This honours the commitment contained in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium that an independent, science based statutory agency with responsibility for food safety be set up. In July last year the FSAI took over responsibility for the enforcement of all food safety legislation which, prior to that date, had been the responsibility of a range of State agencies. The primary function of the FSAI is to ensure that food produced or marketed in Ireland meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The FSAI also has a statutory function to foster at all stages of food production, from primary production through to final use by the consumer, the establishment and maintenance of high standards of food hygiene and safety.</P>
    <P>The FSAI is not solely concerned with the compliance of food safety legislation and it places great emphasis on the creation of a culture of food safety in Ireland. In this regard, we must be conscious that the responsibility for food safety lies at all levels, producer, retailer and consumer. By assuming our responsibility, while it may not be possible to completely prevent food poisoning, we can all help to minimise its occurrence.</P>

      <P>The provision of BCG vaccination is a matter for individual health boards in the first instance. I have made inquiries of the Southern Health Board and the board has indicated that routine neonatal BCG vaccination was discontinued in much of the greater Cork area in 1972 and that routine BCG vaccination continues to be given to school-children in west Cork and to babies in Kerry.</P>
      <P>In its report, published in 1996, the working party on tuberculosis recommended that, in the absence of neonatal BCG, alternative control measures must be strengthened. The Southern Health Board has indicated that rigorous control measures are being addressed in its area, in particular, the use of directly observed therapy to improve compliance with treatment in instances where this might be indicated.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the 1996 report, the national tuberculosis committee was established to oversee its implementation. It continues to keep under review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</P>

    <P>Orthodontic services are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. An additional £1.45 million was made available to health boards in their financial determinations for the year 2000 specifically for the development of their orthodontic services under the plan.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is in the process of developing a second regional orthodontic unit on the campus of St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown. This unit is targeted for completion in May 2000. My Department has also approved a proposal from the Eastern Health Board for a third regional orthodontic unit to be situated on the campus of Beaumont Hospital. The Eastern Health Board proposes to advertise shortly through the Local Appointments Commission for the recruitment of an additional two consultant orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board has recently opened a new orthodontic unit in Navan and also proposes to develop an orthodontic unit in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>I am also considering proposals for the introduction of a grade of orthodontic specialist in the health board services. The introduction of this grade should have a significant effect on treatment waiting lists.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a charter of rights for hospital patients was introduced in August 1992. It provides guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals, including maternity hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis, its objective is to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of the individual patient and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>The development of mechanisms for improvements in patient advocacy is an important task for my Department and in this regard, my objective is to provide a patient focused service, within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality of care, based on clinical need.

      <P>The most recent survey of nursing vacancies, carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; related to the position at the end of September 1999. It found that the reported number of vacancies in gross terms was 1,180.46 whole time equivalents. When overtime and the use of agency nurses are taken into account, the net figure is 428.18 wte. As in previous studies, the results again confirm that there is not a nation-wide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals and the level of vacancies fluctuate accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another. This is illustrated by a telephone survey of five major voluntary hospitals in Dublin which was carried out by my Department within the past few days, and which found that the position in three, Beaumont, the Mater and St. James's, had improved while the position in Tallaght and St. Vincent's, Elm Park had disimproved.</P>

      <P>Following the receipt of information in 1997 and 1998 from Glaxo Wellcome concerning the lot numbers produced from batch 3741 Trivax vaccine, the vaccine batch at issue in the Kenneth Best case, my Department wrote to the health boards asking them to examine their records to see if the extent of usage of these lots in the 1968-70 period could be established.</P>
      <P>Final responses have now been received from all of the health boards. The responses indicate that the use of vaccine from two of the lots in question was recorded in respect of 296 persons in four health board areas. The records in other boards were either unavailable or did not contain any of the relevant lot numbers. It should be noted that the period in question pre-dated the establishment of the regional health boards. The boards in whose areas such usage was recorded were the Mid-Western Health Board, the North Western Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been <Col N="1450" /> no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The category of nurse referred to by the Deputy is not one of the categories included in the Department's annual personnel census. Consequently, the Department does not have records of the number or location of such nurses. It is a matter for each individual health agency as to how nursing staff are deployed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that the Commission on Nursing has recommended the establishment of a three-step clinical career path in nursing and midwifery, as follows: registered nurse/midwife, clinical nurse or midwife specialist, equivalent to ward sister level and advanced nurse or midwife practitioner, equivalent to middle nursing and midwifery management level.</P>
      <P>As a necessary prerequisite to the introduction of the clinical career pathway, the Commission on Nursing also recommended that a National Council for Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery be established. This new council was established on 30 November 1999 and it is currently involved in the preparation of guidelines for the recognition of clinical nurse and midwife specialist posts. It is likely that nurses working as specialists in the area of diabetes nursing will be recognised as clinical nurse specialists.</P>

      <P>The staffing returns made by health agencies in the health service personnel census each year only identify numbers within a particular grade. The identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department is a matter for the management of each health agency. Therefore, it is not possible to identify the number of dieticians working in any particular discipline.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of their work, dieticians are involved in an interdisciplinary capacity with many different specialities within the health service. The composition of these teams depends on the particular needs of the service being provided by the agency concerned and the response which the agencies management and professionals consider appropriate, having taken the circumstances presented to them into account.</P>
      <P>I can provide the number of dieticians, dietician, senior dietician, principal I dietician and principal II dietician by heath board area, both full-time, wholetime equivalences, excluding career breaks, and part-time employed on 31 December 1998, the latest date for which complete information is available.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 to 221, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of health related support services for children and young adults with autism is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Significant additional funding has been allocated in recent years for the development of both autism specific services and those for persons with an intellectual disability who may also have autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to approximately £5 million has been allocated since 1998 to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and outreach services for children of school going age with autism. These services are provided by <Col N="1454" /> multi-disciplinary support teams and include the provision of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, psychological and social work support services. The multidisciplinary teams work closely with the parents and families of children with autism to address their needs. While practices in relation to liaison arrangements may vary from board to board, the identification of a key worker for individual children is one of the most commonly used liaison methods.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational services for children with special needs, including those with autism, is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. In recent years there has been a significant expansion of these services and my Department, in conjunction with the health boards, has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science to provide health related support services to school going children with autism. Both Departments will continue to work together to address the needs of these children.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board &ndash; NRB &ndash; is not directly involved in the provision of training services. It has, however, responsibility for the administration of the EU Human Resources Development Operational Programme &ndash; HRDOP &ndash; 1994-99 within which the bulk of training for persons with disabilities has occurred in recent years.</P>
    <P>In March 1999 approximately £70,000 was made available to support a two year pilot training programme, at foundation level, for young adults with Asperger's syndrome. The course is currently under way and the experience gained will assist in determining decisions on future courses.</P>
    <P>In addition there are three projects currently under way and funded under the horizon employment initiative for young adults with autism entitled ASPIRE, TASK and STARR. Funding totalling just under £645,000 has been made available to support these initiatives. Persons with autism would also have participated in other training programmes for persons with intellectual disabilities in particular within the HRDOP over the period in question.</P>
    <P>Persons with autism have also benefited from the overall development of services to persons with an intellectual disability, including enhanced access to residential, day and respite services. In the period 1997 to 1999 approximately 1,000 new day places have been created. This broad range of new services would include additional training, sheltered and other employment support services. However, separate information on the specific proportion of the funding spent on new day services for persons with autism is not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
    <P>Information on autism, including research and publications, is available from a wide variety of sources, including the Irish Society for Autism, health boards, voluntary agencies providing services to persons with an intellectual disability and <Col N="1455" /> autism and parent support groups. Some health boards have produced directories of the services available in their region to persons with disabilities, including those with autism, which provide both practical information on services and contact persons-numbers relevant to the various disabilities. I would suggest that these publications, which are available from the directors/co-ordinators of disability services in the relevant health boards, would provide an initial starting point for families seeking information on services.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider the addition of haemochromatosis to the list of conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme in view of the cost of drugs associated with this condition and the difficulties which this causes for sufferers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5250/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to haemochromatosis and I understand that the treatment of this condition is often hospital based. The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes melitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the new scheme is to bring about improvements over previous <Col N="1456" /> schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current national air quality standards for suspended particulates, measured as black smoke, are set out in the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Air Quality Standards) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 244 of 1987). As reported in the most recently available 1997 Environmental Protection <Col N="1459" /> Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; annual air quality monitoring report, concentrations of smoke were very low during the 1997-98 annual period at all monitoring sites in the country, including six monitors in Cork city, and were very much in compliance with current standards.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to recent monitoring undertaken by one of the EPA's mobile monitoring units, in the Blackpool area of Cork city. This monitoring is being conducted as part of the agency's statutory duty under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment And Management) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 33 of 1999) to undertake a preliminary national assessment of the levels of certain pollutants, including suspended particulate matter, for example PM10. There are currently no mandatory national air quality standards for PM10 and EU Directive 1999/30/EC for the first time specifies limit values for this parameter, based on monitoring over the calendar year. The directive is to be transposed into Irish law by July 2001.</P>
      <P>I understand the available monitoring data for Blackpool ran for less than two weeks as part of an ongoing longer sampling period. While PM10 levels on certain days exceeded the concentration level in the new EU standard for the protection of human health, the data so far are insufficient to determine whether the overall standard may be approached or breached, as it provides for up to 35 days in the year above the specified level.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the new EU limit values for PM10 will be challenging, particularly in heavily trafficked urban areas. A number of policies and measures which will facilitate meeting the new standards have already been implemented. These include the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in Cork city since 1995; more recently the introduction of new fuel standards from 1 January 2000 including cleaner diesel, a recognised source of PM10; improved standards for new vehicles; the introduction of the national car test; local traffic management strategies and significant investment in transport infrastructure such as the Jack Lynch tunnel, the Blackpool bypass and the southern ring road to ease traffic congestion and the build up of vehicle emissions in the city. I am committed to ensuring that, in addition to existing measures, any further measures that may be required will be put in place to comply with the new EU air quality standards. Such measures will be guided over time by the results of the preliminary national assessment being undertaken currently by the EPA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 235 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, empowers prescribed road authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers, including telecommunications operators, and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption. Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the Dublin local authorities and the county boroughs of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway were prescribed as authorities which may exercise these powers. <Col N="1462" /> These local authorities have powers to co-ordinate and control road openings by both public and private utilities to minimise the frequency and duration of road openings; to co-ordinate works to minimise traffic congestion and hazard to road users; and to ensure that roads are permanently reinstated as quickly as possible. The majority of road openings by statutory undertakers occur in the areas of these authorities but the question of prescribing additional local authorities is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Road openings in areas other than those prescribed in the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, are governed by section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993, which allows roads authorities to give written consent to road openings. A road authority may attach conditions to the consent.</P>
    <P>Any conditions, restrictions or requirements which a road authority may attach to a permission for a road opening, under the Roads Act, 1993, or the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, are a matter for that authority.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes to enhance local authority powers by obliging telecommunications operators to obtain the consent of the local authority before opening a road to lay underground telecommunications infrastructure. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority would be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions, including reduction in the number of telecommunications related road openings by ensuring that road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively reviewed some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term: the priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing present excessive levels of speeding by 50%. Such downward revisions could address lower speed limits, <Col N="1463" /> such as 20 miles per hour, in urban built-up areas. The situation will continue to be monitored in line with this approach.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to provide for the payment of carer's allowance to carers who are qualified for other social welfare benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. The purpose of the carer's allowance is to provide a means-tested income support payment to those who are caring full-time and who are on low incomes.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The review noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. As indicated, the practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which he or she is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the review proposed the introduction of a non-means tested &lsquo;continual care' payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitle<Col N="1466" /> ment, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the &lsquo;continual care' payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. A working group, chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children and comprising membership from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards has been set up to examine the feasibility of introducing such a needs assessment approach.</P>
    <P>One of the key priorities identified in the Government's review of An Action Programme for the Millennium is to establish a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care to be operated by the health boards. This area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a continual care payment will be examined further following the outcome of this pilot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of one-parent family payment is to provide income support on a means-tested basis to any separated or unmarried parent rearing a child without the adequate support of a partner. The scheme regulations specify that an applicant parent must have at least one qualified child residing with him or her and have the main care and charge of that child. Equal joint custody situations, such as those of the person concerned, are not covered under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation of equal shared custody arrangements within the social welfare system is a difficult and complex issue. Any solution proposed must strike a reasonable balance between <Col N="1467" /> acknowledging the value of ongoing contact and care between all parents and their children, while maintaining the integrity of existing social welfare schemes and avoiding excessive scheme costs.</P>
    <P>Recognising that joint custody arrangements are becoming increasingly common, particularly with the growing emphasis on mediated settlements between separating couples, a departmental working group was established to examine all of the issues relating to joint custody and the social welfare system, and to consider the possible options with regard to accommodating such arrangements within the system. The findings of this group are now being examined as part of a general review of the one-parent family payment which is being undertaken under the Department's expenditure review programme. This review is currently in progress and it is intended to have it completed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The person concerned signed for unemployment assistance for one day only on 12 April 1999. Her one-parent family payment ceased on 20 April last following the granting of joint equal custody for her child. She has been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and rent allowance since then. If she feels that she satisfies the conditions as to availability for work and is genuinely seeking work, it is open to her to apply for unemployment assistance at the nearest local office of this Department.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded invalidity pension on 17 June 1993. The principal qualifying condition for receipt of invalidity pension is that the claimant must be considered to be permanently incapable of work and one of the rules which must be observed by a person in receipt of invalidity pension is that they do not to engage in work.</P>
      <P>An exemption from this rule may be obtained where the employment is of a rehabilitative nature and with prior written permission of my Department.</P>
      <P>An exemption was granted to the person concerned with effect from 25 January 1996 to participate in a training course. A further exemption was granted on 24 March 1997 to work as an information officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This exemption was recently reviewed and, based on all the facts including the advice of the Department's chief medical adviser, it is considered that any rehabilitative benefit from the <Col N="1468" /> work involved as being attained. Additionally, the medical evidence provided by the person's doctor did not contain any new information on his condition. The granting or refusal of an exemption is not a deciding officer function and, as such, not appealable to the social welfare appeals office. However, where a person is dissatisfied with the outcome in relation to an exemption the case is examined by another officer to ensure that the decision is reasonable. This was done in this case.</P>
    <P>A working group has recently been established within my Department to review the current operation of exemptions from the rules of behaviour. The group will make recommendations on any appropriate amendments including the question as to whether such exemptions should be subject to the decision and appeals machinery.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides assistance to people who have little or no income and is administered on my behalf by the health boards. In addition to a basic payment people may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, e.g. rent or mortgage interest payments, or a payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation governing SWA provides that it shall be a condition of any claimant's entitlement <Col N="1470" /> to a rent supplement that the health board is satisfied that the claimant is in need of accommodation. It was in this context that the guidance to which the Deputy refers was sought by health board officials in relation to claims for rent supplement from people who had been placed in full board accommodation.</P>
    <P>In general, a person who is in full board accommodation does not have an accommodation need and would not be entitled to a rent supplement or deposit. However, the guidance which was issued makes it clear that there will be instances where, in the view of the health board, full-board accommodation is not appropriate. In those circumstances, deposits and rent supplements are paid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the communication itself, my Department's officials are in daily contact with the health boards by telephone, e-mail and letter on a range of matters relating to the operation of the SWA scheme. It would not be practical for me to approve all communications in advance and for that reason, I was not aware of the response to this particular inquiry before it issued. However, I am satisfied that the approach taken is fair and reasonable.</P>

      <P>Funding is available from the Department towards the cost of staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in disadvantaged areas under the community development programme &ndash; CDP &ndash; and the family and community services resource centre programme.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000 my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for the expansion of the community development programme. The regional support agencies funded under this programme undertook research to identify these 30 areas and also identified areas for expansion of the Department's family and community services resource centre programme. The research carried out in 1998 by the regional support agency for the north-west region, identified Ballymote as an area for future targeting and for pre-development work.</P>
      <P>Following on from this research the regional support agency commenced work in the Ballymote area with a view to establishing a family and community services resource centre in that area and this work will be ongoing in the coming months.</P>
      <P>In order to participate in the Department's programmes groups are required to prepare a work plan setting out their aims and objectives for a three year period. As this proposal would also detail the budget required to implement the work plan it is not possible in advance of considering such a detailed work plan to indicate what level of funding may be made available to a centre in this area.</P>
      <P>However, when the pre-development work has been undertaken and a satisfactory work plan has been agreed with my Department an appropriate level of funding will be allocated to support this development.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, continued to operate the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for this scheme in my Department's estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>I propose to have advertised the scheme in both the national and provincial press by mid-March, at which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding.</P>

      <P>Recipients of the one-parent family payment &ndash; OFP &ndash; which includes some widows and widowers with dependent children, are allowed to earn up to £115.38 per week without their payment being affected. Accordingly, lone parents participating on community employment schemes &ndash; CE &ndash; receive their OFP in addition to their CE earnings. The earnings disregard applying to the OFP means test is designed to recognise the additional costs and difficulties which a lone parent may face in moving into employment or training and to ensure that the financial implications of making such a move are straightforward and easily understood by them.</P>
      <P>A widow or widower who does not have dependent children and is receiving a widow/er's non-contributory pension will, like many other social welfare recipients, relinquish entitlement to their social welfare payment for the duration of their participation on a CE scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CE allowance will, in effect, be paid in lieu of their pension entitlement. Such people may, subject to the qualifying conditions still being satisfied, return to widow/er's non-contributory <Col N="1473" /> pension on cessation of their participation on a CE scheme.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of widow/er's non-contributory pension who takes up a CE scheme will, like other participants, retain, subject to certain terms and conditions, any secondary benefits that were in payment prior to participation on the scheme. In the case of rent and mortgage supplement, the maximum amount of the supplement that may be retained is £250 per month. However, as announced in the recent budget this limit will be abolished with effect from 6 April 2000 and the supplement will be tapered out over four years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> I am mindful of the implications for new construction projects as well as for the archaeological profession as a result of this temporary disruption in service. The backlog has arisen from the sheer increase in licensed excavations taking place directly as a result of the upsurge in building and infrastructure development and its resultant impact on the archaeological heritage. I have taken measures to redeploy staff to deal with this backlog. In addition, my Department has advertised for additional archaeologists and is in the process of recruiting these at present. I will continue to monitor the situation carefully to ensure that difficulties are addressed. I am hopeful that normal service will be resumed by the end of the month.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous answer to Parliamentary Question No. 211 of 2 February 2000.</P>
      <P>As previously stated the waiting times for an appointment in the law centre in Newbridge, County Kildare, have reduced in the last few months from a figure of 22.5 months in May 1999 to a figure of 15 months on 31 December 1999. However, it is still considered that this period is excessive and the matter is being kept under continual review.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to combat the problems being experienced in relation to waiting times, I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 2000 when I increased the allocation of grant-in-aid to £12.899 million, an increase of 9% on the 1999 allocation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board is proceeding with the setting up of a nationwide private practitioners panel to provide legal services in domestic violence, maintenance and custody-access issues in the District Court. Advertisements were placed in the papers recently inviting private practitioners to put their names on a panel for this purpose and it is anticipated that the panel will be established in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that while provisional Garda crime statistics for 1999 have not yet been formally published on a divisional basis by the Garda authorities, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the national figure is 81,500 approximately indictable offences, which represents a 5% decrease over the previous year.</P>
      <P>As the Garda crime statistics are provisional I cannot comment on specific issues, though I can assure the Deputy that never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, never in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those guilty of serious offences serve their sentences.</P>

      <P>The position is that subject to a few exemptions as provided for in the firearms Acts, 1925 to 1998, a person may not hold a firearm which is defined in section 4 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 unless such possession is authorised by a firearm certificate granted in accordance with the provisions of the Acts. These exemptions include possession by members of gun clubs, persons taking part in production of films and possession of firearms which have been disabled where possession is authorised by the local superintendent.</P>
      <P>The policy regarding the licensing of firearms is that, in line with a Government decisions in 1972, the gardaí adopted a policy of licensing only sporting firearms, shotguns having barrels of not less than 24 inches in length, unrifled air guns and rifled firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches. Crossbows which were classed as firearms in 1990 are also licensed. A further Government decision in 1993 relaxed this policy to allow the licensing of bolt action rifles of a calibre up to .270 for the purposes of deer hunting and target shooting only. The policy of not licensing any other firearms also extends to defective firearms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restrictions imposed by the firearms Acts do not apply to any antique firearm which is sold, bought, carried or possessed as a curiosity or ornament. Generally, firearms manufactured before the mid 19th century which do not utilise <Col N="1484" /> modern type ammunition would be classed as antique firearms.</P>
    <P>To facilitate film production it is practice to authorise the possession of firearms which would not normally be authorised. Most of these firearms have been modified to render them incapable of discharging live ammunition. My Department grants importation licences for such firearms subject to the condition that when the production is completed these firearms are exported.</P>

      <P>Under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and regulations, applicants for legal services are required to satisfy a test of financial eligibility. The present eligibility limit is £7,350 per annum disposable income. Disposable income is the income that remains after certain statutory allowances have been granted.</P>
      <P>A mortgage allowance up to a maximum of £3,802 and loan interest payment allowance up to a maximum of £602 can be granted. A mortgage allowance relates to mortgage payments made by the applicant on the house in which the applicant normally resides. This allowance cannot be granted in respect of a loan other than a mortgage. Loan interest allowance relates to the amount of interest, which is paid by the applicant on foot of a loan, other than a mortgage, or hire purchase agreement.

A tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent Management Board for Product Development, and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, culminated, in June 1998, in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, to go forward for grant-aid to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's docklands.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in St. Peter and Paul's national school declined from 457 in September 1998 to 448 in September 1999. Under the existing schedule the number of pupils required to retain the 16th assistant teacher for the 2000-2001 school year is 450. However, the staffing schedule for primary schools for the 2000-2001 school year has not yet been finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Department of Education and Science representation on the local drugs task forces has been under consideration in my Department for some time.</P>
      <P>I am aware that education issues and, in particular, tackling educational disadvantage and early school leaving, are of concern in many drugs task force areas. These core issues, which have been well documented by the ESRI and other agencies as key factors affecting the life chances of disadvantaged communities, are also of concern to the 38 area based partnerships operating under the local and urban development programme. Tackling educational disadvantage has also emerged as a critical issue in the four pilot integrated services process areas, which correspond to a number of local drugs task force areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is already represented on the education and training sub-committees of each area based partnership by a Department inspec<Col N="1495" /> tor or psychologist. In addition, my Department has provided resources for the appointment of full-time and part-time education co-ordinators to support the work of partnerships in addressing educational disadvantage and preventing early school leaving. Virtually all of these partnerships correspond to the local drugs task force areas. Notwithstanding the aims and objectives of the partnerships and the local drugs task forces the educational issues for both agencies are essentially the same and the obvious way to address these issues is, in my view, for the local drugs task forces, the education and training sub-committees of the relevant partnerships and the four pilot integrated services process areas to establish linkages and contacts at local level.</P>
    <P>In this context my Department has had discussions with Area Development Management Limited about nominating the partnership education co-ordinators as my Department's representatives on the local drugs task forces. ADM has advised that the education co-ordinators are very well placed to undertake this role and that it would provide a useful co-ordination at local level between partnerships and local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently written to Area Development Management Limited confirming its intention to proceed with the nomination of the education co-ordinators as its representatives on the local drugs task forces and requesting that the partnerships and the education co-ordinators be informed in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this arrangement will give the local drugs task forces a specific forum in which education issues of concern to them can be addressed. Such close links between these agencies would also ensure the best use of State resources flowing into the targeted communities.</P>

      <P>I am aware that schools in certain areas of the country are experiencing difficulty in obtaining qualified primary teachers at present. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures has been introduced to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total intake in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. Bachelor of Education graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. An audit of schools for this purpose has not been organised in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> Since September 1998 all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale, AMI, College, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, Montessori who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years duration which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The RPII recently issued results to the schools that participated in the first phase of the survey. This phase covered schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I have directed my Department to take immediate steps to appoint consultants to devise remediation programmes for schools showing levels in excess of the national reference level, with priority being given to the cases of greatest need.</P>
      <P>A total of 175 schools, spread across these counties, showed radon levels in excess of the national reference level with 13 schools showing levels that require immediate mitigation. A consultant has already been engaged to advise in relation to this task. Five schools have been inspected by the consultant who is preparing a remediation programme for each. This is expected to be ready shortly. The remaining eight of these 13 schools will be inspected by the consultant in early March.</P>
      <P>Remediation programmes for the remaining less-affected schools will be drawn up, with priority being given to the areas of greatest need, following the appointment of a consultant. In this regard it is necessary that the contract for the appointment of an expert to advise on mitigation in the remaining schools requiring attention be advertised in the EU Journal in compliance with public procurement procedures. It is anticipated that an expert will be appointed in the near future.</P>
      <P>All schools have received information on radon and will be kept informed of new developments.</P>
      <P>My Department will meet the cost of mitigation.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. Computer equipment and software are items that may be provided. Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual student.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department provided a grant for computer equipment for this student to her primary school. The student, however, has since transferred to a post-primary school.</P>
      <P>My officials have been in touch with the school authorities of the post-primary school to ensure the school is fully informed about the scheme and to advise the school that it may submit an application on behalf of the student. My Department will process an application from the school without delay.</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that students are experiencing difficulties in finding good affordable accommodation. This difficulty is a subset of the general housing shortage which has been growing in recent years and is particularly acute in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act. These incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage, rather than an across the board increase in grant levels which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>
      <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003 the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the programme for prosperity and fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>

      <P>Under the New Deal &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity it is intended that all primary schools, including the schools referred to by the Deputies, will be surveyed to identify the precise distribution of disadvantaged pupils across the system. My Department is currently finalising arrangements for this survey, including the criteria which will be applied in identifying the levels of disadvantage in individual schools. It is intended that the survey will be carried out during the current school term.</P>
      <P>In response to the levels of disadvantage identified through the survey, additional supports will be made available to schools to meet the needs of their pupils. The level and nature of the support services made available will vary depending on the level of need identified.</P>

      <P>In November 1998 my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of children with autism. As a result of this decision, children with autism now have an entitlement to special dedicated education services at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Since this decision was taken, a total of 50 special classes catering exclusively for children with autism have been established, including four such classes in the Kildare area. Children attending these latter facilities also have access to the outreach support services provided by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are currently in discussion with school authorities in the Kildare area with a view to establishing further special classes for children with autism from the area. As part of this process, every effort is made to avail of existing accommodation in schools in the area.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department's inspectorate to investigate the particular case raised by the Deputy with a view to ensuring that suitable educational provision is made available as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 323 together.</P>
      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of special educational support services.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of children with autism. As a result of this decision, children with autism now have an entitlement to special dedicated provision at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Such provision may take the form of special classes attached to ordinary primary schools or special dedicated classes in special schools. All such classes also have child care assistant support and the children in question attract a special increased rate of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>As a result of this initiative, a total of 50 special classes catering exclusively for children with autism have been established and further classes will be established as required.</P>
      <P>Children with autism can also be catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools, with the support of the resource teacher service. Arising from a Government decision in October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with autism, now have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs. Already, as a result of this initiative, the number of resource teachers catering for such children has increased from 104 to 329 and the number of child care assistants has grown from 299 to 937. The process of allocating additional resources to cater for these children, including children with autism, is continuing.</P>
      <P>Children with autism may also require the support of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other therapeutic services. Such services are provided by the relevant health board and my Department works in close co-operation with these services to ensure the provision of these necessary supports.</P>
      <P>The range of special educational support services provided for children with autism are available to children from the age of four to 18 years.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 300 children with autism are being catered for in special dedicated facilities at present. Information on the total number of children with autism within the education system in the present school year is not readily available to my Department.</P>
