      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Ó Caoláin. I call on Deputy Ó Caoláin to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, that is, the need for the Minister for Health and Children to intervene with urgency to ensure the provision of the promised review for promoted grades of psychiatric nurses in October 2000 with moneys to flow in 2001 in order to avert the imminent strike by the Psychiatric Nurses Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 42<i>a</i>, Statements on Transport Policy; No. 43, Gas (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 44, Sex Offenders Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 3, Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>

    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the proceedings on No. 42<i>a</i>, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening statement by the Minister for Public Enterprise and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes; (iii) <Col N="662" /> Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; (2) any division demanded today on No. 43, No. 44 or No. 3 shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Wednesday, 7 June 2000; and (3) the Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 June 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now entering the month of June, the last month of the sitting until late in the year. Where stands the programme of work that the Government undertook when the Taoiseach met the other party leaders to discuss issues concerning corruption in public life, including anti-corruption legislation, the Government's promised ethics and standards in public office legislation, the registration of lobbyists, the protection of whistleblowers and other allied legislation? When will the Government outline its programme of work in these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the standards in public office Bill will be published this session. There are nine other matters. As the Deputy is aware when we met a few weeks ago I outlined what I thought was a reasonable strategy, that we would establish an all-party committee which would work throughout the summer to try to reach agreement and bring these matters to a conclusion to enable us to either amend the standards in public office Bill in the autumn or bring forward whatever legislation is deemed necessary. It is the Deputy's party's position that it is prepared to co-operate and participate in the committee if everybody else is prepared to do likewise. I appreciate and accept this. I have been in correspondence with the leader of the Labour Party. I do not want to give the details, which are confidential, but it is his publicly stated position that if I do not give a decision in advance the party will not participate in the all-party committee. The decision it wants me to give in advance is that I accept the principle that corporate funding <Col N="663" /> should be banned. I do not accept it. It would be against the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation as outlined by the Taoiseach what is the Government's plan for legislation dealing with corruption, whistleblowers, lobbyists and related matters? Will it indicate its programme of work? If, as the Taoiseach wished, the all-party committee had been functioning, the Government would have had to produce such a programme by now. What is its programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Labour Party awaited the Taoiseach's response to the letter from its leader, to enable it to involve itself with enthusiasm in the work of an all-party committee, it needed the principles established first. It is surprising that the Taoiseach has chosen to respond to the correspondence on the Order of Business rather than in writing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the ethics programme, will the Taoiseach, in the absence of an all-party committee, accept the whistleblowers Bill, the anti-corruption legislation and the electoral amendment Bill published by the Labour Party which will be deemed to have passed Second Stage at the end of December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to correspondence between myself and the leader of the Labour Party. I am referring to the issues raised by Deputy Quinn during the Private Members' debate. We are continuing to correspond on those issues.</P>
      <P>There are Bills from the Labour Party, the Government and Fine Gael. If we are serious about dealing with the issues on an all-party basis we could do so. I will make another attempt to try to get the Labour Party to come on board. We all have a role to play if we are serious about good legislation. If we just want to set preconditions not to enter into things then that is all right.</P>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach is thumbing the Constitution, would he refer to the sections that deal with education? The former Minister for Education and Children, Deputy Martin, gave a commitment in January that there would be an appeal mechanism for children and parents of children with special needs who are not getting the services they require. In other words, they could appeal their cases without going to court. This commitment is not in the legislative programme. What has happened to this commitment?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to tell the House about the proposals for the institutional and regulatory reform of public transport and the important changes that will take place to improve public transport in the coming years. I thank Deputies Stagg and Yates for putting forward the idea that time be allocated to debate the issue.</P>
      <P>It is my firm intention that the proposed institutional and regulatory changes will be implemented in a spirit of partnership in full consultation with the social partners. To begin this process, I will consult the social partners on the proposed framework through the Public Transport Partnership Forum being established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The first meeting of the forum will take place on 9 June.</P>
      <P>It is widely acknowledged that public transport in Ireland has suffered from serious under-investment in years gone by. For a long time we were enthralled by the prospect of the private car and treated public transport as the poor relation when it came to investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the contribution made by CIE and its subsidiary companies over the years. Man<Col N="670" /> agement and staff have often had to work through very difficult times, dealing with the consequences of under-investment.</P>
    <P>The most recent institutional change in public transport was the establishment of Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann as subsidiaries of CIE at the start of 1987. My Department is still regulating the private bus sector under an Act that dates back to 1932. That date speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999, provided the first tentative evidence of a major change in policy towards increased investment in public transport. However, the main impetus for a change of policy in favour of public transport has been the urgent need to deal with the traffic congestion problems in Dublin and to forestall similar problems in our other major urban areas. There is also a strong awareness of the need to improve railway safety, to reduce transport-related pollution and to address the social inclusion of people in rural areas and people with mobility impairments.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 provides for a major acceleration of investment in public transport and, for the first time, commits the Exchequer to very substantial capital expenditure on bus and rail. While this enormous £2.2 billion investment is essential and welcome, it alone will not transform our public transport services. We must also consider institutional and regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>The sheer scale of the investment required, by itself, makes it essential that we review our institutional and regulatory structures. This raises two potential constraints, the availability of finance and the availability of sufficient management skills for the new infrastructure and to operate the services subsequently in a safe, cost effective and customer friendly way. Thankfully, the availability of finance is now less of a constraint than it was in the past. However, resources are not unlimited and we will look to public private partnerships as a way of providing some of the funding as well as bringing in specialist skills and innovation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's traditional approach to such an investment and development challenge was to establish a State company &ndash; the ESB and Bord Gáis are obvious examples. However, this policy approach reflected a belief at the time that the private sector was not in a position to mobilise the necessary finance and the management skills to take on large projects. That is clearly not the case now because as Ireland's economy has grown, so also has the capacity of the private sector to contribute to major infrastructural development. Furthermore, our membership of the EU brings with it access to similar capabilities in other member states, coupled with their existing experience of building and operating the sorts of projects we are now contemplating.</P>
    <P>Another change that has taken root over the years has been our preference for competition rather than monopoly supply of goods and ser<Col N="671" /> vices. Many activities, such as air travel and telecommunications, that we previously assumed could be carried out successfully only on a monopoly basis have been shown to improve very substantially when exposed to competition.</P>
    <P>Closely coupled with competition is the issue of independent regulation. It is an essential part of creating a level playing field and facilitating the development of market sectors. The need for funds and additional management skills, examining the capability developed in the private sector, the wider experience in other EU countries and the benefits of competition and independent regulation are factors that influenced this review of the institutional and regulatory approach to public transport.</P>
    <P>The first institutional change for the public transport sector was outlined in the announcement last December that I would establish an independent body to oversee railway safety. Up to now the regulation of safety has been a matter for the Department. However, in the review of railway safety in 1998 the independent consultants recommended that our railway safety legislation should be updated to reflect current trends and practice. The Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, which deals with matters related to the Department, has been to the fore in pressing for that railway safety legislation. My Department has been working on the preparation of new legislation and I will have the heads of the Bill detailed in a consultation paper before the end of June.</P>
    <P>In deciding to establish an independent railway inspectorate, I am going further than the minimum recommendation of the railway safety consultants because I am satisfied that such an important issue should be dealt with on an independent basis, removing any perception of a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>Recently I submitted two policy papers to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships, entitled A New Institutional Framework for Public Transport and Regulation of the Bus Market in the Greater Dublin Area. Both papers are in the public domain, on the Department's website and were issued to all Members of the Dáil and Seanad. I look forward to hearing the views of Members of this House on both papers today and in the future.</P>
    <P>I intend to seek Government approval shortly for publication of a composite policy paper based on those two submissions. I will also consult the social partners, beginning tomorrow week, on the proposed framework and we will work through all the proposals in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The papers set out a policy framework or direction. Much painstaking work will be required to flesh out the details of those reforms and I have no doubt there will be lengthy discussions on those details. Those papers clearly signpost the future direction of policy. The job which now faces the Depart<Col N="672" /> ment is to develop the details in consultation with the social partners and to see them through to implementation.</P>
    <P>In framing my proposals for new institutional arrangements, I had in mind three overall objectives which should underpin our public transport policy. These are: to ensure the provision of a well functioning, integrated public transport system which enhances competitiveness, sustains economic progress and contributes to social cohesion; to ensure the provision of a defined standard of public transport, at reasonable cost to the customer and the taxpayer; and to ensure the timely and cost effective delivery of the accelerated investment in infrastructure and facilities necessary to ensure improved public transport provision.</P>
    <P>The definition of an appropriate standard of public transport provision has historically been the responsibility of CIE, having regard to the resources available to it. CIE has been given an annual revenue subvention by the State and the company has from time to time been given financial targets to achieve. However, the Government has not ever explicitly defined what the standard of public transport provision should be.</P>
    <P>In recent years the city of Dublin has changed beyond recognition. It was once a much smaller, compact city. The suburbs of Dublin now spread into the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath and even beyond. Likewise, many other cities and towns are growing rapidly. The challenge of getting people from A to B is all the greater and requires a new approach. Commuting by car within our cities is no longer a sustainable option, in terms of congestion, effective use of limited road space and environmental damage. If people who have traditionally used their cars to commute to work are to be coaxed onto public transport, we must provide the service demanded by commuters.</P>
    <P>I propose that the State should, on behalf of the people, broadly define what standard of public transport services it wishes to see provided having regard to the needs of public transport users and the financial capacity of the Exchequer. As a first step, the DTO proposals for a future transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area, which are being finalised and will be published later this year, can provide the basis for defining an appropriate standard of public transport provision for the capital city. I suggest the State should then put in place the necessary legislative, regulatory and institutional measures to procure that standard of public transport service as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>However, while the State has a responsibility to ensure that the defined standard of public transport provision is procured in an effective way, it does not need to be directly involved in the provision of those services through State owned companies. Instead, I propose that the public transport market should be opened up to private participation, as a way of better exposing it to market forces, improving its quality and <Col N="673" /> efficiency and increasing attention to customer requirements.</P>
    <P>I propose a number of institutional changes to the present public transport set-up. These are: the establishment of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann as separate, independent companies, with the freedom to operate transport services in each other's current area of business; the transfer to private ownership of one of these companies, probably Bus Átha Cliath; the division of Iarnród Éireann into two separate State owned companies, one responsible for railway infrastructure and the other for the operation of railway services; the possible dissolution of the CIE holding company; the establishment of a separate independent body with the function of procuring major infrastructural projects on a public private partnership basis; and the establishment of an independent public transport regulatory function.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath are large public transport companies with extensive experience of providing scheduled services. These companies will obviously be significant players in any new public transport market. However, they cannot compete for business in each other's territory as both are owned by one company &ndash; CIE &ndash; and because they are directly prevented from doing so under the Transport (Re-organisation of CIÉ) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>Giving them their legal and commercial independence from CIE and introducing amending legislation to remove the artificial restriction on their area of operations is not enough to allow them compete effectively. Common State ownership would lead to conflicts of interest and impede their ability to be fully effective in a competitive bus market. I have proposed that the State divest itself of at least one of these companies.</P>
    <P>The future regulatory framework for the Dublin market has been broadly defined, while the regulatory environment for the inter-city and rural transport market will be considered at a later stage of the review. As the future regulation of the Dublin market is clearer, I propose that Bus Átha Cliath is the logical first choice for private ownership.</P>
    <P>The third of my proposed institutional changes, separating the railway infrastructure from the provision of services, will have a number of advantages. It will allow both infrastructure operations to concentrate on their respective responsibilities and is in line with best practice in Europe. It is also consistent with EU requirements to eliminate conflicts of interest where competing operators may wish to use the railway. While that may seem a remote possibility for mainline rail services in Ireland, the public private partnership development of new commuter rail services means there is a real prospect that Iarnród Éireann will no longer be the only train operator at some time in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>As regards my fourth proposal, I see the light rail project office as providing the nucleus of the body whose function will be to procure major <Col N="674" /> infrastructural projects on a public private partnership basis. The light rail project office will need to be suitably expanded and restructured to take on this enhanced role.</P>
    <P>The independent public transport regulatory function would have a number of functions in relation to bus and rail, including: regulation of the bus market, through franchising and licensing as appropriate; allocation of State financial support for public transport services, through public service contracts; and other market regulation responsibilities arising from public private partnerships and EU legislation.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet committee will address the future institutional arrangements for transport in Dublin later this year. This review will address public transport, roads and traffic and possibly the interaction of land use and transport. That is why I have spoken about a regulatory function rather than a body. It is possible that in Dublin the regulatory function could be part of the mandate of a body with a wider range of functions. I would welcome the views of Members on this issue.</P>
    <P>The paper on bus regulation is the outcome of a review of the 1932 Act, requested by Government last November, with a view to introducing competition in bus transport in the Dublin area. A public consultation process was initiated and 39 written submissions were received. These submissions came from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Follow-up meetings were held in recent months with key stakeholders to further explore their views. As part of this review, the Department carried out extensive research and visited three European capitals, Helsinki, Stockholm and London, to view at first hand how those cities had tackled the challenge of providing an efficient public transport service and to hear from those involved the lessons to be learned.</P>
    <P>There was a strong consensus from both the consultation and study visits on two issues. First, competition resulted in a significant reduction in cost. Second, competition should be used to choose which operator should provide services on a particular route or group of routes. Where several operators have been permitted to compete on individual routes on a fully deregulated basis, bus usage and the reliability of service have declined significantly. This view was generally shared by the people and organisations making submissions to the Department.</P>
    <P>While competition can be expected to reduce the cost of providing bus services, I am conscious of the need to increase the quantity of services in Dublin as quickly as possible. This is likely to require a substantial increase in the level of State revenue support for necessary but uneconomic services even if those services are franchised on a competitive basis. No matter what steps are taken, recipients of free travel will continue to have free travel. Any contract or franchise given out will carry that element within it and the cash that goes with it. However, my proposal to award franchises on a contractual basis, specifying the payments to be made for a defined quantity and <Col N="675" /> quality of service, will ensure that the best value for money is obtained.</P>
    <P>I am not under any illusions as to the scale of institutional and regulatory changes proposed and the length of time it will take to implement them. These proposals will take a number of years to implement fully. A number of Bills will be necessary in addition to those already being prepared in the areas of railway safety and light rail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. I have been very critical of the Government for not having a transport policy. In so far as it now has a series of policies relating to bus competition and institutional reform, I very much welcome that. I have exhorted the Minister to move in this direction. Given that she has moved, I support the thrust to modernise public transport and, in that regard, she has my good will. This will be an arduous road needing absolute political determination.</P>
      <P>In the nature of things, the Dáil has a political cycle, and we are in the latter half of the lifetime of this Dáil and of this Government. It concerns me that it would be very easy for all this to go off track in many respects. It will require serious dedication and commitment not only from the Minister but the entire Government to make this happen.</P>
      <P>My biggest concern relates to the understanding of the gravity of the problem of Dublin traffic gridlock. The inevitability of it getting much worse is utterly predictable. An extra 1,000 cars are being registered every week in Dublin. On average, there are 250,000 commuting journeys per day in the Dublin area, which is set to rise to 450,000 over the next decade. This means that during the morning and evening peaks, from 7.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. and from 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m., speed will be reduced from an average 14 kph to 8 kph, which is a brisk walking pace. This is certain to happen because of lack of progress over the past three to five years, and it will impact negatively on the growth of Dublin and on the quality of life. It is very frustrating. I attended a meeting this week with IBEC to which they brought their top people from Brussels. I left the meeting seriously dismayed.</P>
      <P>There are four aspects to solving this problem. The first is infrastructure, investments and projects; the second is competition; the third is administrative structures; and the fourth is the question of CIE and the semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> In regard to the most urgent aspect, increasing capacity, which involves everything from Luas to public transport development, to the eastern relief route, port tunnel and so on, and modernising the whole Dublin area, I am now told that the Community Support Framework Funds have not yet been approved by the Commission and that the plan envisages that annual spending will go from £2.4 billion to £6 billion or £7 billion per year. I am told that most of the projects will not now be in the Official Journal for tender by the end of this year and that, therefore, the whole proposal to front-load the national development plan will not now happen as it has to be appraised by various committees in Brussels and we are well behind schedule. The entire plan is in jeopardy. This relates not just to the Department of Public Enterprise but to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is in danger of being pushed beyond 2006 and that it will not happen because we are already so far behind. We had the fudge of the £500 million contingency fund plus public private partnership schemes for the Navan link, the airport link and the Luas tunnel. Where is the PPPS to make that happen? I will come back to that. Since then the Minister has flirted with the Mitsui proposal to go underground from Ranelagh to Blanchardstown; CIE has published an Ove Arup report to go underground to the Spencer Dock; and the Dublin Transportation Office has presented to the Cabinet sub-committee a mega metro underground plan. Every plan we have is superimposed by a new plan that is even bigger than the previous one, but none of the previous plans is being implemented. Not even the 11 quality bus corridors have been completed. I welcome the extra buses and the few extra DART rail cars, but in the lifetime of this Government the only extra thing that will be provided, other than the extra buses, is the two Luas lines with the city centre modification to which the last Government was committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the best that can happen. My biggest concern is that this project is not being implemented and delivered on the ground. I just cannot exhort the Minister strongly enough to move fast to establish a separate independent body with the function of procuring major infrastructural projects on a public private partnership basis. If the Minister introduces emergency legislation we will support it. What I heard about the Department in relation to the PPPS unit &ndash; and this is not a political point &ndash; is that it is the worst of all the Departments, relative to the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This is what IBEC found. We cannot have such a body quickly enough to get going and build this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My biggest concern relates to the projects and project implementation. My first concern about the Government's proposals on bus competition <Col N="677" /> and the paper on institutional reform is the status of these papers. If those proposals were included in a Government White Paper on transport and we knew the Government was committed to introducing legislation in relation to them and could ask about them on the Order of Business, we would have something real on which to proceed. However, my understanding is that these are discussion documents in so far as the Taoiseach has not confirmed that this is Government policy. It is being discussed by a sub-committee of the Cabinet. We need clarification as to the status of these papers before we can tease them out. While they represent progress in the area of institutional reform of bus competition they do not have the endorsement of Government approval and legislative commitment.</P>
    <P>I understand the need for a transport forum. The Minister will decry me for being anti-democratic, but I shudder when I think of the taxi forum. The taxi forum was a basis for a lovely cosy consensus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. If this is anything like the taxi forum, it will be a disaster, because in that case everyone went out happy and two years later nothing has been done &ndash; we have no more taxi plates now than we had then. Let us not have a forum, or a plan like the viability plan for CIE, that moves at the pace of the slowest snail and is then scrapped. I am for consultation. If the Minister can persuade someone, she should do it, but the forum should not be a basis for kicking everything to touch so that when the Taoiseach is asked about the privatisation of Dublin Bus he can say it is a matter for the forum. The Minister can sell this every which way. She can say great progress is being made, but that the forum is there. Let the forum not be an excuse for lack of progress.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed in principle to the privatisation of Dublin Bus. However, the Minister is biting off more than she can chew by proceeding with the privatisation of Dublin Bus at the same time as she is introducing a new regulatory and competitive framework. Competition should come first. That is the most urgent aspect. The structures should be reformed and a proper Dublin transport authority established to implement policy rather than analyse it. Those are the two most important aspects. If the Minister superimposes on that a major industrial relations row about CIE, legislation disbanding CIE, competition and privatisation, she is biting off more than she can chew and she will be ambushed in the industrial relations debate. Competition should come first and privatisation afterwards. The Minister has kindly invited suggestions on the wider range of functions of the Dublin regulatory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year Fine Gael published a White Paper on Dublin transport. I have a clear view of what is required to make things happen in the <Col N="678" /> greater Dublin area. A Dublin area transport authority must be established with a 15 member board to which the Minister would nominate eight members and each of the local authorities would nominate one. It would be responsible for the implementation of the project I mentioned earlier and would have CPO powers for bus depots. It would provide park and ride facilities to make QBCs more attractive. It would meet the local authorities, set targets for public transport and be responsible for them.</P>
    <P>At present no-one is to blame for traffic gridlock. It is not the fault of the Minister but that of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is not Eoin Keegan's fault as there are so many local authorities outside his jurisdiction, it is the fault of CIE. It is not responsible for the subvention. We have operation free flow. We have gone around in circles with 13 different bodies involved. Someone must be the Dublin traffic supremo and be accountable. The same applies to taxis. A proper structure must be set up to licence bus competition. New quality standards must be put in place.</P>
    <P>The 1986 legislation was not all bad. The Minister's job should be to set policy and standards and give money to the authority who should then get on with the job. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would divest themselves of their transport functions and give them to that body. There would be a Minister for Transport who would be responsible for it. I am putting my cards face up on the table.</P>
    <P>As regards bus competition I note the Department's study. I regret it did not look at the system in Copenhagen which has worked superbly. I favour the implementation of such a system. The HT group which is the equivalent of the Dublin transport authority set up a sub-committee on bus competition. Relating it to our case, it took 100 core Dublin Bus routes and divided them into tranches of five. Each year for five years they put 20% of them out to tender on seven year contracts. Dublin Bus and other operators could compete. If Dublin Bus did not win the contract it could put extra buses on the remaining 80% of the services. There would be a massive increase in bus capacity which is a problem at present. The subvention would have to be doubled from its present £16 million. There would be a level playing pitch as regards complying with standards, regulations and so on. It would be done by way of public service contract. I appreciate the Attorney General's advice but the lack of public service contracts has prevented competition. We have transparency and know that a given route in Finglas or Stillorgan can be costed as to what is economic and viable and how many extra buses would make it non-viable. A subsidy could be applied or it could be tendered out. New feeder and radial routes could be put in place. There would be standards and an inspectorate. This has been done in Copenhagen which, with its population of 1.7 million, is not dissimilar to Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> These problems have been resolved elsewhere. I agree with the Minister the experience is that the cost of the service decreases and its quality and reliability improves. As the contracts are for seven years there is secure employment for everyone concerned. This is not intended to get at anyone, it is focusing on delivery. Have I much more time?</P>

      <P>Operation freeflow should operate throughout the year. Something needs to be done urgently as regards park and ride facilities. The DTO should be given responsibility to provide such facilities adjacent to QBCs. Perhaps it could be provided for in next year's budget that if someone purchases a travel card, be it a rail card, an integrated ticket, Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann card, for £500 per year they would get a tax credit. We need imaginative schemes to encourage people to use public transport and leave their cars at home.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister a fair wind with this. I believe it will be another Minister who will make it happen but in so far as we can accelerate this I have goodwill towards it. However, I warn the Minister that there is slippage on the national development plan and there is much uncertainty about the public transport project delivery that requires urgent attention.</P>

The last time we addressed these issues substantively, if I recall correctly, was last November. The sad fact is that we will probably have many more statements before we get clarity or an idea from the Minister as to what she intends for public transport.</P>
      <P>The Government has been in office for three years, three wasted years. We got 50 buses, a few carriages and a train.</P>

      <P>At a time when unprecedented resources are at the Government's disposal, it has shown neither the energy nor the political will to undo the historical and damaging underfunding of our public transport system. It is in vogue now.</P>
      <P>When the Government is eventually removed from office, its failure to radically address the crisis in public transport, not just in Dublin although the problem there is particularly acute, will be one of the reasons. It is time to return to the basics that the Government appears to have forgotten. People work for many reasons. Some enjoy it, some revel in it but most people work because it enables them to do other things like raising families or enjoying active social lives. They do not enjoy spending up to an additional five hours a week commuting to and from work. As one commentator put it recently, it is the equivalent of working on a Saturday morning and they are not particularly enamoured of a Government that cares so little about their plight. They know that there is no real solution to Dublin's traffic problem based on the motor car. Perhaps some of them think it is critical for other people to use public transport but not them. However, they know that traffic congestion is costing much money. Indeed in a society where the needs of the economy are valued more significantly than the needs of people, we hear this argument a lot.</P>
      <P>However, as I have stated on other occasions, it is only one side of the coin. In a more rounded society we would be hearing as much and more about the implications of traffic congestion for our environment and health. Maeve Ann Wren is to be congratulated on putting the case so cogently in her recent series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>. Nobody should be arguing the case more for public transport than the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Our commitments at Kyoto to marginally increase our CO2 emissions by 2010 stands, like many of our international commitments, in tatters. The Minister's abatement strategy has yet to see the light of day but it is difficult to see how he could envisage any realistic attempt to meet targets that do not involve a reduction in our dependence on the motor car. I read during the week that the regime to be introduced post-Kyoto will be far more punishing and vigorous. The sad reality is that Ireland is already gearing itself up to miss those targets too.</P>
      <P>On the health side, families are dealing with its effects on a daily basis. The increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among our young, is well documented and needs no further elaboration. Suffice to say that it cannot be allowed continue. The case for public transport is well established and is unarguable. That it has merited no substantive response from the Government beggars belief. The reality is that this is a Government unprepared to take the tough decisions necessary to resolve this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the national development plan. As far as public transport goes, there is no radical plan. For instance, there <Col N="681" /> are no new rail lines of any substance. The Government made a virtue of its commitment to the BMW region but has singularly failed to provide it with a rail link, not just to Dublin, but inside its own borders. Donegal, like Britain of old, remains in splendid isolation.</P>
    <P>The £1.5 billion figure allocated begrudgingly by the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Public Enterprise for Dublin is but a drop in the ocean, given the level of investment required. To invest, a plan is needed but the Government has failed to produce a spatial plan for the country as a whole and has also ducked the issue for Dublin. Mr. Frank McDonald may feel he has an idea of what is being discussed by the Government in these regularly reported half daily sessions, but Dubliners have long given up hope that this Government will provide their city with a modern and efficient rail-based system. The underground-overground debate about the Luas, for instance, has long since given way to an overwhelming &ldquo;up in the air and going nowhere&rdquo; sentiment that abounds among the public.</P>
    <P>The final nail in the coffin of the grand public transport vision for Dublin is that the Taoiseach is now becoming personally involved in the deliberations of the Cabinet sub-committee. As the Taoiseach is not known for making and taking decisions, I fear this issue, which affects the quality of life of all Dubliners, will take a back seat to more important projects such as building Stadium Ireland in Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>I have spent some time addressing matters the Government has failed to do, but I would like to turn now to things the Government has done. A decision was made some months ago to increase fares on Dublin Bus. The mind-boggling stupidity of this decision is hard to fathom. Public policy should have one focus &ndash; getting people onto public transport. No impediment should be allowed in the pursuit of that policy which is critical to Dublin's well being. If new rolling stock in required it should be purchased immediately, not as part of a national development plan &ndash; the implementation of which is already behind schedule &ndash; to which it has little relevance. The idea that the Minister would increase fares in the current circumstances is sheer lunacy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in thrall to a group of people who believe the only thing wrong with public transport in Dublin is its structure. The same people, few if any of whom probably use public transport, believe the system is merely inefficient, not underfunded. The same people's unquestioning belief in their own economic models has caused them to forget one simple fact of life they should have learnt as children. At its most basic, that lesson is that one does not get silk purses from sows' ears. Or, alternatively, &ldquo;what you put in, you get out&rdquo;. These two concepts are readily understandable to children but are seemingly beyond the comprehension of many of our well remunerated so-called economists. The reality of the matter is that we put in very little. No other public transport system in Europe receives as <Col N="682" /> little State support. The begrudging intervention for Dublin Bus is without comparison in Europe in terms of its meanness. Is the concept that &ldquo;you get what you pay for&rdquo; too difficult for some people to understand?</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann could probably be made more efficient. However, if people seriously believe addressing that issue, or the introduction of competition on certain routes &ndash; a move my party supports &ndash; will solve an historic funding deficit, they are dafter than I thought. It is always useful to have whipping boys to blame for one's own faults, but in this case it cuts no ice. This should be a debate about volumes not structures.</P>
    <P>The Minister and her acolytes' view of public transport remains locked into the 1980s, an era in which we were unable to afford to properly subvent our public transport system. We pressurised all our State companies to rely on ever smaller investment and to break even in a fashion that not one single public transport company in Europe was asked to do. The real surprise is not that the service does not measure up to that available in other European cities, but that the State companies were able to operate under such conditions.</P>
    <P>If the truth were told, it would be admitted that the need for subvention in a low density city like Dublin is even greater that in higher density cities. Rather than address this issue by substantially increasing funding for public transport, including Dublin Bus, the Minister has chosen to take another route. Instead of investment we are being asked to buy into further structural reforms. We and the workers at these companies are being asked to buy into the mantra of privatisation as a real option by a Minister from whom the public, rightly or wrongly, would not buy a used car. Make no mistake about it, there will be no IPO for Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>In effect, the Minister's response to Dublin's transport crisis is to change a public monopoly &ndash; Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann &ndash; into private and, most probably, foreign monopolies. Competition will take time. I note that the main Opposition Party also supports that position. The participation of my party in any Government with either of the main parties in the House will ensure that type of policy will not be tolerated or accepted. It will not be implemented if we are in office.</P>
    <P>The Minister is deluding herself and makes great play of the fact that she has no political advisers, but I have never come across a Minister who needs them more. This plan for public transport is a fraud on the people of Ireland and, in particular, on those in Dublin. It is no substitute for real investment in a service that the capital city requires and that, for the first time in the history of our nation, we can afford.</P>
    <P>The Government has effectively abandoned any rail-based solution to Dublin's traffic problems. Any system that emerges from that decision will be the property of future generations and that is why investment in our bus companies is <Col N="683" /> so important. Whether we like it or not they will continue to do the lion's share of public transport work in the capital. That is why the recent proposals published by the Government are so dangerous. At best they represent an utter and total distraction from the real job of work at hand. They portray a Minister with no comprehension of, and certainly no sense of urgency about, the real task. They portray a Government in the hands of right-wing ideologues who view our public transport system as a guinea-pig on which to test out their latest theories.</P>
    <P>The losers will be the public and the Minister. If an example of privatisation of public transport is needed one need go no further than our nearest neighbour, Britain, where the effects can be seen. The day of reckoning will come for this Government which has failed on three major fronts &ndash; public transport is in a mess, housing policy is also in a mess, and people continue to die while waiting for basic health care. That is an unacceptable scandal. The Progressive Democrats may be able to live with this but God help members of Fianna Fáil when the public meet them on the doorsteps at election time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in what she has outlined in her statement on public transport policy. Having listened to contributions from the Opposition benches, it is almost as if they were locked in a time-warp. While I listened carefully I did not hear anything innovative from them. The Fine Gael representatives said they were willing to go along with the Minister, but they also said she is doing nothing about transport. Deputy Stagg spoke about the past, non-co-operation and public-private partnerships, but he does not understand what is going on. I also listened to many statements about Dublin's transport system, as if there were no problems in other parts of the country. While I admit that it is a modern, dynamic and vibrant capital city, Dublin's public transport service does not live up to that image. The Minister's proposals for future transport policy do measure up to that image, but they will not be achieved overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Past Governments, comprising many other political parties, were confronted with the same problem but sat on their hands and did nothing. They did not even consult people or discuss the matter. I do not know how Opposition speakers can live in the past as if the problems are associated only with Dublin. There are transport problems in the regions also, including towns and cities far from the capital. The national development plan clearly spells out how much money will be invested for specific operations in each region. Contrary to what has been said in the debate, private companies &ndash; J. J. Kavanagh and Sons of Urlingford, in my constituency, is but one &ndash; are delivering a national service of exceptionally good quality. Those companies are responding to the marketplace, understanding their market, driven by an ambition to be com<Col N="684" /> panies of excellence in the field of operational transport and successful nationally. If private companies could do that, why could the main operators in the field during those years not have achieved the same level of operation? I can only assume that because we pumped so much money into them, they did not bother.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Government to ensure that what it intends to do in the regions is done on the basis of a public private partnership. The companies operating successfully should be given the opportunity to lock into Government policy and perhaps access some of the existing funds to extend their own operations and deliver the service. If that service is delivered on the bus routes throughout the country, there will be fewer cars clogging up the centre of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know the number of rural TDs who can take a bus or a train to Dublin, do their business during the week and go home at their leisure using that transport. I cannot do that because the buses and trains leave at irregular times &ndash; I am talking about Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann &ndash; and I cannot get home at the right time. Those companies are not responding to the market. If I went by private transport I could almost do it, so who is responding to the market first? It is the private operator. If we want to take cars out of Dublin we should do it by way of public private partnership. The bus routes and the companies are there. I am asking the Minister and the Government to reach out, in the context of investment, and assist those companies to grow and develop. Let us make use of the success stories like J. J. Kavanagh and Sons of Urlingford.</P>
    <P>In relation to Iarnród Éireann, a number of pathetic statements and investments have been made in terms of the national development plan for the regions. I will not accept that Kilkenny city should not have a commuter service. Twelve months ago I asked the officials of Iarnród Éireann, at a meeting of the Oireachtas committee on European affairs, when that service would be delivered to Kilkenny and they told me &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. That was 12 months ago. In my book &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; is a week or two weeks. It is immediately. The market is demanding that it should happen, but it has not happened. Someone should light a fire under the executives of that company to ensure they deliver the service to the regions in a far more speedy fashion than they have done up to now. Doing that would reduce the number of cars travelling in and out of the capital city.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Government's policy on decentralisation, I understand more than 92 applications have been made. As soon as that decentralised &ldquo;train&rdquo; begins to move out of the offices in Dublin, there will be further demand on public transport in the regional cities and towns. The Minister will appreciate my saying that, in spite of the recent argument with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Kilkenny is a city and it should be included among the major cities in this region for development. Various Government statements refer to <Col N="685" /> growth centres and cities but they exclude Kilkenny. When I was elected to this House I said that Kilkenny and Carlow were like Brigadoon &ndash; they came at election time and vanished soon after. I would like to think my tenure in this House will ensure that they stay long after election time. I ask the Government to recognise the fact that Kilkenny is a city which deserves investment and a better rail and bus service. We have a decentralised Government office and I have no doubt we would have far greater success in terms of developing our decentralised status if there was a better service in and out of the city.</P>
    <P>The towns along the routes into Kilkenny and the stations there need further investment. Kilkenny Corporation designated the Kilkenny station as part of the integrated action plan. Part of that station is now to be sold and developed. I welcome that, as a member of the sub-group of Kilkenny Corporation. Will the Minister speed up that development so that as well as a commuter service we will have a modern bus and rail station and that the other rail stations in the region &ndash; I am not being totally parochial &ndash; will be modernised? We should encourage the general population to use the public transport system with confidence because it works. It works in many countries around the world and all we have to do is examine those models and adapt them to this country. For a rail system to operate, this must be the best and easiest model to put in place.</P>
    <P>We have consulted on this matter, and there is no better Minister to listen and take on board the views of people, particularly those from rural Ireland, and deal with them efficiently and properly. In the context of the national plan, I would ask that places like Kilkenny and Carlow should not be forgotten and that the services be brought up to date as quickly as possible because demand will follow the announcement on decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I refer to the quality of the carriages currently in use. Anyone responding to the marketplace would constantly upgrade the type of carriage in operation. They would be aware of the standard they wished to achieve. We all talk about the 9002 quality standard and listening to the customers, but I do not believe they listen to their customers. The train from Kilkenny to Dublin is full on a regular basis. The carriages are ancient and uncomfortable. The service offered is certainly friendly but the quality of the service is not what it should be. I did not think we would have to ask the Minister to ensure upgrading of carriages. I would have thought the company would respond on a regular basis. Surely it is not so inexperienced as a company operator that it has to constantly come back to the Minister. Surely it has its own plan of action. It should respond to what is happening in the marketplace just as the private operators respond to it, but does not. That is the reason we continue to debate the issue in this House.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with the plan but I ask her to take into consideration the successful <Col N="686" /> private operators in rural Ireland who are making things happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the documents submitted recently to the Cabinet on infrastructure and development but I cannot help coming to the view that if statements and comment were to be of any real benefit, we would have the best, most modern and comprehensive transport system in the world. In the past three years, no topic has been more talked about and reported upon. We have had committees, sub-committees, quangos, reviews, consultants and consultants to consultants, and now we are to have a transport forum. The output at the end of all of that, in terms of concrete decisions or real action on any of the projects, has been zero &ndash; a few buses and a few rail carriages.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Yates, said about the slippage on all projects as well as the failure to make firm decisions on future projects. We have been loaded down with plans. We have had proposal after proposal from various groups and yet no concrete decisions have been made. Every week in the papers we read about a new transport plan. Frank McDonald in <i>The Irish Times</i> was beside himself with excitement publishing maps of trains going hither and thither. However, it was all just a puff of smoke as not a single part of the plan was adopted.</P>
      <P>Three years ago Fine Gael published a traffic document entitled &ldquo;Capital Crisis&rdquo;, in which we identified the two priority issues as the need for an integrating regulatory body for Dublin transport and the importance of bus competition in the short and long term. I rejoice in the fact, now that the first Government documents on public transport have been published, that maybe somebody in the Government was listening to us. I emphasise, however, the status of those documents. They are reports which outline options for future decisions, although they were reported in the media as if the decisions had been made and all we had to do was wait for the trains and buses to start rolling any day now.</P>
      <P>The Minister has invited comment. I want to comment on the document on institutional framework recommendations. First, while I recognise the need for a national regulatory authority, the first priority should be the Dublin region. Second, it should not be answerable to the Department of Public Enterprise, which has been the dead hand on transport and has left us in this mess. That is no reflection on the Minister, her predecessors or the many good people in the Department but it is an historic fact. If the promised privatisation of buses, trains and so on takes place, what will be left that is public and why should it come under the Department of Public Enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major flaw in this proposal is that it fails to take the opportunity to amalgamate all the traffic functions, which flows from the previous point. The last thing Dublin needs is another body dealing with transport. It has been bedevilled by a plethora of agencies dealing with the various <Col N="687" /> aspects of traffic, roads, transport and so on. Any solution must immediately address that inbuilt inefficiency.</P>
    <P>Any successful urban transport system in Europe is based on the city or the region. We should adopt a similar approach to Dublin transport, based on the local authorities which make up the greater Dublin area, and which are accountable to the people of Dublin in a way which the structure the Minister is talking about could never be. The root of the inertia problem that has bedevilled public transport has been the dispersal of responsibility over a variety of agencies. We need a single autonomous body with statutory powers, which would embrace the structures and functions of the DTO, the director of traffic, the traffic management, roads and land use functions of the region's local authorities and the enforcement functions of the Garda, as well as the new regulatory functions for bus competition and the procurement function for transport infrastructure, including public-private partnerships. If we are to really move to a new era of worthwhile change in public transport, a body which can plan, procure, regulate, co-ordinate, enforce and, most important, implement is absolutely critical for Dublin.</P>
    <P>Every agency, public or private, which deals with any aspect of life in Dublin is less efficient today because of the failure of the Department of Public Enterprise to provide public transport, and its failure in the past to let anybody else do it either. It is not just the local authorities that are suffering but all bodies, such as the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the business associations, Dublin Port and Dublin Tourism. All these bodies spend inordinate amounts of time trying, and totally failing, to cope with the fall-out of the failure of the public transport system. If this new Dublin transport body is to come under the remit of any Department, it should come under the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The functions of that body, such as environmental concerns, roads and, in particular, land use, have far more to do with the Department of the Environment and Local Government than with the Department of Public Enterprise. Transport has always been inextricably linked with land use and it should be placed firmly in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to make some comments on the document on bus competition. I am delighted the Government now accepts the inevitability and desirability of competition as the way to increase capacity and to ensure a responsive, frequent and high quality service to the customer, which is the aim of any public transport service. We need to attract people to public transport rather than forcing them out of their cars. I have no problem with the broad principles and objectives outlined in the document. However, when it comes to how these objectives are to be achieved and over what time period, the document is timid, cautious and unambitious in the extreme. Unfortunately, the <Col N="688" /> traffic situation in Dublin is too urgent and critical to take this tentative approach.</P>
    <P>The recommended mode and timetable for the move to competitive tendering might have been devised by the CIE unions. There seems to be an underlying assumption that the only real players in terms of future competition will be Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, with a supporting role played by smaller private operators, whose role seems to be largely one of subcontractors to the main players. There is no reason to assume companies will not emerge that can compete with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. There seems to be a fear that opening up the system to competition too quickly will result in chaos and disgruntled unions, and that CIE companies must be nursed into the market to ensure their survival. I suspect this is an underestimation of CIE workers and management, who, I believe, are far readier for change than anyone gives them credit for. The lack of clarity about their future has, until now, been a debilitating cancer throughout every level of the organisation. What is required now is honesty and openness with them, rather than false promises of slow and tentative change that might never happen.</P>
    <P>There is no reason that the competitive tendering competition must wait until Dublin Bus is privatised. That is an excuse to long finger any real progress towards competition. Even with the best will in the world, as my colleague said, this could take years and would be an excuse to do nothing. We need a radical and brave move. I welcome the acceptance in the document that there really are no legislative barriers to allowing private operators into the market. I hope that move takes place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to restate the projections for travel growth in Dublin or to describe again what it is doing to the quality of life in Dublin, in terms of the stress levels of people who have to live here, business costs, our environment, our children, our air quality and our economy.</P>
    <P>I know the response required from the Government is enormous and that many difficult decisions need to be made. However, Governments are elected to make decisions and the Minister can no longer continue to dance around the problem. At some point, the debate must end, the consultants must be sent home and the hard decisions must be made. The Minister can set up a transport forum if she wants but she must not use it as an excuse for inaction. It cannot be a decision making body and it cannot have a veto. For too long, we have had experts and interest groups making decisions, or failing to allow anybody else make decisions. The people of Dublin are begging for leadership on the issue of transport above all others. If I can offer some consolation to the Minister in the difficult time she has ahead of her, it is that the only bad decision she can make now is to make no decision.</P>

      <P>The planning and development of the greater Dublin area is now at a critical stage. Rapid economic growth and an increase in population have resulted in a shortage of houses and an escalating housing market. Various estimates have been made of the future population of the greater Dublin area, with one forecast predicting a population of 1.93 million by 2011. It is obvious, therefore, that we need to plan for this. A radical change in planning policy is now being implemented. The urban environment as we know it is completely changing and I am not sure this is widely recognised.</P>
      <P>Central to the new policy is the introduction of higher residential densities and the development of a more comprehensive and efficient public transport system. These objectives are set out in the strategic planning guidelines and the residential density guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A development framework for the region covering transport, housing and economic development is now in place.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns about this new policy, particularly the higher density provisions. These are affecting existing amenities and the quality of the environment. Standards of design are questionable. In some areas, lovely old houses in traditional suburbs are being knocked down to make way for poor quality, high density apartment blocks, thus drastically altering the character of the locality. The planning authorities must give more careful consideration to planning applications like this in the selected areas to which I referred.</P>
      <P>I recognise the reality of public transport which confronts us as public representatives. Urban sprawl and the consequent traffic congestion cannot be allowed to continue. This congestion is an everyday occurrence in Counties Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Dublin. The Minister recognised there has been a lack of investment in public transport by successive Governments. In effect, we have only tinkered with the problem. As other speakers said, the public is now demanding a high quality public transport system. They want it revitalised and transformed. It is obvious that what is needed is an integrated package of measures, covering bus, rail and light rail transport as well as traffic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the longer term, the further development of the rail network is required. I congratulate the Minister for grasping this nettle once and for all. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 is the blueprint. It calls for balanced regional development but also makes provision for a substantial investment in public transport as part of a comprehensive strategy. Regarding the greater Dublin area, the plan provides for the implementation of the light rail network and major short-term investment in suburban rail, including the phased purchase of 46 additional DART cars and 58 diesel rail cars, the upgrading of the Greystones to Arklow line, the linking of Heuston and Con<Col N="690" /> nolly stations to permit the Kildare Arrow service to run through to Connolly, the quadrupling of track between Hazelhatch and Sallins to separate long distance and suburban services, new stations at Intel, Lucan, north and south, and Ashington, and the signalling of Howth to Barrow Street.</P>
    <P>The plan provides for a substantial enhancement and expansion of the bus service. There are provisions for the implementation of traffic management measures, including measures to respond to the needs of mobility-impaired and disabled people and additional cycling facilities. There is also a substantial contingency provision to meet the cost of implementing the recommendations of the strategic rail study and the underground section of Luas. According to the plan, the strategic rail study was completed by the end of 1999 and examines a range of options for the long-term development of the suburban rail network. A public private partnership approach to the implementation of light rail and rail projects will be used where appropriate. The investment programme will be complemented by a demand management strategy which will be developed by the Dublin Transportation Office during 2000 and implemented thereafter. This is set out clearly in pages 13 and 14 of the summary of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Chronic traffic congestion means that motorists are forced to consider abandoning their cars in an attempt to get to work. Nevertheless, car owners in this city realised the alternative was hopeless. They discovered that the much discussed park and ride facilities were almost non-existent. They also discovered there were too few buses on the quality bus corridors. The QBC experience deserves to be examined further. The planning and introduction of these caused much controversy and many people were affected. Consultation was endless, which I know as a public representative. Businesses and households were inconvenienced. Eventually they were built, the road space was reduced and the inevitable massive traffic jams ensued. Journey times for motorists increased substantially. As they sat in traffic jams, they became even more frustrated as they observed the empty bus lanes. When they finally decided to take the bus instead, they found an unreliable, poor quality, infrequent bus service despite all the promises made.</P>
    <P>The QBC experience has almost irredeemably damaged motorists' view of public transport. The lesson is clear &ndash; a much enhanced bus network is required. That is why the deliberations of the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships are so important. These provide for a new institutional framework for public transport and for limited competition on route franchising in the greater Dublin area bus market. I am glad the proposals of the committee come out against deregulation of the bus service. By any criteria, these are radical proposals and if they are successful, the Minister will have secured her place in history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> The Minister wants a review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, and increased competition generally. Public private partnerships will also be used. I urge her to press ahead with her programme, but, as she said, in full consultation with CIE, PAMBO and the trade unions, under the provisions set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I welcome the fact that the public transport partnership forum will meet later this month to begin that process. The Minister has made radical proposals, involving the setting up of a public transport regulatory body. Massive changes are proposed for Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and private bus operators. It is proposed to establish a railway infrastructure company, a railway operating company and an infrastructure procurement body. These are all big changes which are necessary. I wish the Minister every success in her endeavours.</P>
    <P>A regulatory body for the Dublin area is being considered. We need a separate regulatory body. There has been criticism that there are too many organisations and vested interests looking after traffic and transportation in the Dublin area. I would welcome a separate regulatory body. On the institutional side, the time has come to consider a Minister with sole responsibility for transport issues. The previous speaker, Deputy Mitchell, also highlighted this issue. Transport is such a serious and comprehensive matter that consideration should be given to having a Minister with sole responsibility for transport.</P>
    <P>A light rail line is proposed from Dublin Airport and there are private buses operating on the route. However, it is unbelievable that in this day and age the airport is still not satisfactorily serviced by public transport. I would welcome any new provisions in relation to a metro system for the Dublin area. I call on the Minister to implement in total the report on rail safety and, to be parochial, particularly in relation to the DART service, though also in relation to the rail network throughout the country. I congratulate the Minister and wish her every success with her programme.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Government does not have a transport policy; it has proposals for privatisation. That is not a policy but a substitute for policy and is in line with the general trend of Government opinion on the State and semi-State sectors as well as on the public services. Unfortunately, the people of Ireland, and those of Dublin in particular, who are suffering acutely from the lack of public transport investment over many decades, can have no confidence in this Government providing any real relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Privatisation may well satisfy those who make large political donations to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, but it is not a policy to provide frequent, efficient and cheap public transport for those who need it for work and other reasons. The Government now proposes to privatise sections of Dublin Bus and there can be <Col N="692" /> no question that privatising all of Dublin Bus is the agenda. It will then see what it can do with Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann. However, the Eircom debacle should be a warning to ordinary people about what can be expected from a privatisation programme. We had an incredibly cynical circus for months leading up to that privatisation trying to induce ordinary people to become involved in purchasing shares as this critical State company was to be sold off. Once people contributed and became enmeshed in the Government's privatisation programme they were thrown to the wolves as operators from the stock exchanges and financial markets came into play.</P>
    <P>Privatisation may be a route for some people to become super rich and we have had obscene examples of private individuals being given valuable State assets in the form of telecommunications licences or being handed the companies themselves and who are or have become millionaires tens or even hundreds of times over. That is the cynical approach of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government and it does not augur well for providing a proper transport policy.</P>
    <P>For generations Dublin Bus relied on the disgracefully low wage regime of the bus workers to subsidise its operation in an absolutely incredible situation; even the Minister had to acknowledge the low wage regime in Dublin Bus. However, successive Governments, including the current Administration and its predecessor, stood aside and allowed inadequate subsidies to prevail so that low pay and the forbearance of Dublin Bus workers were keeping the service on the road. At the end of the day, the patience of the workers naturally snapped and, quite correctly, they demanded their rights. The wrongs to which they were subjected have begun to be redressed, though there is still some way to go. The Dublin Bus subsidy was wholly inadequate and when trying to defend it the Minister has used the low point the subsidy reached in the late 1980s or early 1990s, stating the Government has increased the subsidy from that figure. However, we should look at a 20-year period, as that shows it has gone down. In comparison with Europe and even the United States, the bastion of capitalism, the subsidy for the public transport system in the capital city was pathetically inadequate. Instead of coming up with sufficient investment and a plan to provide a proper public transport system we have privatisation</P>
    <P>The thrust of successive Governments over many decades has been to pour money in massive quantities into road developments. It would be true to say that since the foundation of the State not a single kilometre of new rail track has been laid down. That is an indictment of successive Governments and their attitude to public transport. We have a national development plan promising more than £40 billion in five to seven years, yet we do not have proposals for new areas of public transport. We do not, for example, have a proposal to reinstate the railway line between <Col N="693" /> Galway and Sligo and to extend it up into Donegal. That would be a critical infrastructural development in a national plan of this nature to have proper transport and to solve the environmental crisis we are in due to emissions from road transport. However, there are no proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>The burgeoning community of greater Blanchardstown in Dublin 15 is at the end of its tether regarding the provision of public transport. There are 70,000 people living there and according to the old plan this figure was set to rise to 100,000, though the latest development plan adopted by Fingal County Council suggests that the population will soon be 120,000. The area is served by 24 trains daily, 17 on Saturday and none on Sundays or Bank Holidays. The Minister has committed some funds to this area, but implementation of the investment is painfully slow. There is also appalling overcrowding on trains coming from Maynooth through Clonsilla and Blanchardstown to the city centre and in the opposite direction. Areas that are growing rapidly need specialised investment. We need a DART standard service for Dublin 15 and major investment in the bus routes. I am wholly in favour of bus lanes &ndash; we must change people from private to public transport by providing a better service  &ndash; but if one gets a bus in Dublin 15 at 7.30 a.m., the inadequate bus lanes mean one gets to the city centre at the same time as a private car. While we have that situation we will not convince people to leave their cars at home and to take the bus. We need urgent investment and action in this area.</P>
    <P>Excuse me if I am cynical about public-private partnerships. The West Link toll bridge in my constituency is an example. In that case a private company has been given permission to build a new bridge across the Liffey valley. In less than one year, with traffic at the expected peak, it will clear the capital cost of that co-called enterprise and for the next 20 years it will generate profit for a private firm whose only contribution to transport in Dublin is to create a massive obstacle on the M50. This morning the traffic was backed up from the toll bridge not only to the Navan Road but further towards Finglas. This is simply to cream off funds for a private firm. If this is to be the pattern of public private partnerships, people will wait in vain for a decent transport system.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her transport policy and on her tremendous work in office. We have listened to many contributors who were in a position to do something different but they did not. I am seeking to bring balance to this debate because Members appear to think that transport begins and ends in Dublin. <Col N="694" /> It should be pointed out that there is a large area outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>That is not to detract from the fact that Dublin needs help and a policy focused on Dublin. I left Leinster House before rush hour last Thursday. Usually I wait until after rush hour but by now I am not sure exactly when it is. It took me an hour to get from Leinster House to Finglas. From my point of view that was a bad delay although many others would say it was not. The bus corridors are helpful but the sheer volume of traffic is huge. The number of cars, an indication of the burgeoning economy being overseen by the Government, is leading to problems but the Minister is well on the way to controlling them.</P>
      <P>There is life outside Dublin. I continued my journey last Thursday and it took me five and a half hours to get home. It is unfair that an Ulster Deputy should not have the same facilities as Deputies from Leinster, Munster and Connacht. It is also unfair that my constituents do not have the same facilities as their constituents. They have a right to decent road, rail and air access. In that regard, I thank the Minister for the level of interest she has shown in creating the Dublin-Derry air link. It is most important. People tend to forget that Derry is the fourth largest city in the country. It should have a link to the largest city. It is the least that should happen given that Belfast is linked with Cork. I am happy Aer Arann has announced that it will commence the Derry-Dublin air link from 12 June. It is up to us to make it work but I urge the Minister to keep her finger on the pulse in relation to the PSO for that service. It is badly needed and will be useful.</P>
      <P>However, it is just one part of a three part development. We also need road and rail links. Now that the Executive is re-established, I urge the Minister to work on the Derry to Dublin direct train service. An existing line from Belfast to Derry could be upgraded and alternative routes could be pursued. I do not exclude the concept of Sligo being linked to Donegal and on to Derry. We, too, live on the island and we deserve this type of service. There is support in Europe for this type of development and the Minister is also sympathetic to ensuring that County Donegal is brought more in touch in real terms with the hub of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to put pressure on the Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive to upgrade the A5 road. I am aware it is within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government but buses and cars travel this road which links the fourth largest city with the capital. The rural transport policy will get support under the national development plan. It is vital for rural areas that this policy is improved. In many areas of my constituency the free bus pass is of little use to people because there are no buses or bus routes. I am aware that the Minister has a particular interest in this issue. It is open for development and development is not impossible. There should be support for upgrading and pro<Col N="695" /> viding buses. There is a large project in relation to Dublin Bus but it should expand beyond that.</P>
    <P>At present, one can benefit from student fares when one is under 16 years of age and over 18 years. What happens to the 16 to 18 year olds? They seem to fall between the two stools and I hope the Minister will address that problem.</P>
    <P>Donegal is seeking decentralisation. The county has many merits to attract people. It is a relatively undiscovered gem and decentralisation would assist in resolving Dublin's transport problems. Transport policy must have relevance to and an impact on all areas of the country. All support devoted to areas outside Dublin will also assist Dublin because it will ease pressure in the city. I trust the national development plan and the Objective One status of Donegal will do that.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Keaveney agus leis an Rialtas as a gcuid ama a roinnt chomh maith. Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht ar chúrsaí taistil phoiblí anseo inniu. The Minister said that neither she nor her Department claims to have all the answers and that they would welcome suggestions. I hope my contribution will be taken in that spirit.</P>
      <P>Until now there have been different analyses from the left and right perspectives with regard to public or private management of transport. The Green Party favours public control of public transport but it also supports competition within a public regulatory framework. I hope that will happen. The Minister also said that resources are not unlimited and that she will look to private public partnerships as a means of providing some of the funding as well as bringing in specialist skills and innovation. The Minister has had either limited advice or limited foresight in relation to demand for public transport. The Dublin Transportation Office has warned that investment in transport in the capital &ndash; I accept Deputy Keaveney's point that Dublin is not the rest of the country &ndash; will have to be five times what is planned. In other words, it will require not £1.5 billion but up to £10 billion to meet projected need.</P>
      <P>A sum of £6 billion is earmarked in the national development plan for roads while £2 billion is set aside for public transport. We must look at where public transport fits within the priority list of needs in the country. If £1.5 billion is to go to public transport in Dublin, £500 million will be left. Approximately £600 million will be required for remedial safety work. In effect, the rest of the country will simply be subject to remedial work rather than improvements, unless there is other funding that has not so far been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional railway lines have not been built since Independence. However, many lines have been ripped up and used as spare parts. As a result, our railway lines are badly maintained compared with those in the rest of Europe. This country, therefore, is starting from a low base and <Col N="696" /> we must be conscious of that. One must also bear in mind the growing trends which in the case of the UK were outlined in a BBC television programme &ndash; the Minister might tell us if there are comparative Irish figures &ndash; in relation to the average distance the citizen travels each year and how that is increasing. In the UK in 1950, the average distance travelled by a citizen was five miles per day. This year the average distance has increased to 30 miles per day and in 2020 it will be 60 miles per day. There is a hyper mobility trend on which the Government has no policy and the Minister should address this aspect rather than following the trend. She should ensure there is a reduction in demand rather than continuing to cater for the rising demand.</P>
    <P>There has been no policy decision on the park and ride facility. Who is responsible for providing this service? Iarnród Éireann says it is the local authority's responsibility and the local authority says it is the responsibility of Iarnród Éireann. Meanwhile the customer and commuter is blocking up emergency services and streets in small towns where people literally drop cars, go to work and hope for the best.</P>
    <P>A customer charter is needed to deal with the basic rights of customers, such as bus shelters, notice of timetables, punctuality and explanations in the event of their not being forthcoming. There is a lot of talk about public transport but I cannot improve on the Chinese proverb in relation to delivering this service which states that if one is not going to lay an egg, one should not make a sound like a chicken. In terms of public transport, there have been an awful lot of sounds like chickens.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on the transport requirements for Ireland's second largest city, Cork, because the majority of speakers have concentrated on the Dublin area. The transport and traffic problems in Dublin are widespread and need radical action. I agree with some of the measures being taken by the Minister. However, the concentration on the capital's needs has resulted in other urban centres throughout the country being neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a physical infrastructural point of view, Cork has developed well in the past 20 years with the implementation of the LUTS study. However, the public transport side of LUTS has not developed. Various studies have been done on investment requirements and traffic plans for Cork city and surrounding areas. The one that carries most weight was commissioned by the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport last year. It is entitled Public Transport Investment Priorities for the Millennium. A number of Cork Deputies, in consultation with managers <Col N="697" /> from Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, together with representatives from CIE, Bus Éireann and the local traffic gardaí, put a huge amount of work into providing information for this document. If even the majority of what is being proposed in this document were implemented, Cork would become a model for cities seeking solutions to public transport problems.</P>
    <P>Suburban rail has huge possibilities in Cork city. The present rail lines need to be extended and improved. If given an efficient rail service, the public have shown an increasing willingness to use it. The passenger numbers, for example, on the Cork to Cobh line have doubled in the past eight years. Surely this suggests we should extend the service to other areas on the north side of the city as the rail lines already exist. The report proposes the creation of new urban stations on the lines from Cork to Cobh and Mallow to Cork and on the new extension from Cork to Midleton. As local authorities in Cork desperately seek suitable nodes for housing development around the city, by providing a commuter rail service now we are anticipating public transport problems before they arise. This is called spatial planning and should be happening when we can afford to do so and before the population builds up. On the wider rail issue, the main links between centres of population need drastic improvement. People should be able to travel from Cork to Dublin in close to 90 minutes. This is planned in the national development plan but I would like to see it implemented sooner rather than later. Other European countries have rail systems that travel at the speeds required in this era.</P>
    <P>The bus fleet in Cork at present comprises 63 buses. A conservative estimate of what is needed is an increase in fleet size by one quarter. I welcome the new buses that have been provided and the further additions promised. I particularly welcome the fact that they are all wheelchair accessible. We laboured that point with the Minister and I thank her for taking note of it. However, I regret that the new additions are merely replacing old buses that have been put out to grass, some of which were 15 and 16 years old. The overall fleet size is not increasing, despite the drastic increase in populations, particularly in the satellite towns around Cork city. The message is simple from Bus Éireann in Cork. We need more buses to increase the fleet size and we need to modernise it. If this does not happen, we will never persuade people to leave their cars at home on a daily basis. I welcome the improvements and plans for the Parnell Place bus station in Cork city.</P>
    <P>An incredibly frustrating situation has existed in both Cork and Limerick for over two years. Mini and Midi buses in both cities have been sitting idle while an industrial relations dispute between Bus Éireann drivers and management has not been resolved. As a result, an area with more than 4,000 houses in my constituency has no real bus service. Solutions to this problem <Col N="698" /> have been promised since I was first elected 18 months ago, yet nothing has happened. It is a scandal that children and parents cannot even get the bus to school or to work should they choose to do so. As a result, this is a traffic blackspot in my city.</P>
    <P>There has been no development in Cork on the issue of park and ride facilities. Aer Rianta came to Cork a number of months ago and promised expensive and very ambitious plans involving an investment programme of approximately £70 million for the airport. There has been no progress in this regard, apart from beginning a hotel project. I would like the Minister to make inquiries in this regard.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I will take up from where Deputy Keaveney left off in relation to public transport policy. We in the west are starting from a very low base. Indeed the Minister will recall not too long ago the rumour that the Dublin-Galway Iarnród Éireann link would cease in Athlone. As one looks westwards from Athlone across the Shannon, one can see that transport policy simply does not exist. Transport exists and rumbles on in one way or other, but there is no transport policy for the west. The conditions in the area necessitate greater thought. I hope any forum established by the Minister will link together the fragmentation of policy throughout the country. Transport policy should not just focus on Dublin.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to be open to suggestions for a wider public service throughout the country. If she is seriously interested in public transport and co-operation with public private partnerships, she has an ideal opportunity available to her in that there is an almost completely disused railway link between Sligo and Limerick, passing through Tuam and Gort in my constituency. This link is utilised just once a day. The Minister should investigate the potential of this rail line by asking a private company to utilise and develop the facility. It is an ideal opportunity to transfer commuters from road to rail at no cost. The rail line is already in existence but it may need slight upgrading. This facility should be investigated on a pilot scheme basis to see if it is a feasible alternative. If it was open for private development it would work. The line was run down in the 1980s by CIE which operated a parallel bus service at the same times, or immediately prior to the arrival of the train from Limerick which travelled onwards to Sligo. Naturally, people took the first available form of transport. By doing this CIE, or Iarnród Éireann as it is now, choked that service. It is not good enough to allow that continue and I ask the Minister to investigate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other morning while travelling to the House I listened to Galway Bay FM when the <Col N="699" /> Minister of State, Éamon Ó Cuív, who supports a new airport at Oranmore, said grants should no longer be provided to Galway Airport, while the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, supported the existing airport at Carnmore. The Minister for Public Enterprise is the ham in the sandwich as she will say she will give money to both or the best option. However, that does not constitute a transport policy. While we are kicking public transport policy around like a football it will not work.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine the possibility of operating, on a pilot basis, a small commuter rail service between towns such as Tuam, Athenry and Galway as an alternative to road transport? If Iarnród Éireann had the initiative to use the railway line at times when it is under utilised we could make progress in an area which needs attention because of the infrastructure in the west.</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate which was extremely interesting. The subject of the debate was the regulatory and institutional papers on reform, but it was good that the debate mentioned different parts of the country, including Donegal, where there is no railway, Galway, Athenry, Tuam, Sligo and Dublin City and County, which was mentioned by Deputy Joe Higgins. Many interesting points were raised and I thank those who contributed, in particular for the encouragement given by the Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Yates. He and I have barneys from time to time, as do I and Deputy Stagg, but his comments were helpful and I will bear them in mind.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt all these reforms will cost money, so nobody should think that instituting them is a cheap way out. Several questions were posed regarding the advisability of a forum in the context of being in favour of discussions in general but wondering if nothing would be done if we kept talking. The only way to do business is by talking and we will endeavour to ensure discussions are brisk and in line with a set programme. In the end,&ldquo;jaw-jaw&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;war-war&rdquo;, and it works. Neither have I any illusions about the challenges &ndash; much stronger words could be used &ndash; in this process.</P>
      <P>These papers are just the beginning of the process, but we have appended to them what we aim to do during 2000, 2001 and so on. Deputy Stagg and others are correct in saying it will be some time and that there will be a change of Government before it is all realised. It is up to a future Government to undo what is done if it so wishes &ndash; that will be its democratic right and I have always accepted this. It would take brave people to start to undo the process, but why not if they want to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make as much haste as possible as I am conscious of time going by. We are in the second half of the life of the Government and I want to do the business in terms of institutional and regu<Col N="700" /> latory reform. This is not done out of a sense of malice or ill-will. In fact I paid tribute to the countless thousands of men and some women who over the years have contributed to CIE. Those of us who come from railway towns are aware of this. I was brought up 50 yards from Athlone railway station, and the noises, people and activities associated with a major railway crossing have always been very strong in my mind. However, change is necessary and we must offer consumers an attractive, available and accessible option.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with what is taking place in terms of accessibility. The 230 buses bought this year will be accessible. Deputy Coveney spoke about the new buses in Cork being accessible. Within a few years every bus will be accessible. This should have happened long ago and there is no great patronage involved. Many stations have become more accessible, although this is very difficult for some of the older stations because of their geography and design. However, some very imaginative steps have been taken and I hope this will happen increasingly.</P>
    <P>Several very interesting questions were raised about rural areas and I will endeavour to give written replies to the Deputies concerned &ndash; I will talk to the officials in charge.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its interest in the topic. Transport is an abiding and now an imperative interest for all of us if we are not to find ourselves unable to make progress. When I came into the Department I did not think I would get as far as publishing a paper on institutional and regulatory reform. Circumstances over recent months meant urgent debate was necessary if there were to be changes, and that is what we will have at the forum, starting tomorrow week. I will certainly take on board the comments made today and I hope we can have a review of progress in a few months.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. At long last a western gas link is being provided. The significance of such a link to the west must be highlighted if it is to benefit fully from potential development. In a recent parliamentary question I raised the need for additional sources of energy in the west. There are few alternatives. We are very dependent on outside energy supplies. There were a number of very small turf-burning stations along the west coast, including Screeb in Connemara and Miltown Malbay in County Clare. While they served their purpose in utilising natural resources available locally and in providing employment, in time they proved uneconomic. The position is far more serious however in the midlands, particularly in Offaly. Is it being said that the life of <Col N="701" /> these stations is coming to an end given that it is more economic to use gas to generate power? This would result in serious problems in the structure of employment leading to displacement. What does the future hold for the employees concerned? What role will they play in meeting our overall energy requirements? During the years the development of Derrynafada bog was a political football in north east Galway. It was raised as an issue prior to every election. It was akin to the draining of the Shannon. It is now accepted that it will not be developed for the production of electricity, as intended.</P>
      <P>Few areas throughout the country are suitable for the development of wind farms as an alternative to the traditional methods of generating electricity. It is obvious that such a farm would amount to a physical intrusion on the landscape of Connemara which would be regarded as an ideal location and in which, as Deputy Higgins is aware, there are some small developments. One area in particular &ndash; Sliabh Aughty stretching from Loughrea to Gort, the Clare border and Woodford &ndash; has been pinpointed as ideal and is being trawled for available sites. Wind farms offer an alternative source of income to small farmers who find it practically impossible to make a reasonable living from their farms. If small farmers can come together in a spirit of co-operation and make land available progress will be made. It will be necessary however to bring in outside capital and expertise. I have witnessed Danish, Dutch and German companies trawling east Galway for available sites.</P>
      <P>There is an unwillingness on the part of the ESB to allow wind farms free or reasonable access to the main grid to distribute the energy they produce. The ESB is erecting unnecessary barriers. Why will it not co-operate? If energy can be produced economically in east Galway, will it site one station in the region to which the rest can be linked rather than have a network of transmission cables going hither and thither across the landscape? There is a need for co-ordination to ensure wind farms do not connect to separate lines running to Gort, Moneypoint and adjacent towns. If that were to happen it would be an unnecessary scar on the landscape. It is time the ESB was asked to provide a central point which should be planned well in advance to enable the applications which are rapidly coming on stream to be planned efficiently and effectively to ensure the landscape will not be scarred in the way the atmosphere has been polluted. With proper planning small farmers in particular who do not have an alternative source of income will have an opportunity to exploit the potential of wind farms to their great advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coillte has been very amenable to most requests for access to its property which is under afforestation. It has adopted a positive approach to the many demands made on it. As a consequence small patches of land ideally suited to the generation of wind power have been released. Towns such as Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Gort <Col N="702" /> have suffered severely from a lack of industry over the past 25 years, and not one IDA assisted job has been created in Ballinasloe in the past 27 years. That is an appalling record. Following battles with IDA, Galway, and Enterprise Ireland there is now a wonderful industrial park in the town. However, three months ago the House debated the closure of AT Cross, the flagship industry in Ballinasloe, and only minor operations are now taking place at the plant. This was a severe loss of a traditional flagship industry.</P>
    <P>Other industries located in Ballinasloe are providing employment and we are thankful for that. However, this is an opportunity to attract industry, in spite of the IDA's localised attention to Galway. Galway city is like a honey pot &ndash; everything goes to Galway and the IDA does not think beyond that location. This is an opportunity to distribute industry to areas such as Ballinasloe, Loughrea, Gort, Athenry, Tuam or wherever, provided there is a willingness to utilise it to the full. I hope the Minister of State will make it clear to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland that this welcome facility will provide an opportunity which they must utilise to the full. These agencies must co-operate and think beyond Galway city and its environs.</P>
    <P>Is it the intention to locate a power station somewhere in County Galway as a result of this new gas link? Gas is an efficient source of electricity and there is a shortfall of electricity supply in the west. I hope a power station will be located in the west, which lost Scriven in Connemara, which was a minor contributor, and we are seeking an alternative facility.</P>
    <P>I hope towns in the west will be linked to the gas mains for domestic supplies. However, the provision of domestic supplies to urban areas will involve significant disruption. I welcome the fact that water and sewerage facilities in many of these urban towns are at last being upgraded, and within the next five to ten years most towns in Galway will have upgraded water, sewerage and gas facilities. This work will involve the excavation of streets for these three services, apart from the current work involving telecommunications links. I hope that when these links are being planned they will be notified to local authorities so that some degree of co-ordination and co-operation can take place. It is feasible that all these services could be installed at the same time. If, for example, water and sewerage work is being done in Loughrea immediately, can we not make provision for linking the town to the new gas supply, even if it will not happen until some point in the future? This would avoid the re-excavation of roads.</P>
    <P>People travelling to the west this holiday weekend will see the traffic jams in towns such as Loughrea which do not have a bypass. We are discussing the cost factors and delays involved in energy and related topics. The NRA informed me today that the Loughrea bypass has been on hold for 15 years. This means we had 15 years to plan the bypass and I respectfully suggest to the Mini<Col N="703" /> ster of State that we plan ahead for domestic supplies of gas to such towns. This would avoid the hideous repetition of digging up roads.</P>
    <P>If we are to reap the benefits of this major and welcome gas link to the west there must be co-operation. This project involves laying a pipeline from A to B but it is not good enough to leave it at that. We have to indicate the potential of this development for the various centres along the line. In addition to domestic supplies, we have to indicate what volume of gas will be available for the generation of electricity, if that is the intention, what volume will be available for industry and what industries will be allowed to open.</P>
    <P>The west is not a suitable location for the development of a chemical industry, which is classified as a dirty industry. However, we need to know in advance the volume of gas available to respective interest groups so we can utilise the supply to the best advantage of this area which has been neglected for so long. I do not say this in a political sense but there has been emigration from this region and rural areas have been decimated. If the availability of some of this resource is known in advance, people will be able to see a future for themselves in the region and plan ahead. When this link comes to fruition, I hope it will be planned and people will know there is a resource which can be utilised and is readily available to all who need it, whether for industrial development or electricity generation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that contributors to this debate are concentrating on the legacy of development neglect which prevails in their areas and the prospects which might arise from the delivery of a new energy source. I understand what they are saying in terms of the relationship of an energy source to infrastructure and the capacity for development. However, that is preliminary to the specific intention of this legislation. I will add another preliminary by saying it is regrettable that the discovery of significant reserves of gas off the west coast and the manner in which the licences were allocated were to the unnecessary exclusion of employment opportunities for Irish workers. It may not be too late to amend some of the second phase of these exclusions, but it casts a shadow over the promotion of this discovery. There is no point in my putting it differently. The social and political circumstances in which allocations were made and the employment regimes, were laid down and the consequences are the talk of the west. We must move on from that.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with fundamental flaws in the legislation. Sections 4 and 5, in particular, effectively enhance the role of the regulator. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise has a reputation in this House for listening to argument and responding generously. I hope he will not take it amiss if I say that characteristic is not shared by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She would be well advised to read the seminal <Col N="704" /> paper on regulation and regulators delivered by the then Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, to the Law Society of University College Dublin. Mr. Byrne, now a member of the European Commission, addressed a most complex issue in a wide-ranging way. He examined the law and the jurisprudence that lies behind the role of the regulator in the United States and in several European countries. Without having his paper in front of me, but clearly remembering its significance, perhaps one of its most important points is that the role of the regulator cannot be defined as subverting the role of the legislator. While the legislator, the Minister of the day, hands an envelope of policy decisions to the regulator, Commission Byrne's conclusion is that one could not give the regulator an unspecified remit on regulation. Immense difficulties would arise if there are departures from such an interpretation of the relationship between the Minister and the regulator.</P>
    <P>I will go a little further and say it is an abuse of the legal base to argue that one can give an open-ended interpretative power to the regulator. When replying, I challenge the Minister of State or the Minister, should she want to return to defend her ideological position, to show where in the European interpretation of the role of the regulator there has been such an open-ended interpretation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to contemplate what is at stake and the appalling shambles to which it could give rise. Effectively, section 4 excludes the ESB from being a customer for gas for the generation of energy. Apart from anything else, this mixes two separate pieces of legislation in an unsatisfactory manner. An existing regime is laid down for the liberalisation of the electricity market and regulation of this sector but, somewhat in breach of the directive from which much of this legislation is derived, the Minister appears to want to take the position of a company in one part of the energy market and use it as a lever for the exclusion of another part of the energy market. To put it bluntly, it is an abuse of the legal regime. In any event, it will be tested should this legislation get through and, if it does, I hope sections 4 and 5 will be amended.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social implications of this, we are on the verge of facing fairly regular energy shortages, perhaps within 12 months. Two or three steps could have been taken to alleviate or avert the current crisis. The Electricity Supply Board could have been given permission to proceed with the construction of its other energy source at Ringsend and to remove the obstacles towards it securing a supply for it. Also, an additional gas connector could have been secured. Those points were developed by Deputy Stagg.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate on what I consider an unusual interpretation of the European law on this matter, a complete misconstruction of the directive and the danger of handing over legislative power in an unspecified manner to the regu<Col N="705" /> lator. The role of the regulator is interesting, even in relation to section 4. The regulator is allowed to have a market opinion, but the Bill does not specify how that opinion is to be achieved. Deputy Burke's point on this was interesting. In a narrow, distorted, twisted version of energy competition, the Electricity Supply Board is being excluded as a player. It is being excluded on a basis covered in section 4. I want to be as accurate as I can on this in view of the proliferate abuse of the European directive in the Minister's case. Section 4 deals with supplementary provisions to be included in regulations with respect to method of selection. The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Section </i>4 contains supplementary provisions to be included in the regulations relating to the selection procedure. Additional provisions in relation to precedence include alterations in ranking to preclude the selection of an applicant where, in the opinion of the Commission, the selection of that applicant would adversely affect the promotion of competition in the electricity market.</P>
    <P>If one checks the European directive from which that is derived, one will learn this is supposed to be for the benefit of the consumer. Therefore, one must literally blackguard the ESB so as to give an unfair competitive advantage to a small number of non-State or semi-State suppliers. The manner in which the ESB, which transformed the face of Ireland, is treated in this legislation is outrageous.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting side to this. To take the points made by my colleague from east Galway, Deputy Burke, it relates to the provision of infrastructure in general. Another regulator has a function in telecommunications. Having regard to the impact of regulation in that market, if one interpreted competition in a purely narrow market sense, irrespective of its social consequences, one would have what one will get in relation to the west. I hope Deputy Burke adverted to that. Taking Telecom Éireann out of the equation has meant, in many cases, that the new competition in telephonic services is coming in where the market can support it. The fibre optic lines are going to where the money is. In the same way as in this legislation, a fundamental shift is taking place. If one were to take the ESB out of the equation, on the basis that its position in the electricity market disqualifies it from being supplied with gas for the purposes of electricity generation, it would be done without taking cognisance of the consequences of energy shortages.</P>
    <P>It is irresponsible and is ideologically driven because the ESB must be hammered. At the other side one has to look at who one is left with in relation to the people to be supplied with gas. Has the Minister any indication that there will be universality of provision rather than selective provision? Universality giving way to selective provision is already happening. A whole range of <Col N="706" /> areas in the west are excluded from fibre optic coverage because of a selective rather than a universal interpretation. It is dishonest and unfair to say these considerations do not apply. They do apply and were mentioned during the debate on the competition regime and how it would be introduced in Ireland. It was mentioned in the House and guarantees were given by Government in relation to universality of provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her flippant approach to the House, which has deteriorated almost every week in the past few years to a point where it is farcical, simply will not answer the question. Where does she stand on Commissioner Byrne's paper, delivered in UCD to the Law Society when he was Attorney General, in relation to the responsibility of the Minister of the day to give a clear set of policy decisions to the regulator? That is the role of the regulator in Europe and in America. What is the role of the regulator here? There is no legislation that gives as loose an interpretation of the role and functions of the regulator as this ridiculous section 4. How would such legislation going through this House ever be made accountable? The explanatory memorandum states, &ldquo;Additional provisions. preclude the selection of an applicant where, in the opinion of the Commission, the selection of that applicant would adversely affect the promotion of competition in the electricity market.&rdquo;  How are we to evaluate that? The Minister from the land of nod will say, &ldquo;It is not our business, I am washing my hands of it.&rdquo;  She cannot wash her hands of responsibility in relation to the adequacy of energy supply and the right of suppliers to be treated equally. I am not finished with that matter.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Department, which changes its title so often, has recognised, as I believe the Minister of State has, there will be an electricity generation capacity shortage as early as the end of next year. What this legislation does not take account of is that the Irish electricity market has already been opened to competition and that there are a number of electricity generation projects to service the liberalised section of the Irish electricity market. I am not in favour of a single player or of any quasi monopolistic abuse. I have the greatest sympathy for all the Green energy producers who are anxious to be treated fairly. They have the right to benefit from the role of the regulator to ensure they get a fair regime. It is well that we are actually behind. It is welcome. There is no point in recrimination, that is not my business and I am not interested in recrimination. We are probably late entrants into the field of alternative energy supply in both wind and wave energy. I am interested in all these alternative sources being treated fairly and in a way in which there can never be an abuse of a monopolistic position.</P>
    <P>It is incredible to move from a regime that regulates the production of electricity to one that threatens the disposal of gas. There is no basis for removing a player, no matter what is said, and taking the best dressed candidate that comes <Col N="707" /> along but it cannot be X. I ask the Minister to stop in her tracks before adopting this approach. Why is the Minister trying it? It is because of this incredible ideological opposition to anything associated with the State or semi-State companies. My second job was with the Electricity Supply Board. I am a grade A clerk, retired and earned £6.14s. 2d per week in 1962 but I do not derive any pension benefit from it. I joined as a clerk when the last stages of rural electrification were being completed. Electricity was supplied by the ESB to places where no market ideologue would even be got to slow down their car. That is the reality. It was a fine organisation. In this I include those who worked at installing it and bringing it to inaccessible and remote places and also those who built up a fine tradition. What is wrong with it now is that there must be other market players. I accept that my view is a minority one.</P>
    <P>A majority was in favour of Maastricht. It would appear there are Governments that are willing to abuse Maastricht, and I would describe this as an abuse of Maastricht. It the Minister would stop giggling, it would be interesting to hear her reply. We have to create a kind of virtual Minister now. When she does reply she might like to answer the questions I have asked in respect of the directive &ndash; I refer to the gas directive 98/30/EC. An article of the gas directive clearly states: &ldquo;Member states shall take the necessary measures to ensure that gas fired generators are designated as eligible customers.&rdquo;  That is as clear as day. How can the Minister in interpreting that language exclude an ESB-Statoil partnership? On what basis can it be said it is not an eligible customer? This status, under article 16 of the gas directive, permits the eligible customer the right of access to the gas transmission system the member state concerned to enter into a supply contract with gas undertakings inside or outside the territory.</P>
    <P>What a great pity it is that a Minister from a party that once liked to associate itself with the great semi-State transformations and the inclusion of people as citizens into the right to consume energy would bring in something that is illegal, inappropriate, an abuse of text and give rights to a regulator that are born of the lazy actions of the Minister. I challenge her yet again, as in all her other areas, to define the role of the regulator and to stop running away from the House. If the legislation is passed in this form she will not have to account for anything in relation to energy supply in this House. That is a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their worthy contributions. I should say to Deputy Higgins that I have been delegated responsibility for the gas industry and for this Bill which I am endeavouring to bring through the House. I am happy to take responsibility for any merits or demerits and I hope I will be able to address the questions raised by colleagues, <Col N="708" /> including Deputy Higgins, in the course of my reply.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward the Bill I am seeking to address four different issues, two of which require immediate attention. The first and most pressing is to provide for a scheme to allocate scarce capacity in the natural gas network. The purpose of this scheme is twofold. First, given that prospective power producers are seeking access to more capacity than is available in the system at the moment, it will ensure that the available capacity is allocated in a fair and transparent manner. Second, power producers need certainty in relation to gas capacity in order to seek finance for proposed projects. In allocating capacity in the gas network to the power producers which are selected under the scheme provided for in the Bill, it will enable them to proceed with their projects which will ensure that additional electricity generating capacity will be available in the State in the next couple of years to meet forecast increases in demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that there is absolutely no threat of disruption to existing gas customers. There is sufficient capacity in the system to meet forecast gas demand until 2004. Neither is it the case that BGE will be constrained in connecting and supplying new customers. Sufficient capacity to fuel approximately 800 megawatts of electricity generating capacity is available in the gas network. I have decided that this will be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling new power plants to meet the expected increase in demand for electricity in the next couple of years. There is a set of converging circumstances which has resulted in there being limited capacity available in the natural gas network in the short term. Demand for natural gas has been increasing at a greater rate than expected. So too has demand for electricity and this is directly related to the unprecedented levels of economic growth that we have experienced in recent years and which it is hoped will continue well into the coming years.</P>
      <P>The gas interconnector with Scotland is nearing full capacity some ten years sooner than had been anticipated owing to the greater than expected growth rate. In addition, the demand for natural gas is being boosted further by the opening of the electricity market. BGE has received applications for network capacity that would be sufficient to fuel 4,000 watts of electricity generating capacity. The vast majority of new power plants being constructed around the world are gas-fired plants. The development of combined cycle gas technology which provides the most efficient form of generation means that natural gas is now the preferred fuel for power generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard what Deputy Stagg said about possible over-reliance on gas. I am very aware of this. I assure him that security of energy supply is at the top of my agenda. Neither my Department nor I have been ignoring the question of the provision of additional gas infrastructure. My Department and BGE have undertaken a major study, the Gas 2025 study on future natural gas infrastructu<Col N="709" /> ral requirements. While the study concluded that the optimal solutions to satisfy future requirement would be to construct a second natural gas interconnector with the UK parallel to the existing Scotland-Ireland interconnector, the subsequent economic assessment of the future gas supply options recommended by the Gas 2025 study proposed that we should await the outcome of the exploration of the Corrib gas field off the west coast before deciding on future gas supply infrastructure. This was a prudent recommendation which I readily accepted. In doing so I recognised that it was not an open-ended decision. New gas capacity will be required, and I will make a decision on this one way or the other in sufficient time to ensure that there will be no shortage of capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of a gas pipeline to the west. I received two different applications for pipelines that would bring gas to or from the west &ndash; other Deputies from that area also raised that issue. One is from BGE which has applied for consent to construct a pipeline from Dublin to Galway and onwards to Limerick. That would, in effect, complete a national ring main linking in with the existing grid. Enterprise Oil, one of the companies in the consortium involved in the exploration of the Corrib field off the west coast, has also notified me of its intention to build a pipeline from the west to link into the existing BGE network. Enterprise Oil is considering a number of possible pipeline routings.</P>
    <P>An important consideration is that under the provisions of the EU gas directive, competition is being introduced into the natural gas industry right across Europe, and the industry is expected to develop into a very competitive industry. In recognition of this, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 states that in relation to the provision of natural gas infrastructure the market should be able to cater for the investment needs of the sector. There is no provision in the plan for the funding of natural gas pipelines. In authorising pipelines, I can attach conditions relating to environmental efficiency and safety criteria. I have no function in determining the proposed route of a pipeline to be built by either BGE or private developers. Decisions concerning the construction of pipelines and routes are made by the players themselves on the basis of commercial considerations.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the development of the Corrib field will be much more clear later this year. The Corrib partners, Enterprise Oil, Statoil and Marathon, have indicated that they will make a decision later this year on whether to proceed with the commercial development of the field. If the field is to be developed commercially, this would postpone the need for a second interconnector. I am not prepared to impose unnecessary costs on gas consumers by giving approval to BGE to proceed with the construction of a second interconnector at this stage if it will not be required for a number of years. Before the end of this year, I will make a decision on additional gas infrastructure that will ensure that additional capacity is available when it is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> The question of the ESB's participation in the scheme was raised by Deputies Yates, Stagg and Higgins. The ESB, as well as any other party, can apply for network capacity under the scheme. I am cognisant of the ESB's dominance in the electricity industry at present. I also recognise that the EU competition rules must be adhered to. The Attorney General has advised me on aspects of this Bill, including the possible impact of the allocation scheme on the development of competition in the electricity industry. In particular, he advised that in allocating capacity to prospective power producers, the Commission for Electricity Regulation should have regard to competition criteria in selecting winners under the scheme. This is also the strong view of the EU Competition Directorate. In the context of the opening of the electricity market, this is not an unusual precaution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding combined heat and power which was also raised by Deputies, it certainly is not the intention to require smallscale CHP projects to participate in the allocation. I recognise that to do so would have the effect of curtailing the development of CHP and I am particularly enamoured that technology. I will be proposing an amendment to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>I refute suggestions that the Commission for Electricity Regulation was influential in relation to the policy aspects underpinning the Bill. This is not the case. The commission is an independent office and its role and responsibilities in the electricity industry are set out in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The gas capacity allocation functions given to it under this Bill are temporary and are separate from its normal functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will act in an independent manner in conducting the allocation scheme and selecting the winners. It will be bound by the provisions in the legislation which I am sure colleagues will appreciate are very detailed. I have every confidence that the commissioner and his staff will conduct this process in a fair, even-handed and professional way. The Bill aims to provide a solution to a short-term problem. My Department has consulted extensively with interested parties on the question of an appropriate mechanism for allocating capacity in the gas network. The scheme provided for in the Bill is a <Col N="711" /> transparent mechanism to select power producers to whom the available capacity in the network will be allocated. It will select those producers who will be capable of bringing additional electricity generating capacity on stream at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The second pressing issue the Bill addresses is the right to access and acquire land for the purposes of constructing natural gas pipelines. Anomalies exist in current legislation regarding the construction of pipelines. BGE must obtain my consent to construct a natural gas pipeline while private developers must give previous and reasonable notice to me of their intention to do so. In both cases I can require that the pipelines be built in accordance with certain criteria relating to environmental, safety and efficiency considerations. BGE has power to access and acquire land for the purposes of building a pipeline but private developers do not have such rights.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a number of parties are interested in building pipelines both within and to the State. The EU gas directive has been in force since 1998. It requires that all natural gas undertakings be treated on similar terms. Therefore I could not approve any proposal from BGE or a private developer to construct a pipeline in a case where BGE and private developers do not enjoy the same rights. The aim of the Bill is to remove existing anomalies. The Bill will make all pipeline developers, both BGE and private developers, subject to the same consent conditions and extends the rights currently enjoyed by BGE relating to access and acquisition of land to private developers. These rights are subject to the same obligations to pay compensation that apply to BGE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised a number of issues. Perhaps he digressed somewhat from the subject matter of the Bill but if I were wearing his hat I would probably do so too. I will endeavour not to incur the wrath of the Chair but maybe I could digress slightly to address the issues he raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>He spoke of peat stations, particularly those in his area. I am aware that the ESB has a programme on the future of peat stations that will see new and more efficient stations being built. The new IPO plant in Edenderry will be ready later this year. There is a future for peat in the generation of electricity. He also spoke about wind farms. I share his views on their meritorious nature. Deputy Higgins referred to renewables and the meritorious nature of these forms of electricity production. We are endeavouring to facilitate small micro type wind farms, community groups and farming groups. This is being looked at by a special strategy group, which I expect to report to me next month, on how we can deal with the constraints that exist in regard to furthering renewable energy sources, particularly those relating to the production of energy <i>via</i> wind <Col N="712" /> energy. I want to progress that and I am sure the expert group will have proposals on how to overcome the constraints that exist as regards planning, visual impact and other aspects.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins was concerned about the role of the regulator. The electricity regulator will not act in the capacity of regulator in the context of what is required in the Bill. He will act as an independent agent within the terms of the Bill. He was chosen to carry out the allocation because he is independent and not because he is the electricity regulator.</P>

      <P>Deputy Daly mentioned emissions from power stations. I recognise what he said. These are subject to stringent standards laid down by the Environmental Protection Agency with which the ESB must comply. I am aware there is ongoing research by the EPA aimed at minimising emissions from power stations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane raised the issue of Moneypoint being converted to gas. This is an option I recognised in my Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published last September. It will be addressed in the Government's climate change strategy that will be published by my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, in the near future. I thank Deputy Finucane for his kind comments on my efforts to have Sellafield closed down. I would term that our collective efforts to have an end put to that abomination.</P>
      <P>A number of other Deputies including Deputies Ring, Crawford, Perry and Neville made interesting contributions. They were all anxious to see the benefits of natural gas coming to their areas. We all aspire to that. Deputy Browne would like to see the grid extended to Wexford and the south-east.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that both the Department and I received a number of comments on the Bill from interested parties.

    <Title>Sex Offenders Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Information needs to be gathered from other jurisdictions, as well as our own, concerning the number of sex offenders in the country and their whereabouts. I understand the Bill cannot deal with retrospective issues, but there is a need for those who will end up operating it to have a bank of knowledge on the whereabouts of sex offenders here. In particular, they will require information on the whereabouts of sex offenders who have travelled to this jurisdiction from other areas.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning names, some time ago in Kilkenny a case arose concerning a sex offender who was known to the UK authorities and who travelled to Ireland. He committed the same offence in one county before moving to Kilkenny where he reoffended. As soon as he was identified he moved quickly from the Kilkenny area to another part of the country. Such a case demonstrates the essential need for establishing an historic database before we can implement this legislation. Perhaps the Garda Síochána could build up such a list and begin to identify these people's whereabouts. By interacting with agencies in other jurisdictions they could establish if any sex offenders have travelled here and remain here currently.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the responsibility of health boards and an increasing number of Bills before the House seek to place new responsibilities on health board officials. Perhaps it is now time for the Department of Health and Children to be aware of all these responsibilities and to begin to take stock of the type of qualified people they have to deal with the new issues and responsibilities that are emerging. There is a need to employ the skills of existing officials and provide them with an opportunity to understand the wide-ranging responsibilities they will have when the Bill is enacted. They are being asked to play a significant role in the operation of certain aspects of the legislation, just as much as gardaí are being asked to be aware of the whereabouts of these sex offenders. They will need to know what they are dealing with.</P>
      <P>It is a commonly held view that people involved in these type of offences will continue to re-offend. Their mind-set leads them to avoid whatever regulations are established to control the system. It will take some time for health boards and the Garda Síochána to trace sex offenders and insist on their co-operation in this regard. All sorts of rules and regulations will be broken, so more investment is needed for increased staffing levels as well as using the skills of staff who are currently in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous case in Kilkenny city highlighted the type of support needed by a family when one of their members is abused. That support is not forthcoming from the health boards as readily as <Col N="714" /> it should be. Such families receive some support but they have to fight for it. If they are outside the medical card scheme they may have to raise the matter with their public representatives. Non-medical card holders should not face such barriers. When something like this occurs the entire family unit is affected, and in that case it fell asunder. Support must be forthcoming immediately through an action plan to deal with the issue, but that will take some forward thinking and planning. Where such a case is identified, health boards and other State agencies should move quickly and effectively to deal with it. The family I referred to had to fight for every bit of support it received and as a result lost confidence in the services available.</P>
    <P>The family of missing woman, Jo Jo Dullard, did not receive any support or counselling. I am not saying that it is the Minister's responsibility but there would seem to be pressure on the health boards as regards delivering such services.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions of Part IV under which the sex offender must make his offence known when seeking employment which would bring him into contact with children in an unsupervised capacity. That section of the Bill should be re-examined. Psychological reports from professionals in this field clearly state that sex offenders will re-offend. If that is the medical evidence, we should not allow a sex offender to come into contact with children without supervision, thus putting him in a position where he may re-offend. We will have to tease out that part of the legislation on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We should also look at Section 21 which provides for a maximum penalty of £1,500 and or 12 months imprisonment on summary conviction, and for a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The prison terms should be extended along with the financial penalties.</P>
    <P>I agree with post-release supervision of sex offenders and that their movements and work patterns should be restricted. On the other hand, we should also examine how we can deliver some sort of service to sex offenders that may help them to understand the nature of their crimes. They should be offered assistance and direction to remove them from that category and ensure they are put on the right road. That all-encompassing work should be done through State agencies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister. It is no harm to note just how many times the Minister has been involved in effectively, constructively and efficiently putting legislation through the House this week. Both the Minister and his officials must be working around the clock. I commend them on the work being done by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill. As the Minister said, it is a cornerstone of legislation in this area and it is absolutely necessary. He stated that its provisions are tough and uncompromising, and he <Col N="715" /> makes no apology for that. The Minister stated that this House must send out the strongest message possible to those in our community who prey on the vulnerable, those unable to defend themselves, and our children. He went on to state that the message at the heart of the Bill is that the criminal justice system must not tolerate the behaviour of these people, that it will deal with them swiftly and severely and that the public will be protected from their vile activities. I will return to that aspect later.</P>
      <P>As a result of raising an issue in this Chamber some time ago, I have had many representations on what the Minister can do to bring these issues to court. That would be in the best interests of not only the victims but of the families concerned. People should not be allowed to use the legal or any other system to prolong a case or to prevent it going to court. If the defendant is guiltless, the court will determine that and the case will be over that much quicker. The point the Minister made about these cases being dealt with swiftly cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he took no pleasure in having to introduce the Bill. None of us takes pleasure in coming in here to discuss it. It is a problem that none of us at this level realised was so severe.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the central purpose of the Bill was to impose requirements on certain sex offenders to notify the Garda. That is important. He went into that aspect in detail so there is no need for me to address it further other than to welcome it. The need to provide legal advice for victims or groups of victims is mentioned in the Bill. That is also very important.</P>
      <P>For many people the Brendan Smyth case was the one that rocked the system. It brought out into the open not only many of the desperate acts that had occurred over the years but it made us all more aware that changes were needed and that certain matters had to be dealt with. The constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is no different from any other. We have a number of cases and, unfortunately, our State solicitor does not seem to be able to get involved in all cases because of family knowledge or whatever. I understand it is legally possible for such cases to be heard outside the local area. That should be examined more closely. If all victims had proper legal advice, these cases could be heard by juries in Dublin, Dundalk or elsewhere which have no knowledge of the families or the schools involved. That would be much less trying on all the people concerned. In one case, not only was the State solicitor not able to defend the victim, he was also a witness on behalf of the defendant. There are various areas of conflict that need to be examined urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned previously in the House the fact that cases were adjourned 19 or 20 times in courts. The law in this area must be tightened. If a person seeks an adjournment, he or she must show adequate proof that the adjournment is justified, by producing a health certificate or other<Col N="716" /> wise. Is it not right that the system should be abused in that way.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a person today who is involved in a case which began in April 1996 and has not yet been heard. That is not in the best interests of justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. The case may be heard later in the year but some other quirk in the system might prevent that happening. Another case I know of started in February 1995 and only recently came before the court. That should not happen in a court of justice. Another person told me she took the witness stand on a Tuesday where she was advised she would not be heard until the Wednesday. She spent three and a half hours in the court on Tuesday, four and a half hours on Wednesday and four hours on Thursday. There was no contact between the victim and either the State solicitor &ndash; in that case it was the acting State solicitor &ndash; or the barrister. Is that satisfactory in the year 2000?</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the gardaí, in most cases, are very helpful. Victims have to employ their own solicitors to get information and advice but those solicitors are not allowed into the court. That is very unfair. The Bill will change that to some degree, which is welcome, but we must be certain that victims as well as defendants have access to proper and adequate support.</P>
    <P>One group of victims suggested to me that a liaison officer should be appointed to ensure the victims are fully briefed at all times on their rights and the way the case is progressing. That suggestion would be of no use to others who want full legal advice. There is a deep yearning on the part of victims for advice and to know their rights. For instance, a victim has the right to speak in court on the day of sentencing but many are not told that by the State solicitor or by the DPP personnel. They seem to just sit in court as baggage that goes with the system, not as people actively involved. I am not suggesting that all people who claim to be victims are victims but they have rights and they should be looked after. That would be a step forward and the Bill provides for that to some degree, but I would like everybody to benefit.</P>
    <P>I was shocked recently to hear that a query was raised about how a certain case would affect the business of the person involved. What is the relevance of that? This was a sex abuse case and it should not matter whether the victim was abused by a person on social welfare or a person at the top echelons of power. The only aspect that should be taken into account is the damage done to the victim, if that has been already proved, and the length of sentence that should be imposed. The business or job of the accused is not relevant and I am shocked that it would even be discussed.</P>
    <P>We also cannot forget the area of treatment for sex offenders, which is mentioned in the Bill and in the Minister's speech. They are victims, to some degree, of the system. We should not ignore people who are found guilty and have to go to jail. It is important for their future and that of the community that they get proper counselling and <Col N="717" /> treatment. They are people with a sickness, although it might be different from having a sore leg or back. As the Minister's colleague, Deputy McGuinness, said a few minutes ago, the unfortunate fact is that they often repeat these offences. As far as I know, only ten people are getting treatment at any one time. This must be improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness also referred to the health boards. It is important the health boards have the necessary personnel and facilities to ensure there is full follow up treatment by health boards, social welfare and whatever else is needed to help these people. It is not sufficient to threaten them with fines if they do not give the information on their past, they must also be helped.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Part 5 of the Bill provides for the first time for post release supervision of convicted offenders by the Probation and Welfare Service. That is welcome. However, it is not enough to just make provision in the Bill. As I have said before, we brought in tremendous legislation in 1989 to deal with the possible causes of BSE. However, while that legislation was put on the Statute Book, no personnel were provided to ensure it was enforced. While we support the Bill in the main and applaud the Minister for going ahead with it, the necessary staff and supports must be put in place so that sex offenders will have personnel to help them deal with life when they are released from jail and the damage to their families will be minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the work of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on publication of this Bill to try to protect the public from sex offenders, especially the provision for separate legal representation for victims of rape. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the huge amount of legislation he has brought before this House and the select committee over the past two years, and I understand a large amount of legislation is being prepared to be brought forward. I say to them to keep up the good work.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome and very important legislation, which is especially designed to try to protect the public from sex offenders. I understand the Minister and his Department were aware of the need to introduce additional measures to support and strengthen the measures already in place so as to give the required added protection to the public from such offenders. It is important we send out a clear message to such perpetrators of sex crimes. The Minister is right to say they will go to jail and that on release from jail they will have to adhere to strict new reporting requirements. If they fail to comply with the law in this respect, they will be liable to further lengthy periods of imprisonment and-or substantial fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principles contained in the Bill. The new notification procedure, or tracking system as it is known, will allow for close monitoring and constant updating of records. I support this notification procedure and welcome certain aspects of it, such as that this requirement will <Col N="718" /> extend to any sex offender, those convicted here and those entering this jurisdiction from abroad. I also welcome the intention that the relevant State agencies &ndash; the Garda, the Probation and Welfare Service and the health boards &ndash; will undertake continuous risk assessment of those who are subject to the notification requirement. This is very important. Will the Minister outline the mechanism that will be put in place for such continuous risk assessment to be carried out?</P>
    <P>The system of post release supervision being introduced makes enormous common sense, in terms of the Probation and Welfare Service's supervision of convicted sex offenders and their adjustment in the community. The civil sex offender order will enable the Garda to apply to the courts for a sex offender order against any person whose behaviour, while not necessarily criminal, gives cause for concern. This should prove an important safety net or tool if such an order is breached.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we go far enough in regard to the employment of sex offenders. I appreciate the new offence, which is designed to prevent unsuitable people gaining access to children through the workplace where relationships are based on trust or fear, is important and warrants address. However, the arena is much bigger than just unsupervised access to children. There are many other areas where vulnerable people can face sexual abuse and where relationships in the workplace or elsewhere can be based on trust or fear, such as in hospitals or institutions. We are all aware of the recent appalling revelations of the horrific abuses that took place in some of our institutions. While a number of such abuses were of children and young people, not all of them were. I understand the Garda is investigating other areas where it is alleged sexual abuse took place, such as homes for the elderly, psychiatric hospitals and other such places. I urge the Minister to consult widely with those in his Department who investigated such alleged abuses and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, who may also be aware of such allegations of abuse, particularly in homes for the elderly and psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the additional demands being placed on health boards by the new legislation. I have a fair amount of experience in this area from my input and involvement as a member of the former Eastern Health Board and the new Eastern Regional Health Authority, which I chair. I am probably one of the few people in the area who has visited every service provider and institution on a number of occasions. I am aware of the enormous difficulties service providers have in grasping the large number of welcome changes in legislation. However, the learning curve is great and they must tackle the issues arising from the legislation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, a great deal of this work is done in the courts. The presentation of cases takes up the time of people involved for days and weeks. Child protection cases and <Col N="719" /> acquiring court orders require the greatest amount of manpower and skill. There is a huge throughput of those required to give supporting evidence, especially social and community workers and the Probation and Welfare Service. In recent years, there has been a yearly allocation to fund projects. Perhaps the Minister and his colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance could draw up a long-term strategy on the likely skills and personnel required to respond adequately to enacted and proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Most of the committed and genuine people working in this area who would like to respond to this legislation can only adequately do so if support is available. They are having grave difficulties in this regard which is why I support the previous speakers, Deputies Crawford and McGuinness, who referred to the demands on these services. In light of that and my experience of those demands, I ask the Minister to formulate a long-term strategy and find out from personnel officers, chief executive officers and board members how much staff they require. It is difficult to find qualified staff who are knowledgeable about all areas of child care. Those charged with the responsibility of employing such staff should be informed that appropriate support and funding will be made available to ensure there are adequate numbers to respond to the demand placed on such services. I asked the Minister to outline how the risk assessment procedure will operate. This is an important feature of this Bill and perhaps he will come back to me on that issue.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to support for victims of sex abuse. I was somewhat disturbed recently when an Opposition colleague brought to my attention that a person known to him had been a victim of abuse and wanted to avail of appropriate counselling. This person had been abused, got on with life as best as she could and many years later found it too much of a burden and sought counselling. She was working, had a relatively small wage but did not qualify for a medical card. She could not avail of free counselling and in her own best interest had to pay for private counselling. This was a huge cost from her salary but because she was earning, she was not entitled to any assistance from the community welfare officer which would normally apply.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Crawford who referred to the importance of counselling and support for victims and their families. This is a regrettable vacuum. While I welcome this attempt at protection for the public from sex offenders, the remit is wider. I ask the Minister, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance to give special attention to these problems which can be easily resolved if the will is there. A number of Members have first hand experience of the obstacles creating huge problems in communities which warrant pragmatic action. I ask the Mini<Col N="720" /> ster to seriously consider some of the points myself and other Members have raised.</P>
    <P>One of the most important provisions in the Bill is separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases. This provision is innovative. I would like to be able to say to someone who wished to pursue a rape charge that he or she would not have to be vigorously questioned on his or her sexual activity, either with the alleged perpetrator or in their past. Those of us who have the opportunity to speak to victims know some of them will walk away from the complaint rather than pursue it because of that issue. I would like to think the innovative approach of the Minister will help complainants to overcome such obstacles and their horrific experiences.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the increase in the number of sexual assault cases and the tendencies identified with them. I have undertaken some work on the facts and figures which have been brought to my attention in this regard. When I have concluded my work, I hope to bring that information to the Minister for appropriate redress.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for the Garda Commissioner publicly to disclose operational guidelines on matters such as this. As regards stun guns, I am advised by the Garda authorities that these are not issued to gardaí and that, consequently, training in their use is not given to members of the force. I assume that the Deputy's concern arises from various comments which have been made about the tragic death of Mr. John Carthy in Abbeylara.</P>
      <P>The intensive investigation which is ongoing in this case has already involved interviewing about 200 people. The Garda Commissioner and I recently spoke about the desirability of securing outside expertise in connection with this investigation. Five FBI agents, whose expertise in the handling of the type of situation which arose in Abbeylara would be internationally recognised, are here and are assisting in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> It is not part of the role of these experts to conduct the investigation &ndash; that is a matter for the investigating Chief Superintendent. What they will do, however, is assess the handling of the operation as a whole by reference to international best practice. I expect their input will be reflected in the Chief Superintendent's report. The primary purpose is to ensure that any lessons that may need to be learned from this tragic death will be learned.</P>

      <P>I take it Deputy Higgins is referring to the tragic death of Mr. John Carthy in Abbeylara and I am on record as accepting that what happened there raises important issues of public interest. The House will know that the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Chief Superintendent to investigate this matter and central to that investigation will be the circumstances in which firearms were used by gardaí. I have said before and now repeat that I intend to make public the findings of that investigation. I ask that people be patient in the interim and await the outcome of the investigation; we will decide then where to go from there.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept that in a situation where a person is hopelessly outnumbered by a huge number of gardaí the use of HK 33 assault rifles and Uzi submachine guns is far in excess of what is required and that those weapons are the wrong ones to use? Those are weapons that are shot from the hip; they are not used to immobilise people or to effect an arrest. Is it policy to fire a warning shot in certain situations? Given that plastic bullets or stun guns are not available, does the Minister plan on making those available immediately? We do not know if a similar situation will arise in the future.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is the person who instituted the Abbeylara investigation, does he accept that one cannot have an investigation when a subordinate officer is in charge of investigating a superior? A Chief Superintendent is investigating an operation commanded by an Assistant Commissioner. Surely that kind of investigation lacks credibility and leaves itself open to question.</P>

      <P>I accept there is grave public concern regarding what happened at Abbeylara and an investigation is under way. I anticipate the results of that investigation should be available by the end of this month; at least I hope they are. While I have made it perfectly clear that the results of this investigation will be made public, it is unfair of Deputy Higgins to expect me or any other Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make public garda operational guidelines and procedures. That has not been done before and I will not engage in it. It has always been the case in this State and in others that matters such as this are kept confidential for obvious operational reasons. When the inquiry is to hand it will be published. We will see then where we go from there, but I cannot be asked to prejudge it and it is unfair of the Deputy to ask me to do so.</P>

      <P>I attended the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 29 May, 2000, at which the European Union Organised Crime Situation Report, 1998 was presented. The report was approved by the Council and it was agreed to forward it to the European Parliament for information. The report was compiled by Europol and provides a useful overview of organised crime in the EU and is helpful in determining the EU's overall strategy, policy and priorities in the fight against organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main conclusions of the 1998 report are that organised crime is growing throughout the member states of the European Union. All mem<Col N="723" /> ber states are concerned with the threat of organised crime and the activities of organised crime remain multi-faceted with differentiation in types of activities, markets, persons involved, crimes committed, and levels of organisation. The threat from organised crime groups from central and eastern Europe is of growing concern and there is also evidence of organised crime groups moving more into areas such as cigarette and alcohol smuggling, environmental crimes and high-tech crime.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding resources, the position is that my policy has been and will continue to be to ensure that the Garda have the necessary resources to enable them to do their job and the Government is increasing the resources available to the Garda. Never in the history of the State have the Garda been better resourced or equipped. Garda numbers have increased in the past three years by 600 members and are well on course to meet the Government target of a Garda strength of 12,000 by the year 2002.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Garda expenditure provided in the 1997 Estimates for the Garda Vote was a figure of £494 million; this year's provision is £668 million. The Garda fleet has increased from 1,350 to 1,900 vehicles, the Garda air support unit has become operational and an additional helicopter is being purchased. The Garda mounted unit has been established and a dedicated Garda patrol boat was launched in May, 2000 for use in policing the inland waterways. In relation to the resources provided for the Criminal Assets Bureau, since its formation in 1996, I am satisfied that an appropriate level of funding has been made available to the Criminal Assets Bureau to meet its requirements and its record to date bears this out. If further resources for the Criminal Assets Bureau are needed, I assure the Deputy that I will ensure that they are made available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Recent years have seen a major crackdown on organised crime. Legislation specifically designed to target organised crime has been introduced, backed up by tough law enforcement measures. I have put in place the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. This Act has also introduced a range of new measures designed to prevent the intimidation of witnesses, jurors, those who are assisting the Garda in the investigation of an offence and their families, and provides for a maximum ten year sentence for such offences.</P>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced while in Opposition, has been successfully utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activity from enjoying the benefits of their ill-gotten gains. This legislation and the operations of the Criminal <Col N="724" /> Assets Bureau have received much praise both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Specialised Garda units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the national bureau of criminal investigation have been established to combat serious crime and have had a major impact on organised crime. One of the problems facing all law enforcement agencies in their fight against organised crime is that these criminal organisations are now operating at an international level and are flexible enough in their operations to take advantage of any new opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, the response to organised crime must be an international one.</P>
    <P>As the report states, organised crime is growing throughout the EU and in this context, Ireland participates fully in the fight against organised crime at both EU level and beyond. At EU level, a range of measures from the 1997 EU Action Plan on Organised Crime have been agreed, with the intention of improving co-operation between national law enforcement agencies in order to tackle international organised criminal groups more effectively. Following on from this plan my Department has also actively participated in drafting the new EU strategy for the prevention and control of organised crime for the beginning of the new millennium which will ensure a continued co-ordinated response to tackling organised crime at EU Level.</P>
    <P>International agencies such as Europol and Interpol have an important role to play in dealing with international organised crime and the Garda are in regular contact with these agencies through the garda liaison officers posted to Europol and Interpol Headquarters.</P>
    <P>I will make arrangements for copies of the EU Organised Crime Situation Report, 1998 to be made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concentrate on criminal gangs in this State rather than international gangs. Will the Minister confirm he has submitted a report which states that there are 13 serious criminal gangs operating in the State? Will he confirm that seven of those gangs use legitimate enterprises to cover and launder their ill-gotten gains? Do any of these gangs have international connections and what specific action has he taken to break those gangs? In the wake of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the proceeds of crime legislation in 1996 we had expected them to be smashed once and for all. It is clear we will not end criminality, but it is a cause of concern to many people that 13 such gangs exist. I seek a detailed answer as to how these gangs are to be combated and smashed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The report concludes that Irish organised crime does not operate under the control of one organisational group. There are approximately a dozen major groups. They are well established and tightly structured. They are <Col N="725" /> involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and, to a lesser extent, the theft of computer components. These groups are mainly based in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>It can be said that organised crime in Ireland tends to be national in character with the absence of the involvement of a significant number of foreign nationals. However, some of these groups have contacts outside Ireland and this characteristic is featuring more frequently among Dublin groups. It is estimated that approximately 60% have contacts outside Ireland. These groups are mainly involved in illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>Irish organised crime groups are involved in money laundering to a significant extent. The continued buoyancy of the economy in general and the property market in particular provide criminal groups with increased opportunities to launder the proceeds of crime. Some of these groups can be involved in what appear to be legitimate businesses in order to launder the proceeds of crime.</P>
      <P>With regard to breaking up these gangs, some of the major gangs have been broken up in recent years. Organised crime still poses a problem for the authorities and the intention is to continue to pursue the gangs relentlessly. That is why the resources of An Garda Síochána have been increased in so far as and where possible. In particular, it is the reason the Criminal Assets Bureau has been so heavily resourced. In addition, as the Deputy will be aware from proceedings in the House over recent years, considerable legislative action has also been undertaken.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that from the beginning of the year to the 28 May 1997, ten murders and seven manslaughters were recorded. During 1998, 15 mur<Col N="726" /> ders and four manslaughters were recorded in the same period. The provisional figures for the equivalent period in 1999 are 17 murders and two manslaughters and during the same period in 2000, a total of 21 murders and three manslaughters were recorded. Of the 21 murders in 2000, proceedings have commenced in 11 cases. I cannot be more specific than this and the Deputy will understand that I do not wish to say anything that might prejudice the outcome of Garda investigations or future prosecutions in any of these cases.</P>
      <P>While I am concerned about the number of violent deaths, we continue to have a relatively low homicide rate in terms of international comparisons. Furthermore, I do not believe firm conclusions can be drawn from the statistics at this stage. For example, the murder rate in the last two years was lower than in the previous two.</P>
      <P>There is no point attempting to categorise these crimes in any superficial manner nor will I speculate as to the motives behind them. I do not wish to jeopardise the successful investigation and prosecution of these serious crimes by making any comment as to the motives that lay behind them. The identification of the motive and the gathering of evidence on these crimes are key elements of the investigation and prosecution functions.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, that there is particular concern about what are referred to as gangland killings, even if some cases portrayed as such initially, in this House or elsewhere, may turn out to be nothing of the kind. In this context, I have continued to afford the highest priority to the targeting of drug trafficking and related criminal activity. The Deputy will be aware of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime and the continued aggressive policy which is being pursued by the Garda Síochána to bring drug traffickers before the courts. This has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major criminals.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the background to any particular case, murder is murder and no effort is spared in bringing the perpetrators to justice.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister not accept that one of our problems is that we simply do not face up to the fact that there is a crisis in society? There have been 21 murders since the beginning of the year, a record number. People have died in all types of circumstances. They have been kicked and beaten to death, stabbed to death and shot. There is domestic violence, street violence and gangland killings. Marion Finucane's radio programme has highlighted a huge number of unprovoked attacks on people going about their daily business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a crisis with violence in Irish society. We need to examine, in a structured and scientific manner, the reasons so many people are resorting to violence to get their way or to resolve disputes.

      <P>Current Irish statistics compare favourably with those of other countries. In 1998, for example, the rate of homicide per 100,000 of the population was 1.41 and compared to other EU states the Irish rate was fifth lowest. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in both 1998 and 1997, the last years for which statistics have been published, 38 murders were recorded and 34 were detected in each year. The number of murders recorded over the past two years is lower than the number recorded in 1995 and 1996, which were 43 and 42 respectively.</P>
      <P>I note with satisfaction that the detection rate has also improved. Of the 43 murders recorded in 1995, for example, 32 were detected. In 1998, however, of the 38 murders recorded, 34 were detected. The manslaughter statistics for 1998 show a significant reduction on the previous year's figures. In 1998 six manslaughters were recorded, all of which were detected. This compares with a total of 16 which were recorded and detected in 1997.</P>
      <P>It is of no consolation to the families of those who have died in violent circumstances, but the House will be interested to note that the Irish murder rate is among the lowest in Europe.</P>

They have carried out six gangland killings since the beginning of the year and there have been 18 gangland killings in the past 20 months. With regard to the 13 gangs, if we know who they are, where they are and what they are doing, why are they not out of business? Why are the shutters not pulled down?</P>
      <P>It is fine to talk about additional resources for the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Síochána and the national drugs unit but these gangs should be out of business. They should be stamped out of existence and their empires dismantled immediately. To say that one knows who they are, where they are, what they are doing and how they are trying to legitimise their ill-gotten gains is a frightening admission, yet we cannot do anything about them. We can expect other gangland killings over this and next weekend and the pattern will continue. We are into a spiral of gangland killings reminiscent of the days before the murder of Veronica Guerin.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is ignoring the record of An Garda Síochána in recent years in tackling organised crime. He also ignores the high <Col N="728" /> detection rate I outlined in reply to an earlier question. For the record, in the last two years illicit drugs have been seized by An Garda Síochána with an estimated street value in excess of £120 million. That is an extraordinary performance by any standard. The Criminal Assets Bureau has obtained interim orders on property to a total value of £7.6 million, interlocutory orders on property to the value of more than £5.4 million and has demanded almost £33 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity. Social welfare determinations and savings amounted to over £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>These achievements by the Garda Síochána and the Criminal Assets Bureau must be set against a backdrop of a 21% drop in crime rate over the period in office of the present Government. I reject any insinuation or allegation to the effect that the Garda Síochána is not being successful. The truth is the opposite and I assure the Deputy that in so far as organised crime is concerned in Dublin city or elsewhere, the Garda is vigilant in making sure it gathers sufficient evidence to bring these people to justice.</P>

      <P>I have been advised this morning by the Garda authorities that the current information available is that 4,667 members of the Garda Síochána have successfully completed an official driving course. There are also 2,646 members who have the permission of their chief superintendent to drive official vehicles. These members do not drive official vehicles on a full-time basis.

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept that it grossly irresponsible that 2,646 members of the Garda Síochána are driving vehicles in the course of their duty without any training whatsoever? These gardaí have just an ordinary driving licence. This is a departure from the old practice whereby if a garda wished to drive either an official or unofficial Garda car, one had to go <Col N="729" /> through two courses, an elementary and an advanced course.</P>
      <P>We all sympathise with the families of the two young gardaí who died recently in Dublin, both of whom were untrained. Will the Minister accept that it must become the norm that we go back to the old practice where every member of the Garda Síochána driving either an official or unofficial Garda car &ndash; one does not know what challenge they will meet or whether they will be called into hot pursuit within a matter of minutes of taking up duty &ndash; should be officially trained in the use of a car for Garda purposes while on duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice has been as I outlined for some considerable time. Divisional officers or chief superintendents have the power at present to authorise a member who is a holder of a class B driving licence to drive official cars and vans, subject to the member being otherwise deemed suitable. I stress this only applies to a car or van. Members who have been issued with a certificate of competency, having completed an appropriate driving course, may also be authorised by divisional officers or chief superintendents to drive official vehicles. The certificate of competency allows a member to drive official vehicles where he or she has completed a course for that particular vehicle.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the number of gardaí is increasing in line with accelerated recruitment as part of Government policy. In those circumstances, the number of vehicles in the Garda fleet is also increasing. The fact that members who hold a current class B driving licence may, with the permission of their chief superintendents, drive official cars is of considerable assistance to the Commissioner from an operational point of view. It is not practical to do precisely what Deputy Higgins requests. However, courses are available at the Garda College in Templemore and, in so far as these can be made available to people who wish to participate in them, they are. There is an operational question which each chief superintendent must decide for him or herself. To be honest with the Deputy, I am in a position to trust their judgment.</P>

These gardaí may be expected to pursue a car travelling at over 100 m.p.h. Incidentally, the car involved in the unfortunate tragedy to which I referred had 110,000 miles on the clock. Is the Minister aware that there is a lot of disquiet among senior and rank and file gardaí that they are not being provided with adequate training? It is not good enough to say the course is available. The course should be mandatory and compulsory, not just available. Is the Minister in a position to inform the House that he will insist that within a specified period both the elementary and advanced course will be made available to all gardaí on public duty driving vehicles authorised by chief superintendents?</P>

      <P>I find it extraordinary that senior members of the Garda Síochána should have gone to Deputy Higgins in this regard. I have been Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for almost three years and this matter was never raised with me. It is regrettable that there were three tragic fatal accidents involving gardaí on duty in Wexford, east Dublin and west Dublin. In two cases the drivers involved were driving with the authorisation of chief superintendents. In the other instance, the driver had completed successfully a car course. Out of respect for the sensitivities of the families concerned, I do not propose at this stage to go into detail on the accidents.</P>
      <P>However, the situation is as I have outlined. From time to time, the chief superintendent of a given division makes a decision to the best of his ability based the information and knowledge available to him. Obviously people are picked from divisions depending on the number of cars available to carry out driving courses in Templemore. It is not feasible at present to provide the kind of training requested by Deputy Higgins, that is, making training available to every member of the force who wishes to obtain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>All the available facts surrounding this case have been outlined to this House by me on several occasions over the past year or so and are in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the House on 1 April 1999, I decided at the time that official level inquiries should proceed, conducted in such a way as not to jeopardise the upcoming judicial review proceedings. An inquiry was instituted by the Chief Justice which resulted in a report forwarded by <Col N="731" /> the Chief Justice to the Attorney General who passed a copy to me. A departmental inquiry was carried out into the involvement, if any, of officials in this matter and a report was provided to me. The Chief State Solicitor's Office carried out an internal inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Government approved the release of the Hamilton report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. My Department also forwarded a copy of the departmental report to that committee. I have also explained to the House that, on the basis of various contacts which took place at the time, the DPP was of the view that a criminal investigation would, in all the circumstances, be premature and that view was shared by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>Since that time, the outcome of the investigations I have mentioned have not only been in the public domain but have also been available to the Garda authorities and the DPP. It is a matter for the Garda authorities to decide in any case whether, on the basis of the facts and information available to them, there ought to be a criminal investigation. It is a matter for the DPP to decide, on the basis of any Garda investigation file that may be presented to him, whether anyone should be the subject of a criminal prosecution. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no role nor can he or she intervene in that process and the Deputy will agree that this is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The position in this case, as in any other case, is that if any specific allegation of criminal conduct is made to the Garda authorities and if the person making the allegation can provide the Garda with a credible basis for making that allegation, the matter will be investigated. It is my understanding that to date no such allegation has been made.</P>

Is the Minister saying this was the last chapter in this debacle? I put it to the Minister that the application of the rule of law in this affair was so flexible as to be seriously compromised. Is the Minister saying he has been satisfied that the impartiality of the courts has in no way been compromised?</P>

The Chief Justice is the chief law officer of the land and he was asked to carry out the inquiry. He brought his conclusions to the Government, they were considered and the Government took what it considered was appropriate action. There was little more I could have done &ndash; I did what I had to <Col N="732" /> do. If Deputy Flanagan or anybody else is of the view that there should be a Garda investigation then I suggest they produce their reasons for that to An Garda Síochána and I have no doubt the matter would be investigated.</P>

I ask the Minister to elaborate on exactly what was that stated misbehaviour. This happened over a year ago and we still do not know. Is the Minister satisfied as to the nature of this misbehaviour?

The Government, through the Secretary General, subsequently wrote to the two judges concerned and both resigned; that is well known.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, judges are appointed by the President acting on the advice of the Government. Since the Government came into office a total of 29 appointments have been made to the various courts of which four were women. Three of these women were new appointees to the Bench. The procedures laid down in Part IV of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, involving the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, were followed in all cases. The full details are as follows: the Supreme Court &ndash; four appointments, of which two were new appointees to the Bench and two were promoted from the High Court; one of these judges is a woman; the High Court &ndash; ten appointments, of which eight were new appointees to the Bench and two were promoted from the Circuit Court; one of these judges is a woman; the Circuit Court &ndash; five appointments, of which three were new appointees to the Bench and two were promoted from the District Court; one of these judges is a woman; the District Court &ndash; ten appointments, of which one is a woman.</P>
      <P>In addition, appointments have been made to the Offices of Chief Justice, President of the High Court and President of the Circuit Court, all from within serving judges of their respective courts.</P>

      <P>We have two women judges in the Supreme Court for the first time in the history of the State. I dare say this compares favourably with many other countries, and I wish to say how distinguished both judges are. We have two women High Court judges, again distinguished people, and another woman judge of that court was appointed last year to serve on the European Court of Justice, the first woman to be appointed to that court from any member state. We have five women Circuit Court judges and nine women District Court judges, all of whom are distinguished.</P>
      <P>The Government does not have a free reign in the matter of judicial appointments. The Deputy will be aware that under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, the Minister is supplied with a list of recommended names for judicial appointment from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. Neither is it particularly useful to look at trends over relatively short time periods or to draw inferences from that exercise as to whether women are being treated fairly in the matter of judicial appointments. What is clear is that the situation has improved and that it is incumbent upon all of us to do all we can to ensure that in this and all other areas we leave no grounds for suggestions of discrimination on the basis of sex.</P>
      <P>We must also realise that, so far as I am aware, the number of male senior counsel available for appointment to the Bench in the Law Library far outweighs the number of females.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of proportionality in terms of gender is one which is dear to my heart, and I would like to see a far greater degree of participation of women in posts of responsibility in the State. That is not to say there are not many women in <Col N="735" /> posts of responsibility, there are, but in the higher grades of the Civil Service and in the Judiciary we could have a far greater proportion of women. In so far as we can we try to adhere to the guidelines to which Deputy Howlin referred, 40% is the norm. This can be very difficult in terms of the appointment of judges because the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board puts forward the names&mdash;</P>

The procedure is that the Judicial Appointments Commission is written to to put a number of names before the Minister of the day who decides the name to be recommended to the Government. In the case of the Supreme Court, as in the case of other courts, it is possible for promotions to take place. Normally &ndash; not always &ndash; Supreme Court vacancies are filled from the ranks of sitting High Court judges. There has been at least one appointment however in recent times where the person concerned &ndash; a very distinguished judge &ndash; came straight out of the Law Library as a senior counsel and into the Supreme Court.</P>

Between 1 January and 31 March this year 40 persons were arrested for credit card fraud, of whom 32 were charged.

      <P>In the case of fraud perpetrated on the Internet or in an on-line environment the existing set of laws supplemented by future legislative measures, as appropriate, will be used to investigate and prosecute such offences. I understand section 26 of the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, creates new offences in relation to electronic signature fraud and that the fines for such offences could amount to £500,000 or five years in prison. One would not want to be depending on the minimum wage to pay a fine of that nature. I am informed by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that credit card issuers provide certain protection for cardholders who are the victims of fraud. Where a consumer reports the theft of his or her card to the credit card issuer a block is put on further use of the card. Where a transaction is entered into improperly before the theft is notified to the credit card issuer the consumer will normally be expected to bear a certain amount of the cost.

The Garda bureau of fraud investigation is the specialist agency with responsibility for the investigation of fraud related crime nationally. There is a cheque-credit card fraud unit within the bureau which concentrates on the more serious cases of cheque and credit card fraud with less serious cases being referred to local Garda stations for their attention. I understand that since early 1998 the bureau has had to deal with complaints of fraud involving cheques and credit cards by non-nationals. As with all other complaints of credit card fraud these complaints are fully investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>

Other relevant Departments are also represented. All the social partners were at the table &ndash; ICTU, IBEC, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the farming organisations. Most important, the research was done by the Employment Equality Agency so the Equality Authority, which replaced the agency, is at the table along with the Health and Safety Authority. There is no doubt that all relevant players are at the table carrying out an in-depth review of legislation. We have drawn to their attention the increasing participation of women in the workplace and it is important to review legislation at this stage. There is a deadline of September 2000 for the review group report. There is no point in us saying what we think the group should report. We will take its considerations on board when it reports.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that it has been the general policy of successive Ministers for Justice not to disclose detailed information on the nationality of asylum seekers. This is due to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants and the commitments given to such applicants that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence. As the number of applicants of some <Col N="739" /> nationalities is small, it could be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided. Such identification could have serious implications particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin. Accordingly, the infor<Col N="740" /> mation requested in respect of countries where the number of applicants is less than ten in any one year is not included.</P>
      <P>Subject to this, the information sought by the Deputy for the period 1991 to April 2000 is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

    <P>The largest number of applications for this year up to 30 April appear to come from Nigeria &ndash; 1,156. The next highest is from Romania &ndash; 1,150. The Democratic Republic of Congo is third highest at 143 applications, followed by Poland at about 99 applications.</P>
    <P>The total number of asylum applications up to 30 April 2000 is 3,848. The total for 1999 was 7,724, 4,626 in 1998 and 3,883 in 1997. There is no question but that Ireland's take of asylum applications from Romania and Nigeria appears disproportionately high compared to other EU member states.</P>

      <P>The figure for the year so far is quite astonishing. The Minister recently signed a re-admission treaty with Romania. Will he sign a similar treaty with Nigeria, Poland and the <Col N="742" /> Democratic Republic of Congo, as they are the four largest sources of applications?</P>
      <P>It is amazing that Poland is in the first tranche of applicants for membership of the EU, yet we have this difficulty with asylum seekers. One is tempted to ask what will happen when Poland becomes a member? Will Poles have free admission to Ireland as do nationals from other member states? Did the Taoiseach raise this issue on his recent visit to Poland?</P>

      <P>Last year there were 136 applications from Algeria, 101 from Kosovo and about 600 from Poland. I signed a re-admission agreement with the Romanian Government some weeks ago whereby people found to be illegal immigrants in this jurisdiction can be returned by agreement to Romania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> The Taoiseach obtained agreement in principle from the Polish Government that we would sign a re-admission agreement with Poland. The documentation is being prepared and we are exchanging documents. I will travel to Poland to sign a new re-admission agreement as soon as it is ready.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the Nigerian authorities. The ambassador is not available at present but officials have met officials of the Nigerian Embassy regarding immigration with the intention of commencing negotiations on a re-admission agreement. It is clear that Ireland should sign re-admission agreements with states where agreement can be obtained. It is far easier to return people to the countries from which they came if such agreements have been signed. It is more difficult to do so, for obvious reasons, if such agreements have not been signed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of the year, 29 Garda youth diversion projects were in existence. Last month, I announced the establishment of ten additional projects as the first phase of an expansion of the programme as part of the national development plan, bringing the current total to 39.</P>
      <P>Given the number of projects involved, I think it is more appropriate to list the location of each in a tabular statement which will be circulated with the reply, than to recite them here. In summary, however, the projects are located as follows: 15 in Dublin city, four in Cork city, two each in Waterford and Limerick cities, and one each in Tralee, Dundalk, Sligo, Bray, Ballinasloe, Navan, Tullamore, Athlone, Ballina, Drogheda, Ennis, Kilkenny, Killarney, Monaghan Town, Galway and Wexford. I expect to be in a position to announce the further expansion of the programme in two further phases later this year.</P>
      <P>In general, the amount of funding allocated for a full year to each of the projects is between £50,000 and £60,000. To date, only four projects are being allocated in excess of £60,000 &ndash; Tallaght, Knocknaheeny, Moyross and Ballybane. The final allocations for individual projects may be reviewed in light of development proposals and available funding. Five projects launched last year were allocated 75% part-funding under the European Social Fund, with the balance payable by my Department. As the funding from my Department is intended to cover the running costs of each project, the level of funding will vary somewhat from year to year and from project to project.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned a report carried out by the Children's Research Centre, Trinity College, on The Impact and Effectiveness of the Garda Special Projects. This study consisted of an in-depth evaluation of the 14 longest established projects. The report of this evaluation project, which was received in the past two weeks, is currently being studied by my officials. In general, however, the study found that the projects appear to be having an impact on offending and anti-social behaviour. The young people involved reported positively on their experiences and a majority reported a variety of positive learning outcomes.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> Projects supported by the European Social Fund are evaluated in accordance with ESF requirements. I also intend to institute follow-up studies on the effectiveness of the schemes established under the national development plan when they have been fully operational for a reasonable period of time.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is a strong view that these projects are of immense benefit in the communities in which they operate? Will he publish the evaluation report on this matter that has been received recently in his Department? If, as I suspect, the evaluation report accepts the value of these projects, will he ensure they are available in every community throughout the country?

      <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin that these projects are extremely beneficial. That is why we, in the Department, have tried to ensure we get as much funding as possible under the national development plan to tackle areas of disadvantage and assist people who, through no fault of their own, are disadvantaged.  In this context, it is the intention to establish the optimum number of projects within the financial resources available to us. An amount of £16 million will be made available over the life of the plan.</P>

      <P>Yes. We will take into account the priority areas agreed by our Department with the Garda community. Ten projects have been announced and further phases will follow. The total number of projects that will be established will be in the region of 30. As to the location of those projects, account will have to be taken of the requirements of the national development plan to ensure there is a regional balance, but there is scope for revising the total number in light of future demands. As the Deputy said, it is important there would be an evaluation of the projects from time to time and that such evaluation would take account of the specific needs of the participants. The need for intensive programmes and resource implications will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to make the evaluation report available to the Committee on Justice, Equality, Women's Rights and Defence. It is a case of horses for courses. These courses are extremely beneficial and can be extremely helpful in ensuring young people are diverted away from crime. Unfortunately, it is also true that there are people who have to incarcerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the current building programme, I outlined on a number of occasions there are a number of reasons it has been embarked upon, not least the current chronic overcrowding in our prisons. I would be the first to admit it is causing great difficulty. The revolving door system that has operated in our prisons for a considerable number of years must be terminated. The number of sexual offenders has increased. There is the question of the implementation of the bail referendum as passed by the Irish people which will result in an increase in the number of people who will be remanded in custody. It is necessary to ensure that children are given adequate accommodation in so far as they <Col N="747" /> come within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There has also been an increase in the number of female offenders, which has resulted in an increased demand for more female prison places.</P>

      <P>The Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, many of which are available to the general body of prisoners. These have the dual purpose to provide prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and to encourage and equip them to lead non-offending lives on release.</P>
      <P>The thinking skills course was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork Prison early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders including those convicted of domestic violence offences. The course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of the Department's psychology service. The skills taught in this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. It is anticipated that this programme will be rolled out in the Curragh Prison later this year and in other prisons over the next two to three years.</P>
      <P>The alternatives to violence project is run in a number of prisons. It is an experiential programme to help prisoners learn new skills, alter their attitudes and move towards leading fulfilling and crime free lives. The project takes the form of weekend workshops. The aims are to build self-esteem and trust, improve communication skills, develop co-operative attitudes that avoid competitive conflict and allow people to try out new and creative ways of resolving conflicts.</P>
      <P>It is widely acknowledged that addiction, particularly to alcohol, is a root cause of domestic violence. Addiction counselling is provided in conjunction with and by various outside agencies such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate aim of the Prison Service is to develop and put in place a wide range of rehabilitative measures that will be made available to all <Col N="748" /> prisoners, including those convicted of domestic violence offences. It is anticipated that completion of the prison building and refurbishment programme will greatly facilitate the provision of additional rehabilitative programmes for prisoners and the enhancement of existing programmes over the next two to three years.</P>

      <P>I contacted the director of the Prison Service on this query in anticipation of further questions Deputy Howlin might put to me, which at times can be difficult to anticipate.

      <P>Early last month I took part in a very comprehensive debate in the Seanad on various aspects of defamation law. At that time, I indicated that I was very aware of the immediate concerns the newspaper industry has in relation to this area of the law. I also made reference to past meetings with both the National Newspapers of Ireland and the Regional Newspapers Association of Ireland. Those meetings took place shortly after I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>As might be expected, I have received representations from the industry subsequent to that meeting and the NNI and the RNAI, as was reflected during my meetings with them, are broadly supportive of the recommendations for change in relation to the civil law of defamation, which are contained in the Law Reform Commission's report and which, to a large extent, are echoed in the Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. To that extent, there is common ground between us.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific recommendation of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry on the need for an independent press ombudsman, that recommendation was for the appointment by the industry at large of a person to act as an ombudsman who would have complete independence in the performance of his or her functions and who would be funded by the industry. Essentially, it is a matter for the newspaper industry itself and can be advanced outside the ambit of any proposed defamation legislation. I am aware that a link has sometimes been established between the industry's willingness to move on this matter and progress with changes in defamation law. However, I believe this linkage is overstated and I see no reason the industry, in order to engender confidence in the community at large in the integrity of our press system, could not advance the matter themselves at this time.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the Chief Whip at the beginning of this session, the Government's legislative programme contains a commitment to bring forward a Bill to reform the law on defamation. The heads of proposals for that Bill continue to be developed in my Department and the full details, when approved by the Government, will be announced in due course.</P>

What timeframe is envisaged? Will he accept that newspapers are considerably constrained in what they can and cannot do?

      <P>A considerable proportion of the Government's legislative programme, 40%, emanates from my Department. Having regard to the evolving nature of priorities some matters will inevitably progress at a faster rate than others. There is also the fact that recommendations for change in this area require careful study so that their impact on the delicate balance between freedom of expression and the right to one's good name can be assessed fully.</P>
      <P>In mentioning the tribunals and revelations there, one is straying on to other territory. It is clear the success of the tribunals in unearthing issues is due to the legislation brought forward to set up the tribunals. It is difficult to see how the evidence would have come to light without powers of discovery or the power to compel witnesses to attend. That is not to say I do not acknowledge the role of the media in this respect. I do and I have always had great respect for the fourth estate, although some members of the fourth estate might not reciprocate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is completing a review of the operation of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986, on the basis of recommendations for change made by the Garda Síochána Complaints Board in its reports and also on the basis of views expressed by the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, Garda management and by the Garda representative associations. I would hope, as a result of this review, to be in a position shortly to bring proposals to Government for amendment of the Act. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on these proposals until Government has made a decision on them, their general thrust will be to enhance the role of the complaints board in investigating complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, in its recent publications, <Col N="751" /> expressed the view that the resources at its disposal were of a level that has resulted in a significant increase in the time taken to finalise complaints. The complaints board, accordingly, made a submission to me seeking both an augmented staffing complement and an enhancement in the grading of staff with the board. The case made by the board was fully accepted by my colleague the Minister for Finance who recently sanctioned the additional staff requested by the board. These additional staff are being recruited and when in place, will lead to a significant reduction in the time taken by the board to deal with complaints.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Minister accept there is no public confidence in the existing Garda complaints procedures and that lack of public confidence is increased when a senior official, an employee, puts a major question mark in the public media concerning its operations? Can the Minister continue to stand over a system where the initial investigation of Garda misdemeanours is carried out by members of the Garda, in other words, gardaí investigating gardaí? When the report gets to the Garda Complaints Board what one is talking about is a report from peers, fellow members of the Garda. Given that the lack of confidence in Garda procedures is rupturing the relationship between the Garda and the general public there is an urgent need to reorganise, restructure and reform the existing Garda complaints procedures.</P>

      <P>I do not believe there is no public confidence in the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. I do not see why one television programme, if that is what the Deputy is referring to, should make up the minds of a mass of people that they should have no confidence in the Garda complaints board. There is every reason to have confidence in the Garda complaints board.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of the Garda investigating itself, I approached this matter with an open mind. It would probably be seen to enhance the independent status of the board if investigations into complaints were conducted by non-Garda personnel but that might be at the level of perception. I am not sure the introduction of non-Garda investigators, if that were to prove feasible, would make a substantive difference. It must be remembered that the gardaí are trained investigators and that members appointed to investigate complaints are of senior rank. They are as anxious any anybody else to see members who transgress properly disciplined. It is clear from the numerous conversations I have had with members of An Garda Síochána at every rank there is grave embarrassment when any one of their members lets them down.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Garda has complained in a recent Garda review that the delay in processing complaints to conclusion is delaying the administration of justice in many respects? There is an inordinate delay in finalising individual complaints. Long before any television programme I had been in receipt of complaints from the general public. Will he accept it is important for the maintenance of confidence in the Garda Síochána that the complaints procedure is transparent and that he has responsibility in that area?</P>

      <P>The board accepts there is a need for improvement. There is no question about that. However, I would not accept the view of those who would like to see the representative of the commissioner removed from the board or who would wish to see alternative people investigate complaints. I have said repeatedly that the Garda itself is more embarrassed than anybody else when one of its number lets it down. Let there be no mistake about that. On the other hand, I am conscious of public perception in this respect and I am looking at the whole question of the operation of the board.</P>
      <P>The complaints board has made a number of recommendations for legislative and procedural change as has the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. I will look at all the suggestions made. I have yet to reach conclusions on the wide-ranging review which my Department has conducted on the operation of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act. Also I have to obtain Government approval for whatever legislative changes I may propose. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on it in any detail at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the Garda Commissioner's representative being on the board, I am prepared to listen to all-comers on it. It is, of course, a deliberate decision to have a representative of the commissioner on the board. The presence of a senior garda on the board gives access to the other members to a senior member of An Garda Síochána. However, there are counter arguments and I will examine them in the context of the review.</P>

How can the Minister justify that? What changes does he intend to bring about to improve the situation? I know members of the public who would not dream of contacting the Garda Complaints Board to make a complaint against a garda. They say there is no point. The Minister must change that scenario.</P>

I am rather surprised to hear anybody say that there is no confidence in the Garda Complaints Board. I do not accept that there is no public confidence in the Garda Complaints Board. The board itself has come forward with certain recommendations and a review is ongoing. I have an open mind in relation to certain matters which I will definitely look at to see whether I can alleviate the concerns of what I consider to be a minority in relation to the board. Deputies Deasy, Howlin and Higgins have made their point. I assure them that what they said will be taken account of in the review. I cannot go into the minutiae of the proposal because I have to get Government approval. The Deputies have served in Government and they know what that means.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their kind remarks and I express my appreciation to those who contributed to the debate. Like many Members, I believe this is an important Bill and the tone and content of the debate was very constructive.</P>
      <P>Everyone will agree that words cannot adequately express the total abhorrence we feel about the misery and suffering inflicted on the countless victims of sexual abuse. There is probably no greater fear among parents rearing children here today than that their children will fall prey to sexual abuse. Understandably, there are differing views on how best to address this issue and all the views expressed during the debate will be fully considered before Committee Stage. The Government believes that this Bill will put in place strong protective measures for the vulnerable children and adults who are preyed upon by sex offenders. It reflects well on this House that there is such support for this Bill. Each of the measures in the Bill can be justified by reference to the threat which it is trying to address, and what is being proposed is proportional and balanced. At this stage, I would like to refer briefly to a number of the comments made by the many Deputies whose contributions ensured such a constructive debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Neville asked why I could not have accepted the Private Members' Sexual Offenders Registration Bill. This House debated the Private Members' Sexual Offenders Registration Bill in May 1998, just weeks before the publication of my discussion paper on the law on sexual offences. The timing of that Bill was clearly premature in that it pre-empted the outcome of a public debate, and would have deprived interested persons and groups of the opportunity to participate in the consultation process. It was worth waiting to have the benefit of those persons' views taken into account in the preparation of this Bill. The Private Members' Bill was also less comprehensive in its approach to the management of sex offenders in the community in that it concentrated on only one aspect, namely <Col N="755" /> the requirement to register, and even on that aspect I had reservations. It would, for example, to take up a point raised by Deputy Higgins, have exempted persons under 17 years of age from the requirement to register. My information is that such an exemption could result in some high risk young persons falling outside the notification requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins, and also Deputy Clune, referred to a lack of retrospectivity in the notification process because of constitutional restraints. In fact, because of the way I have approached the whole notification procedure in the Bill, an element of retrospectivity is present. The reason is that the notification requirement is a preventative and regulatory measure as opposed to a punitive measure. The degree of retrospectivity is limited only by practical considerations. Further retrospection would be impossible without compromising the accuracy of the records; it would simply not be possible to trace all those offenders no longer in contact with the criminal justice system. That is why there would be little point in going back over existing Garda records, as suggested by Deputy McGuinness. However, if such a person were to act in a way as to pose a risk of serious harm to the public, the Garda could apply to the court under Part 3 for a sex offender order and the making of such an order would automatically make the person liable to the notification requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Clune were not quite correct when they said that the Judiciary can decide who is subject to the notification requirement. The notification requirement is a preventative and regulatory measure as opposed to a punitive measure and will be an automatic consequence of a conviction. Seeing as it is almost impossible to predict whether or when most convicted sex offenders will pose a further threat, I considered it appropriate that all would be subject to the notification procedure rather than trying to predict the risk they would pose in the future based on a sliding scale of probabilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville was, however, correct in saying that the Bill is silent on disclosure, a point also raised by Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald. This is far too sensitive an issue to attempt to legislate for. Instead, the Garda, in consultation with other interested State agencies such as the Probation and Welfare Service, will undertake continual risk assessment. Information will be disclosed to other persons only in the most exceptional circumstances in order to prevent an immediate risk of crime or to alert members of the public to an apprehended danger, and then only on a strict need to know basis. Even then it will be a measure of absolute last resort when it may be the only remaining option for preventing abuse. Administrative arrangements will be put in place to this end that will protect the public and, in particular, children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Antipathy towards sex offenders, in particular paedophiles, runs high. It is difficult to believe that the diffusion of knowledge about their location would not result in, at best, unhelpful public hounding of convicted paedophiles from one locality to another, and, at worst, in violence and disorder, thus discouraging notification to the point where the purpose of the Bill was defeated.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Clune asked how, for example, a sporting organisation or a community group could check whether a prospective employee was a convicted sex offender subject to the notification requirements. In discussing this, it is important that we do not confuse two separate systems with different purposes. Since 1994 there have been arrangements in place whereby the Garda Síochána carry out clearance checks in respect of full-time employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults. These arrangements, which were introduced in response to allegations of abuse of children in residential care centres, are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advices received in the matter from the Attorney General. A practice had developed whereby employers of prospective employees not coming under the above formal arrangement were, with the written consent of these employees, requesting the Garda for copies of personal data relating to the individuals concerned under section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988. I was informed by the Garda authorities that they were advised by the Data Protection Commissioner that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, did not provide for the disclosure of personal data to third parties, irrespective of whether or not the individuals in question had consented to allow the Garda authorities to respond to the prospective employer and that the Garda authorities, on the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner, had ceased to do so. The Attorney General subsequently advised that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, was not designed for, and is not appropriate for, use as a vehicle for police clearance.</P>
    <P>The fact there are a large number of organisations with responsibility for child care who engage staff, ranging from full-time paid staff to voluntary staff, who are not currently covered by the existing Garda clearance arrangements for full time employees in the health care area is a matter of concern to me and I would wish to see these arrangements extended as quickly as possible to cover any person who would have regular unsupervised contact with children or other vulnerable persons, irrespective of whether or not in a health care setting.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Garda Commissioner commenced a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in the child care area generally. He established an internal working group to recommend improved clearance arrangements which would allow the Garda to respond effectively to the increasing number of requests to expand the <Col N="757" /> system. Arising from the recommendations of the working group, the Garda Commissioner has approved the establishment of an implementation group which will report on the practical and resource implications of establishing a new centralised unit to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the clearance arrangements that I have outlined will remain separate from the notification requirements under the Bill. The notification requirements will, however, help to ensure that the information held on Garda records in relation to convicted sex offenders remains fully up to date. At present, the address held in Garda records will be the last one known to the Garda, which is usually the one where the offender was residing when convicted. The new requirements will enable the Garda to maintain an up to date record of the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders which will be of great benefit in the prevention and investigation of sex crimes.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville, Clune, McGennis and Dennehy also mentioned reports of paedophiles coming here from England and Northern Ireland to escape registration in their own countries. While I cannot rule out that possibility, there is no evidence of which I am aware of a significant influx of paedophiles into this country as a result of registration requirements in other jurisdictions. In any case, this Bill will ensure that paedophiles from other jurisdictions who come here to escape registration in their own countries, or for any other reason, will receive an appropriate welcome from our criminal justice system if they fail to comply with our notification requirements.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville, O'Sullivan, Crawford and Fitzgerald raised the question of treatment for sex offenders in custody. Public discussion and commentary about this issue frequently implies that there is only one form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in Irish prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect. I should explain that there are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders in prison. All are aimed at enabling such offenders to gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling which is available in all of the institutions to every prisoner who wishes to avail of it. Counselling is provided primarily by the Probation and Welfare Service and the psychological service of my Department. The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme, which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme has been available in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since 1998 and will be introduced in the Curragh by the end of September this year. Staff are at present being selected to deliver the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The third intervention involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners. This is done on a session and a call-out basis as well in response to particular crises. The fourth intervention, and the one which tends to receive the most media coverage, is an extremely intensive offence-focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison. A similar arrangement will be introduced in the Curragh later this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Sullivan, Jim Higgins and Clune referred to the relatively low number of sex offenders released in 1999 who had participated in the group treatment programme at Arbour Hill Prison. First, it must be borne in mind that many of those released would have availed of the other interventions that I have described. Second, as I have told the House on previous occasions, the reality is that many sex offenders in custody are either unsuited to or are unwilling to participate in intensive group programmes such as the course at Arbour Hill, due to insufficient motivation, emotional immaturity or otherwise. Compulsion is not a realistic or legal option in such cases.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the Arbour Hill group programme in 1994, all sentenced sex offenders are invited each year to apply for a place on the programme. All applicants are interviewed by the programme delivery team to determine suitability. Various criteria are applied to determine the suitability of an offender. These include the type of offence, amount of sentence to be served, level of danger posed to the community on release and ability to cope with the demands of such a programme. I should explain that group treatment is very demanding on participants who are compelled to confront their offending behaviour openly in group sessions. Many sex offenders in prison are often unwilling to engage in such a process and some who may be willing do not have the emotional or intellectual capacity or maturity to do so.</P>
    <P>Central to suitability is the quality and perseverance of the offender's motivation towards treatment. The final decision as to suitability is made by the programme delivery team after careful deliberation and consultation with prison personnel who know the offender well. I have asked the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority. A multi-disciplinary working group chaired by the director general and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh Prison. The possibility of extending the range of multi-disciplinary group work programmes with sex offenders is also under examination.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective for the Irish Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range <Col N="759" /> of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the benefits to be derived from therapy. I agree, on the basis of research that has been done, that treatment can make a difference in some cases and is worth pursuing as a matter of policy but it would be wrong, in the light of present knowledge, to talk it up too much lest complacency sets in. One group of researchers put forward the argument that the effectiveness of offering treatment to sex offenders in reducing subsequent sex offending has been clearly established while another group argues that, at best, the effectiveness of sex offender treatment programmes in reducing recidivism has yet to be established and, at worst, the treatment of sex offenders does not work. While the treatment of sex offenders in Irish prisons will continue and expand, Deputy Higgins's very definite views may be premature. On the other hand, Deputy Clune's figure of 95% of hardened paedophiles reoffending, regardless of treatment, sounds on the high side. Perhaps that figure hinges on a definition of &ldquo;hardened paedophile&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Sullivan and Higgins also asked why judges could not be empowered to order sex offenders to undergo treatment in prison, particularly because they will have the power to order counselling as a condition of post-release supervision. The Deputies are not comparing like with like. For example, failure to comply with a condition of supervision will be an offence with criminal sanctions. More importantly, I do not wish at this stage to do anything that could compromise the developing plans of the prison service to provide a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies emphasised the importance of adequate resources to underpin the Bill and I fully accept that there is such a need. Extra resources will be required by the Probation and Welfare Service to carry out the responsibilities assigned to them under the Bill. The exact requirement will depend on the level of supervision to be provided and the use made by the courts of post-release supervision orders. Resources will also be required to provide counselling programmes as part of the supervision. Discussions will take place between my Department, the Department of Finance and the Probation and Welfare Service regarding the provision of extra resources.</P>
    <P>Deputies Moloney and Cooper-Flynn would like the ten days during which offenders must notify the Garda to be a shorter period. The cor<Col N="760" /> responding time limit in the UK is 14 days. This is one of the areas where I thought a deviation from the UK legislation was justified. It is a question of balance. I believe ten days is long enough for offenders to begin to reorganise their lives but not so long that they may overlook their obligation to notify or to relapse into their former way of life. We can argue whether the time should be seven, eight, ten, 12 or 14 days. I consider ten days about right. Deputy Moloney also mentioned that penalties for sex offenders and restrictions on them are more severe in other countries. I disagree with that assertion. Few countries have penalties that are more severe than ours and our criminal law governing sex offences is among the best.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Sullivan, O'Flynn, Fitzgerald and McGennis were concerned that the circumstances where separate legal representation will apply should be extended. I fully understand and share their concern. However, the legal advice available to me is that I have gone as far in this Bill in that respect as is constitutionally possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also made a case for victims of sexual crimes to be kept more fully informed of proceedings. A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to improve the position of complainants in the criminal trial process. These are set out in chapter 5 of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences, which I published two years ago. While improving procedures in the trial process is largely an administrative process, if anything can usefully be done in that area through amendments to the criminal law, I will consider it in the context of my general response to the views I have received on those parts of the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan was concerned about how persons convicted abroad will come to the attention of the Garda Síochána. Obviously, this situation is not as straightforward as in the case of persons convicted here. International police co-operation, which was also referred to by Deputies Fitzgerald and Dennehy, will be important and could be enhanced if other countries brought forward legislation along similar lines to this Bill. There is also the deterrent value; convicted paedophiles are less likely to come to a country where their very presence, if they do not comply with our notification requirements, constitutes a criminal offence. No other country of which I am aware has such a provision.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and O'Sullivan, while welcoming the Bill, argued that the Bill is not a complete solution to the threat posed to children. There are three places where children have been at risk &ndash; in the home, in institutions and on the street. While the Bill provides further protection against abuse in the latter two cases, it would be wrong to underestimate its potential effectiveness in preventing abuse in the home. Abuse in the home is not always by a parent, sibling or relative <Col N="761" /> or by a person without a conviction. It may be by a person who has befriended the parents to gain access to children in the home or it may be by a dedicated paedophile who takes advantage of a vulnerable single mother by befriending her and living in a common law relationship simply to gain access to the child. Where these persons have a conviction for a sexual offence, the requirement to notify the Garda of their current names and addresses will have a preventative and deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>The same Deputies drew attention to child pornography on the lnternet and its very real connection to child abuse. While it is no secret that there are difficulties in policing the lnternet, a number of initiatives I have taken make a significant difference. First, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, makes it an offence to distribute, produce or possess child pornography, and that offence covers such activity on the lnternet. That Act also criminalises the dissemination of information about the availability of children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation. Second, the lnternet service provider industry, with assistance from my Department, has established a national public hotline to process complaints of child pornography on the lnternet. Third, I established an interim advisory board to oversee and monitor the implementation of the system of self-regulation. Fourth, work is ongoing in the area of promoting safe use of the lnternet, particularly for children. Work to date has included initiatives undertaken by Barnardos and the Information Society Commission, as well as the introduction of specific lnternet safety awareness initiatives in schools co-ordinated by the national centre for technology in education in Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also spoke about child pornography, but having reread his speech I think he was actually referring to a different problem, that is, pornography to which children, and indeed others, may have access and which is highly visible in some shops. This matter was also dealt with in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences, and will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about Part IV of the Bill concerning the provision of information for employment purposes. I am not aware of a similar provision elsewhere and in drafting it we have had to take care that it complies with Article 45.2 of the Constitution which concerns a person's right to an adequate means of livelihood. It will operate as a criminal offence without significant resource implications. It is not, for example, intended to employ an inspectorate going around to employers asking about the criminal background of their employees. Neither is it intended to create an offence for employers to knowingly employ convicted sex offenders in jobs involving unsupervised access to children. If such an irresponsible employer exists, he or she might have <Col N="762" /> more to fear from the civil law than the criminal law. As with convicted sex offenders coming here from abroad, this innovative provision will have a major deterrent effect and it will not be difficult to apprehend people who evade their responsibility to inform their prospective employer when the new clearance arrangements are in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn was concerned that employers should be advised when one of their employees is convicted of a sexual offence. The Deputy will be aware that criminal convictions are a matter of public record and persons convicted of a sexual offence after applying for or taking up work involving unaccompanied access to children will be bound, under pain of criminal sanction, to inform the employer of the conviction. Deputy Fitzgerald asked if the employment provisions extended to voluntary work. The answer is yes; voluntary or non-paid work is provided for in section 25(2)(<i>c</i>).</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn also expressed some disquiet about the exemptions to the definition of &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo;. It is important to emphasise that all the offences referred to will remain criminal offences. We must, however, be realistic and keep our sense of perspective. It is not my intention to expand the notification requirements into areas where there will be little or no likelihood of subsequent danger to members of the public. It should be remembered that protection of the public from further abuse by convicted sex offenders is the primary purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sexual offences can range from serious sexual assaults to minor incidents, such as unwanted touching. Where the victim of a sexual assault is an adult and the perpetrator is not given a custodial sentence, the actual offence is in all probability relatively minor and does not, in my opinion, indicate a need for notification.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked where the Bill deals with sex offenders loitering outside schools. This was an example I gave when explaining how the new civil sex offenders order could be used in practice. Deputy Higgins gave some examples of what he described as lenient and inconsistent sentences for those convicted of sexual offences. While I cannot comment on individual cases, I would point out that the question of sentencing policy for sexual offences was addressed in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.</P>
    <P>Once this legislation has been passed, I will be examining the remaining issues addressed in the discussion paper, some of which were also referred to in the course of the debate, and if further legislation is required, I will request Government approval for its preparation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe thought that no sex offenders should be let near children, even where they are otherwise supervised. I can empathise with what the Deputy is saying but his point is unrealistic and could have constitutional implications. There are not many jobs where a person will never <Col N="763" /> come into contact with children at some time or another. In any case, where children are supervised there is little scope for abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady argued that sex offenders should pay restitution to their victims. I would argue that most victims would rather see justice being done, that is, by the offender being found guilty by the courts with an appropriate penalty imposed. It is up to the court in each case to decide on the appropriate penalty. One penalty they have the power to impose is to order offenders to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy referred to the use of electronic tagging for sex offenders. I have been monitoring developments in this area both in Europe and the USA very carefully. Extensive consultations abroad suggest that such systems as are available to date work best in the case of low risk offenders who are considered suitable for non-custodial penalties and for short periods of between three and eight months. I am awaiting the outcome of tests on what are known as the third generation systems which use satellite or telephone technology and in the meantime I can assure Deputy Dennehy that I will keep the matter under continuing review.</P>
    <P>I hope that covers the majority of points raised. This has been a generally constructive debate and I again thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, 1999, is a relatively short Bill whose primary aim is to tighten up on and reinforce certain provisions of the 1996 Act so that it will be more effective in accomplishing the purpose for which it was enacted. A central plank of the 1996 Act is the power which it gives for the making, by the High Court, of orders freezing <Col N="764" /> certain assets and possible eventual disposal of those assets for the benefit of the Exchequer. The court order may be an interim or interlocutory one. The former is a temporary measure and remains in force for up to 21 days. Where an interlocutory order is in force for seven years, the court may make a disposal order whereby the proceeds are paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. While the assets are frozen it prevents the person who had possession or control of those assets from disposing or otherwise dealing with them.</P>
      <P>A question which has been raised about the effect of an order freezing the assets is who is in possession or control of those assets following the making of the order? One interpretation which has been canvassed is that possession or control has passed to the member of the Garda Síochána or the officer of the Revenue Commissioners who made the application for the order. The implications of such an interpretation, if correct, would be to place ridiculous obstacles in the way of the effective operation of the 1996 Act and would be contrary to the purpose for which it was enacted.</P>
      <P>By way of example, let us suppose that the High Court, on the application of a member of the Garda, has made an interim order freezing certain assets, which would remain in place for only a maximum of 21 days, and that the Garda then applied for an interlocutory order. If the effect of the interim order was to transfer possession and control, for the purpose of the Act, to the garda who made the application, the question to be asked is, who is to be named as respondent in the application for the interlocutory order? It would be illogical to think that the garda who sought the interim order should now be named as respondent.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies would consider that resorting to the fiction that possession and control had passed to the garda would be wholly unacceptable in that it would mean that the applicant and respondent at the interlocutory stage would be gardaí. That is not the intention of the Act. When this interpretation of possession and control for the purpose of the Act was considered by the High Court, it had no difficulty deciding that such a construction would defeat its purpose. Having regard to the scheme and purpose of the Act, the court decided that possession and control remains with the respondent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the High Court has upheld the interpretation, which I believe is the only sensible one, I am advised that it is desirable that the matter should be spelled out unequivocally in the Act itself. Accordingly, in this Bill I propose to amend the 1996 Act so that it is stated therein that a person remains in possession and control of property for the purpose of the Act notwithstanding that it is lawfully in the possession of a member of the Garda or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners or is the subject of a court order pro<Col N="765" /> hibiting it being disposed of or being dealt with or being diminished in value.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes further amendments with the purpose of streamlining the operation of the 1996 Act. To this end it contains provisions which will permit the varying of court orders affecting assets so that certain disbursements, such as living expenses and tax liabilities, can be made as well as allowing applications to court in the name of the Criminal Assets Bureau in addition to, as at present, applications in the name of individual members of the bureau. The Bill also amends the 1996 Act in relation to tendering of evidence in the course of applications to court. It makes clear that certain information provided by a respondent in compliance with the terms of the 1996 Act may not be used in subsequent criminal proceedings against the person providing it. I will return to the actual provisions of the Bill later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will understand if at this stage I remind Deputies that the 1996 Act was the product of my own efforts while in Opposition when I brought forward the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill. The Government of the day had no option, given the public mood at the time about the activities of criminals who appeared to be beyond the reach of the law, but to accept my Bill, which was subsequently renamed the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>That Act was pioneering legislation in that it tackled the then well documented problem of criminals, who had no obvious lawful means of income, living lifestyles which were clearly beyond their known means. The Garda was powerless as matters stood to confront the often blatant display of illegally acquired wealth. The 1996 Act, for the first time, put the Garda ahead of the criminals in the battle to curtail their activities and to hit them where it hurt most &ndash; in their pockets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act achieves this by providing for the freezing of property which is the proceeds of crime through the grant of an interim or interlocutory order, the effect of which is to prevent any person from dealing with or disposing of or diminishing the value of the property. An interim order will remain in force for a period of 21 days. While under an interlocutory order the property remains frozen for seven years after which, unless the court determines that it is not the proceeds of crime, a disposal order may be sought. The moneys realised as a result are paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. There is also <Col N="766" /> provision for the appointment of a receiver over property which is the subject of an interim or interlocutory order.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has enjoyed considerable success in depriving criminals of the proceeds of their criminal activities. Since its establishment in 1996, and up to the end of 1999, it has obtained interim orders on property to the value of over £7.6 million and interlocutory orders on property to the value of over £5.4 million under the provisions of sections 2 and 3, respectively, of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded in excess of £32 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity, and social welfare determinations and savings amounted to in excess of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>The bureau is regarded by many people, both nationally and internationally, as a model operation. In its evaluation report on Ireland's anti-money laundering measures, the financial action task force concluded that in relation to certain measures, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau, Ireland has implemented an innovative legislative and administrative scheme, which could provide a model for other countries. Similarly, in its report on Ireland's mutual legal assistance regime, the evaluation team under the remit of the European Union's Multi-disciplinary Group on Organised Crime, concluded that the Irish authorities have shown that they are prepared to be innovative in their approach to international organised crime, and in particular, with the Criminal Assets Bureau, have produced a model for other countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>The fight against criminality, and drug crime in particular, has involved a number of inter-related elements. One such element is legislative, which has the twin aims of depriving criminals of the benefit of their illegal gains and of ensuring that when they are caught and convicted they will serve lengthy sentences. I have already mentioned the 1996 Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau. I should also mention the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which contains anti-money laundering provisions as well as provisions for the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and the forfeiture of property used in the commission of crime. The Criminal Justice Act, 1999, specifies that any person found guilty of drug trafficking, where the value of the drugs is £10,000 or more, will be liable to receive a mandatory ten year prison sentence. This measure was aimed at keeping off the streets for a considerable time those engaged in peddling the misery which is the drugs trade and sent a powerful message to anyone considering engaging in drug trafficking that they faced lengthy incarceration in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> Some statistics might help to illustrate the success which there has been in this area. During the period from January 1998 to December 1999, drug seizures amounting to an estimated street value in excess of £120 million were made. In the same period, Garda operations Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet, aimed at combating drug dealing at local level, yielded seizures of illicit drugs with an estimated street value of around £20 million and resulted in over 20,000 arrests.</P>
    <P>The second element in the fight against crime can be seen in the various initiatives which have been put in place to steer people, young people in particular, away from crime. This involves a multi-agency approach, bringing together a number of different agencies to develop and put in place a series of programmes to divert young people and help to re-build communities which have suffered most from the effects of crime.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies of the tremendous progress that has been made through the allocation of funding by this Government under various schemes. A figure of £10 million has been allocated on an annual basis, to support the implementation of over 200 projects proposed by local drugs task forces in their own areas. A further £15 million over a two year period was allocated in August last year to support the development of new service development plans by the local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated a sum of £35 million over three years, under the young people's facilities and services fund, to assist in the development of preventative strategies, in a targeted manner, through the development of youth, sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <P>The Department also provides funding for Garda youth diversion projects and there is £4 million available this year for the existing projects and the expansion of new projects. Recently, I announced the establishment of ten new projects throughout the country which will bring the total number of projects to 39. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides additional funding of £16 million for this initiative.</P>
    <P>These projects are operated by multi-agency management and advisory committees involving the Garda, probation and welfare service personnel, voluntary youth organisations, and representatives of local communities and are targeted at young people in the ten to 18 age group, particularly those who are seriously at risk of becoming involved in the drugs and crime cycle, who are already involved in crime or are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely. The projects aim to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal/anti-social behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal <Col N="768" /> development and encourage civic responsibility, and thus prevent crime and support Garda/community relations.</P>
    <P>The projects are currently being evaluated by external evaluators to assess their impact, to identify examples of best practice within the management, operation and organisation of individual projects and to identify the potential for improving links with other statutory and voluntary agencies which are providing related services in the same areas.</P>
    <P>On top of this funding, significant amounts are being made available to deal with the issues of social exclusion and disadvantage under the national development plan. In addition to the £16 million which I secured for the Garda youth diversion programme, I have also secured in the region of £70 million for additional crime prevention measures, including pre-employment training and personal development courses for individuals who come to the attention of the criminal justice system under the probation and welfare service, and labour market training for offenders while in prison, with the objective of breaking the cycle of crime and reducing the rate of recidivism.</P>
    <P>I have outlined these initiatives for the benefit of Deputies because I think it is important they are aware of the commitment of this Government to assisting people to contribute positively to society and, at the same time, to demonstrate our desire to defeat crime by advancing on all fronts simultaneously. I will now deal briefly with the details of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision. Section 2 makes two amendments to section 1 of the 1996 Act, which deals with definitions. The first is the term &ldquo;applicant&rdquo;. As I have already outlined, the Act provides that applications for interim and interlocutory orders are at present made by a member of the Garda Síochána or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners. In practice, these orders have been made in the name of the chief superintendent of the Criminal Assets Bureau. In addition to permitting the applications in the name of an individual, the Bill proposes that they should also be made in the name of the bureau itself. Under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, the bureau is a body corporate and it is only logical that applications should be capable of being made in its own name. The amendment permits this.</P>
    <P>The second amendment I propose to make to section 1 of the 1996 Act is to insert a new definition to make it clear that a person remains in possession of property, even where the property is in the lawful possession of the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners or is subject to an interim or interlocutory order, or where the person is otherwise prevented from disposing of or dealing with the property. I have already referred to doubts which were raised as to when a person may be said to be in possession or control of property for <Col N="769" /> the purposes of the Act. The advice I have received indicates that it is desirable that the 1996 Act be amended in this respect in order to remove any further doubts on the subject. This amendment provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes three amendments to section 2 of the 1996 Act, which deals with interim orders. The first is a technical amendment, necessitated by the earlier amendment, to provide for applications to be made in the name of the Criminal Assets Bureau itself. To this end, it includes the bureau as a body which may apply for an interim order.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to section 2 of the 1996 Act provides that an interim order may be varied by the court to permit the recovery of income tax, or other sums owing on foot of court orders. At present, section 2(3) of the 1996 Act provides that a respondent, that is, the person against whom the order has been made, or any other person claiming ownership of the property may apply for the discharge or variation of an interim order. Although the Garda Síochána and other specified persons could apply for a discharge of the interim order, there is no provision permitting them to seek a variation on it for the purpose of allowing certain disbursements to be made. The Bill's proposal meets that need and will enhance the effectiveness of the procedure by inserting a new subsection, subsection (3A). This will allow the court to vary interim orders on the application of the Garda, Revenue Commissioners or the Criminal Assets Bureau in order to permit the discharge of certain payments, for example, payment of court costs or income tax.</P>
    <P>The third amendment is a consequential amendment relating to the giving of notice to the respondent of applications for the discharge or variation of interim orders which are made by the Garda, Revenue Commissioners or the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the 1996 Act in three respects in relation to interlocutory orders. These amendments mirror those made by the previous section of the Bill, that is, they provide for applications in the name of the Criminal Assets Bureau, allow for the variation of interlocutory orders on the application of the Criminal Assets Bureau to permit the discharge of certain disbursements and provide for the giving of notice to the respondent of applications by the bureau to discharge or vary interlocutory orders.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the 1996 Act, it seemed to me desirable to address again the practicalities of the procedures put in place in relation to the tendering of evidence of belief that property is the proceeds of crime. In this regard I am at all times conscious of the need to balance the rights of the individual with the needs of the State. However, practical experience gained over the past few years has suggested that there are opportunities to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the <Col N="770" /> procedures, without encroaching on the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which is consequential on the amendment proposed in section 4, amends section 8 of the 1996 Act. At present, section 8 permits the giving of evidence by affidavit at an application for an interim order. However, it requires that such evidence must always be given orally at the interlocutory stage. In my view, this is not always necessary. Therefore, I propose greater flexibility in this regard by providing that such evidence may now be given on affidavit. At the same time, I recognise there are occasions when it is desirable for such evidence to be given orally, for example, to facilitate cross-examination. Accordingly, it will still be possible to have evidence given orally where the respondent requires it or where the court directs it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 also provides for the insertion of an additional subsection in section 8 of the 1996 Act to the effect that a document purporting to be issued by the Criminal Assets Bureau is to be deemed to be such a document, unless the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>Returning to section 5, the Bill proposes to extend section 6 of the 1996 Act by providing that any person affected by the freezing of property under either an interim or an interlocutory order may apply to the court for an order enabling him or her to discharge reasonable living and other necessary expenses. At present, while either the respondent or another person may apply to the courts, the Act confines itself to permitting only the respondent to discharge reasonable living and other expenses. This amendment will broaden the scope of the subsection to enable the respondent or that other person to discharge these expenses.</P>
    <P>Section 7, which amends section 9 of the 1996 Act, confirms that information provided by a respondent in relation to his or her property, income and sources of income, when required to do so by a court under that section of the Act, may not be used in evidence against the respondent or his or her spouse in any criminal proceedings, with the exception of proceedings for perjury of course. This is simply stating in statutory form what is, in any event, read into the Act by the courts to protect the right of persons against self-incrimination. Having examined the matter, I consider it useful to state this principle plainly in the Act, and I am taking this opportunity to do so. I would point out, however, that the limitation applies only to criminal proceedings and, therefore, it will not affect the use of information acquired under section 9 of the Act in other matters, for example, tax assessment.</P>

      <P>Finally, section 8 is a standard technical provision relating to the Title of the Bill when enacted.</P>
      <P>I believe that it will be clear from what I have had to say that this Bill contains a range of useful amendments to the original 1996 legislation. In commending the Bill to the House, it is appropriate that I pay tribute to the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

        <b>:</b> While the short technical amendments in this Bill are welcome, in that they help to streamline the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau, they also point the finger clearly at the performance of a Government which has failed manifestly to initiate any worthwhile new legislation to combat fraud or money laundering despite regular press releases promising tough new measures. The much vaunted, long promised fraud offences Bill continues to languish on the Government's list of promised legislation. Two years ago, banner newspaper headlines heralded &ldquo;Overhaul of Law to Tackle Escalation in Fraud&rdquo;. The article informed us that:</P>
      <P>New legislation is to be published by Justice Minister, John O'Donoghue, later this year to combat fraud which costs Irish business millions of pounds annually. The fraud offences Bill which will be a comprehensive overhaul of the law in the area on a scale not previously witnessed by the State will be in this legislation according to the Minister.</P>
      <P>That was in the early weeks of 1999, which has come and gone. We are now approaching the halfway stage of 2000 and there is still no sign of the bill.</P>

        <b>: </b>Absolutely. I could go on &ndash; the list is endless. In June 1999, this House debated what would have been an excellent Bill, in the name of Deputy Flanagan &ndash; the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill. It was drafted with the express intention of introducing a number of important changes in an area of the law which had remained unaltered and unaddressed for almost 100 years. Coincidentally, Deputy Flanagan's Bill would have been very topical in the context of much of what is now emerging from the Flood tribunal and the Moriarty tribunal in Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan's Bill dealt with bribery, the payment of secret commissions, payola and the misuse of information for personal gain. True to his gracious self, the Minister rejected Deputy Flanagan's Bill on the basis that he would be introducing a prevention of corruption (amendment) Bill. According to the Minister, his measure would be far-reaching and would cover categories of persons not covered at present. The Minister's Bill eventually appeared some weeks ago and the general analysis &ndash; not just an subjective one by those in the political domain &ndash; was that it is a pale reflection of what was promised. Not alone is the Bill far less adequate and comprehensive than required in the context of the corruption which has so besmirched Irish public and commercial life but it has still not received a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I welcome your presence in the Chair because I know you will do everything you can to support me on this important issue. I thank the Minister for coming to the House. The loss of one teacher in each of three County Monaghan schools is serious. The chairperson, parents and principal of St. Daig's national school, Inniskeen, roll No. 19251G, believe there are exceptional circumstances. Their letter states:</P>
      <P>Our enrolment on 30 September 1999 was 149 pupils. This was one pupil less than the required 150 which would have retained our teacher. Were it not for the unfortunate and tragic death of a pupil in June 1999 we would have had the 150 pupils. Coupled with this, a pupil who was to enrol in September 1999 was too ill to come to school at the time.</P>
      <P>The loss of this teacher will mean that a full class, less one pupil, must be divided among the remaining five classes. The present remedial teacher who is fully trained and who, since last September, is the school's first remedial teacher, will be placed on the panel. The teacher who must fill that vacancy as the next remedial teacher will come from within the present staff and will not be trained as a remedial teacher. This speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>The second school, Scoil na gCaíliní, Castleblayney, roll No. 16202B, had 119 pupils on 30 September. However, it now has 120 pupils. The chairperson, principal and parents do not understand why they have not been given disadvantaged status which they have sought for the past ten years. Their letter states:</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why Our Lady's secondary school, which is ten feet from our school, on the same campus, enjoys this status while we do not? Is this not blatant discrimination? Do we not &ldquo;cherish all children of the nation equally&ldquo;? We have no remedial teacher on our staff. We have no resource teacher on our staff. We do not have access to an educational psychologist. We have currently ten children awaiting educational assessment. In the relevant school year (1998-9) we had a child assessed who was subsequently sent to a special school because we could not support her education sufficiently. As a result of this we are now losing a teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> This school wants to be declared severely disadvantaged and to retain its teacher.</P>
    <P>The third school is in north Monaghan and equally merits the retention of its teacher. The principal, chairperson and parents of Scoil Naomh Pádraig, Emyvale, roll No. 18028V, have contacted all Oireachtas Members. On 30 September 1999, they had 204 pupils and will lose the services of a brilliant young teacher because of one pupil. They see this as a scandal. The school has campaigned for four years for a full remedial teacher to deal with 25 pupils. I have forwarded the principal's letter to the Minister and the Department in Athlone. It states:</P>
    <P>As a principal and father of three children attending Scoil Naomh Pádraig, I sincerely hope that our application to retain the services of Miss Sinéad McSkane will be looked on favourably in the light of all the above information.</P>
    <P>The letter covers the needs of the school and I hope the Minister will read this long and detailed explanation. The schools have asked Oireachtas Members to join together to ensure these teachers are retained. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, no longer has responsibility for education but I hope he will convey the needs of this area to the Minister for Education and Science. County Donegal is the most northerly county and has 100 miles of border. It has suffered most in the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Some 24 to 30 schools are in the same position.  It is very difficult to understand why three of those school should be in County Monaghan. Given the peace dividend, this matter should be considered. Each school is one teacher short and if the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle were in different circumstances he might like to speak about it, but I know he supports these schools in trying to have this problem rectified. I hope the Minister has good news, but if he does not have good news today, we will be happy to accept it at any time up to the recess. This is an urgent and important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House on this matter. As the Deputy will be aware, the staffing of a national school in a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream teaching posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is drawn up each year following discussions with school managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of St. Daig's national school, pupil numbers declined from 158 in September 1998 to 149 in September 1999. An enrolment of 150 was required to retain the services of the fifth mainstream class teacher. Scoil Chlochar na Trócaire, <Col N="775" /> Castleblaney, had 132 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1998, but this figure had decreased to 119 by September 1999. The school needed an enrolment of 120 to retain the fourth mainstream class teacher. The enrolment in Scoil Naomh Pádraig fell from 214 in September 1998 to 204 in September 1999, whereas an enrolment of 205 was needed to retain the seventh mainstream class teaching post.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science acknowledges that in all three cases the school was just one pupil short of the enrolment required to retain its existing complement of teachers. However, I know the Deputy will appreciate that the staffing schedule must be adhered to and that to make exceptions in cases where schools are just one pupil short would make the staffing schedule unworkable. The Deputy will also accept that in each of the schools there was a significant decline in enrolment between September 1998 and September 1999.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, based on their enrolments of September 1999, it is possible for all three schools to organise their classes in such a way that the average class size will be less than 30 pupils. In the circumstances, I regret that the terms of the staffing schedule must be applied and the Minister for Education and Science obviously is in difficulty in terms of making exceptions with regard to any of these three schools. I will undertake to convey the points made by the Deputy to the Minister. We will see what he can do after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue. I call on the Government to take urgent action to alleviate the severe crisis in the rented accommodation sector in Dublin. Radical measures are needed if a chronic homelessness, involving scores of people, is to be avoided.</P>
      <P>The number of people facing eviction and being forced to leave their private rented accommodation in areas of my constituency such as Rathmines, Ranelagh, Rathgar, Donnybrook, Ballsbridge and so on is staggering. There are many reasons for this and the overall housing crisis exacerbates the position for those in private rented accommodation. Financial incentives that existed before for private landlords to invest are now gone. Many multiple dwelling units were being converted back into private homes. There is obviously enormous strain on this sector from the 8,000 asylum seekers in private rented accommodation in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Dublin Deputies could give one example after another of problems in this regard. I cannot emphasise enough the appalling position faced by <Col N="776" /> families and individuals. Yesterday I spoke to a mother of three who faces eviction in mid-August from the flat she and her family have lived in for 11 years. The family has zero points on the corporation's housing list. Apart from having nowhere to live at present, the family faces all the stress of changing schools with all the associated trauma.</P>
    <P>Another example is that of a retired man aged 72 and his wife in her 60s who last week faced eviction from their home of 18 years because they would have security of tenure if they lived there a year longer. I also met another lady, aged 69, who was recently forced to move out of private accommodation she had been in for some time into a bed and breakfast. She died within a short time and no doubt the mental strain associated with the move contributed to her death. Many of these cases closely resembled the Mespil flats case some years ago. This is on a much greater scale but the problems are the same.</P>
    <P>These example show how the rented accommodation sector in Dublin is in crisis. Those in rented accommodation face an appalling scenario for which there appear to be very few practical solutions. We have very little activity in the area of co-operative or voluntary housing schemes compared to other cities and that is a real problem. It will have to change. There will have to be more activity and it will have to be Government-led. I call on the Minister to outline the immediate action the Government intends to take to relieve this situation.</P>
    <P>Threshold has stated that the number of elderly people contacting it to find out their rights regarding leases is on the rise and one of their workers has stated that more and more landlords are taking the law into their own hands, changing locks and dumping people's belongings in the street. The Simon Community has also commented on the effect of this crisis on the elderly, though young families as well as single people young and old are also being affected. A new group of homeless people is being created. It is important the findings of the new commission on the private rented sector are published as soon as possible and that we have a series of recommendations to deal with this crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal is unable to be in the House to address this matter and he asked me to do so on his behalf. I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and providing me with the opportunity to outline the Government's activities in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to addressing the country's housing needs deficit. Our priority is to facilitate the provision of appropriate housing, whether that be owner occupied, <Col N="777" /> private rented or local authority, to meet growing needs and demand. Our commitment is reflected by the inclusion, for the very first time, of housing in the national development plan. Measures are being taken to increase housing supply and restore stability in all housing sectors, including the private rented sector. Over the last decade, successive Governments have taken actions to assist in the development of a thriving, diverse and well managed private rented residential sector, in a fashion that balances the rights of both landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>The rights of tenants in private rented accommodation and the protection available to them are determined by the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancies are held and the landlord and tenant code which governs the relationship between landlord and tenant. That code is, of course, the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Notwithstanding that, my Department has taken a number of steps to provide a legal framework for the sector. These include a minimum period of notice to quit of four weeks, a removal of the right of seizure of a tenant's goods for non-payment of rent, regulations requiring landlords to provide rent books and ensure their dwellings comply with certain minimum physical standards were introduced and a requirement for landlords to register their accommodation with the local authority was put in place.</P>
    <P>The most recent information indicates that in 1999 some 25,900 properties nationally were registered by 15,198 landlords. In Dublin alone 4,610 landlords registered their properties, which represents an increase of 16.5% in the number of landlords registered in Dublin during 1998. While these figures indicate that the local authorities, which are responsible for the enforcement of the regulations, are making some progress, they still have much to do before I will be happy that the regulations are being implemented satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a number of new initiatives will further improve the situation. For example, in 1999, over £100 million was paid in rent support, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in respect of some 41,000 tenants in the private rented sector. Provision has now been made in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to allow for the provision of information to local authorities in respect of these tenancies. As a result, local authorities will be in a position to identify landlords benefiting from rent support payments who have failed to register. Such landlords may then be inspected with regard to compliance with the various housing regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition, in January new regulations were introduced to remove the exemption from the requirement to register which had applied to lettings of temporary convenience. These new regu<Col N="778" /> lations will eliminate the legal difficulties arising from the High Court judgment concerning an action taken by a local authority against a number of landlords who had failed to register their properties and which make enforcement more difficult for authorities.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to develop a thriving, diverse and well managed private rented sector. With that in mind, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal established the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector last July to examine and make recommendations on a wide range of issues relating to the sector, including improved security of tenure, maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the respective rights and obligations of landlords and tenants, and increasing investment in and the supply of accommodation in the sector.</P>
    <P>The commission had been requested to report to the Minister by 1 June 2000. However, its chairman recently requested that an additional month be provided and the Minister has acceded to this request. While not wishing to pre-empt what the report might contain, I anticipate that the recommendations will relate to changes required to the legislative and regulatory frameworks with a view to achieving better enforcement of an agreed framework and to removing certain legal difficulties that currently exist, and improved dispute resolution mechanisms. The latter includes measures to improve security of tenure, provide greater awareness of mutual rights and obligations and to amend notice to quit periods to reflect length of tenancies, as well as measures to promote the development of the sector and, in particular, to facilitate increased supply of accommodation with a view to meeting longer term housing needs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. Last week my colleague, Deputy Upton, spoke movingly of the deaths of young Rosie Lakes and other heroin addicts. Now, a few days later, we appear to have a major health problem on our hands. It is sad to consider that the recent spate of deaths might only be the tip of the iceberg. In my constituency I have noticed a steady but silent holocaust of young people dying at home and on the street as a result of heroin addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incomprehensible that the Taoiseach, who represents probably the most deprived constituency in Ireland and is familiar with this problem, has not already ordered a strong emergency response from the health and justice Departments. The news in recent days of the sudden deaths of 14 drug users has highlighted the ongoing problem of people with severe heroin addiction. The current spate of deaths is comparable to a major fire or transport disaster and there <Col N="779" /> is an onus on the Government to begin an emergency programme.</P>
    <P>As the similarity with the addiction deaths in Glasgow is so striking, we must pay close attention to Scottish medical personnel. Dr. Laurence Gruer, a consultant with the Greater Glasgow Health Board, has indicated that addicts who injected directly into the muscle may have been contaminated with a mysterious new bacteria which then invaded their organs and destroyed their systems. One of Dr. Gruer's colleagues told Vincent Browne a week ago that a batch of very pure heroin had been responsible for many of the Glasgow deaths. One of its effects is to close down functions such as breathing and this was responsible for the deaths in the Glasgow area.</P>
    <P>There is now an emergency in Dublin and the Government must take responsibility for dealing with it. The health authorities and the Garda should be given guidelines to expedite measures to treat addicts, control the use of heroin and find the source of the contaminated drugs. Only those presenting themselves for treatment are getting updated information on the risks of injecting heroin. The majority of addicts are not receiving treatment and they need up to date reports on the issue. The only way of targeting many of them is through personal contact. Additional staff must be deployed to work with voluntary organisations in making contact with addicts who are not presenting themselves for treatment and are not involved with their local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>In addition, addicts should be given increased access to methadone dispensing services. The message must be conveyed throughout the city that heroin should not be injected. According to the information available to date, addicts are only attending hospital at the last minute if they develop acute symptoms after taking heroin. They have a higher chance of survival if they are identified early. All Dublin hospitals, therefore, should have emergency plans and deal with addicts as a priority.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government on some of the initiatives it has taken in relation to the local drugs task forces, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan. Areas such as Kilbarrack, Darndale, Belcamp and Kilmore in my constituency led the way in the provision of local treatment and rehabilitation centres. However, more must be done. Many parishes in the city do not have a treatment facility and there are long waiting lists for those which have. In the last five weeks, up to half a dozen parents and friends of addicts called to my clinics to tell me they were fearful their son, daughter or friend would die from heroin addiction if they did not receive assistance and treatment.</P>
    <P>When the drugs task forces were launched by the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, they were considered an effective means of coming to <Col N="780" /> grips with this tremendous catastrophe which affects at least 13,000 people in the city. Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> claims that the current drugs crisis has little to do with class issues but is the result of the authorities not devising a coherent or workable anti-drugs policy. However, it is a class issue. Many of the worst affected areas do not have enough health resources or resources for the drugs task forces or Garda Síochána. In the Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East constituencies, for example, there are approximately 180 gardaí to police 250,000 people.</P>
    <P>We need a proactive emergency programme to deal not only with the current crisis but also with the overall problem of heroin addiction which is devastating the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Broughan's concern about the recent deaths from heroin and I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of all those concerned. I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; that it is continuing to monitor this situation carefully.</P>
      <P>On 9 May, the Greater Glasgow Health Board reported that there was a growing number of cases of unusual severe illness among heroin drug injectors in Glasgow. On 19 May a description of the Glasgow cases was issued on the European infection warning system requesting health authorities throughout Europe to actively seek similar cases in their own areas. The illnesses appeared to be related to injecting heroin into tissues rather than veins which caused severe damage and extensive necrosis. In severe cases there was a rapid deterioration over a number of days which developed into a septic shock syndrome. The alert was then issued by the national disease surveillance centre to directors of public health. When the ERHA department of public health received this warning, it immediately contacted the hospitals in its region to pass on the alert and to ascertain if there were similar cases here.</P>
      <P>The ERHA department of public health's inquiries found that since 1 May, 14 heroin users have been hospitalised from the Eastern Regional Health Authority region suffering from severe unidentified illness. They all met the case definition which is an injecting drug user with evidence of a severe inflammatory process. Seven of these patients have died. Three of the remaining patients have been discharged from hospital and four are still receiving treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ERHA is working closely with the authorities in Glasgow, the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta to try to isolate and identify the exact cause of the illness. The ERHA department of public health has received notifications from the city and county coroner of 19 deaths of heroin users since April. The Garda are investigating 14 of these cases and, of these, seven fit the case <Col N="781" /> definition above, four do not and three are being further investigated.</P>
    <P>The ERHA department of public health is also at present investigating the cause of the death of another heroin user who died in a Dublin hospital on Wednesday, 31 May 2000. It has not yet been established if this case will fit the case definition.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has been introducing measures to inform drug misusers of the present dangers and to encourage people into treatment. It has advised any heroin users who develop a significant swelling or abscess, particularly near an injection site, to seek medical help from their doctor or hospital as soon as possible. It has also advised any heroin users who develop unusual symptoms of illnesses to seek medical help immediately. The three area health boards have posted notices in their health centres, drug treatment centres and other facilities warning people that there may be contaminated heroin on the streets. They have also notified general practitioners in the areas.</P>
    <P>Outreach workers have been focused in areas where drug users may not have heard of the current risks. The area health boards have appealed widely through the media to heroin users to stop using the drug and to contact a clinic for assessment for treatment. Services have been expanded to meet an increased demand where the risk of contaminated heroin may encourage drug users to come off the drug. Patients on low dose methadone will be given the opportunity for increased enrichment of the dose to discourage the practice of topping up with heroin.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are also being made to increase treatment capacity in a number of specific areas, James's Street, Crumlin, Cabra and Finglas, Darndale and Inchicore. The boards are working to the best of their ability to significantly increase the number of additional treatment places being made available. Two mobile buses will continue to provide emergency services at Dr. Steeven's Hospital, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Empress Place and other suitable locations. I understand that, arising from these initiatives, 70 new patients had presented themselves up to Tuesday of this week.</P>
    <P>The boards have also established a freefone helpline which is operating seven days a week and which people can call if they are worried about drug using practices. This helpline will also offer advice to heroin misusers and information and referral to treatment centres.</P>
    <P>The EHRA is taking all appropriate action in this matter and I am assured of its continued efforts in this regard. I again express my concern at the number of deaths caused by this episode and my sympathy to the families of those involved. I wish to condemn all those involved in supplying heroin to users who are the unfortunate victims of their deadly trade. I wish to place on the record that the Taoiseach has taken a deep <Col N="782" /> personal interest in this issue and has initiated co-ordination between my Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, the National Drugs Advisory Board and the Faculty of Public Health Medicine and so on, all of whom are actively involved in trying to isolate the cause of this problem and deal and expand advice and treatment facilities. Resources are not an issue in terms of opening more treatment facilities in Dublin. There are other factors, particularly the NIMBY factor, which has retarded the expansion of treatment centres in some areas in the city. However, the authorities will not rest until the cause of this problem is isolated and action is taken to help those suffering from the effects of this contaminated heroin.</P>

      <P>At a recent Limerick County Council meeting there was unanimous support that the Department of the Environment and Local Government should undertake re-roofing and refurbishment work on 43 houses at Clenma Estate in Croom, County Limerick. In the early 1970s, the National Building Agency, based on a Government initiative to facilitate industrial development at different locations, embarked on a building programme. It located houses at Newport, County Tipperary, which were subsequently purchased by the local county council, 140 houses at Glasgow Park in Limerick and 43 houses at Clenma, Croom, County Limerick. Of the 43 houses in the estate, 36 are owned and seven are rented from the council. The houses have substandard roofs. Insurance companies are unwilling to insure the houses because of the substandard roofs and the high risk factor involved. At present the residents have to cope with dampness and leakage of the roofs and walls. This is the only estate of its type in the country that has not been upgraded.</P>
      <P>Limerick Corporation, because of political pressure, was provided with funds to upgrade 140 houses at Glasgow Park in Limerick. This decision was made in recent years. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will, if it is consistent with its approach in the past, state that it is primarily a private housing estate, thus, the residents are responsible for the works they may wish to carry out on their dwellings. It is my contention that the people in this estate, based on a previous Government decision, are being unfairly discriminated against. It is not sufficient for the Minister of State's Department, like Pontius Pilate, to wash its hands of the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This original housing scheme was a Government initiative. I also believe the Minister of State should meet a delegation from this estate to look at the houses involved in order to get a better appreciation of what is required. The need to <Col N="783" /> provide funds for the improvements on these houses rests with the Minister of State's Department. As I pointed out at the outset, all politicians in County Limerick support the residents of Clenma, Croom, in their just demands. I sincerely hope and call on the Minister of State to give a favourable respond to their demands. </P>

      <P>As with the previous matter, I have been asked by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, to speak on his behalf. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to set out the position. At the outset and before dealing with the issues raised here, I must make it clear that there are no proposals from Limerick County Council before the Department for consideration in relation to this housing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the issue is as follows. The 43 houses were constructed in 1974 by the National Building Agency under the guaranteed order programme initiated by the Government of the day. Under this programme, special funding was provided for the construction of houses to accommodate industrial workers. Loans were advanced by the National Building Agency to 31 applicants nominated by SFADCo to purchase houses. The balance of the houses were purchased by Limerick County Council at that time. In the intervening years a number of the council dwellings were purchased under tenant purchase schemes until at present when only six of the 43 houses are in council ownership. The position is, therefore, that this is primarily a private housing <Col N="784" /> estate in which the majority of houses were not provided by the local authority. Consequently, apart from the small number of houses in the ownership of Limerick County Council, the private householders are responsible for any works they may wish to undertake to their dwellings.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options currently available to assist lower income householders and elderly persons, in particular, to secure the necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes, improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly. I understand that Limerick Corporation had repairs carried out to similar type houses which were funded under the improvement works in lieu of rehousing scheme and which involved the re-roofing and exterior treatment of the houses.</P>
    <P>It would be open to Limerick County Council to consider whether any of the above-mentioned schemes could be used to assist the homeowners in this case. Should a valid application for assistance under the terms of the scheme operated by the Department be received from the council, I can assure the Deputy that it will receive prompt consideration.</P>
    <P>In so far as the local authority owned dwellings are concerned, their management, maintenance and improvement is a matter for Limerick County Council, to be funded from its own resources.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 June 2000.</P>

      <QRef>[15451/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): One of the objectives set by the Government under the national development plan is that the plan should support the achievement of equal opportunities between men and women. The goal of gender equality covers the whole plan including infrastructure and productive investment as well as the regional, human resources and peace programmes. The plan provides that project selection criteria must have regard to the equal opportunities objective and all statistical outcomes under the plan will be sex differentiated. Gender balance on monitoring committees is also an objective.</P>
    <P>A special unit has been established within my Department to support all implementing Departments and delivery agencies to meet the equal opportunity objective in their programmes, measures and initiatives. This unit, the equal opportunities promotion and monitoring unit, will provide an advisory, training, and information service on issues relating to gender and the national development plan. It will also provide assistance to Departments in carrying out gender impact assessment of policy proposals drawn up in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>With the aid of EU technical assistance, my Department has recruited a gender equality expert with effect from 1 December 1999; contracted for gender disaggregated statistics across the plan; and organised a series of training programmes in Dublin, Waterford and Roscommon for officials who will be involved in implementing this process.</P>
    <P>The gender disaggregated statistics will guide the development of gender indicators at measure level across the plan to support the monitoring and evaluation of gender equality outcomes over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved gender impact assessment guidelines to assist Government Departments and implementing bodies in assessing the gender impact of their proposals. The guidelines were developed from a model proposed in the Partnership 2000 report on gender proofing on which the social partners and a research team from NUI, Cork, had advised.</P>
    <P>The guidelines contain three basic steps to assist in assessing gender impact of policies, namely, (1) outlining the current position of men <Col N="786" /> and women in the expenditure area concerned; (2) identifying the factors which lead to women and men being affected differently; (3) where considered appropriate, proposing measures to address a differential impact.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are available on my Department's website.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the national voluntary age card scheme, which came into operation in April of last year following the making of regulations by me, as Minister, under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. This is a voluntary scheme for persons who have already attained 18 years of age and who are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. In this way, the voluntary scheme is designed to assist both consumers and licensees. As the details already contained on the age card provide sufficient evidence of age, the inclusion of a person's RSI number would be of no additional benefit.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, it is not my intention to amend the age cards issued under the national voluntary age card scheme to include a person's RSI number.</P>

      <P>The overall annual average cost of keeping an offender in custody is estimated at £54,431 for 1999. This figure represents an increase of just under 2% over the figure for 1998. A breakdown between institutions is not yet available.</P>
      <P>This figure is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders over a certain period, in this case the year 1999. The equivalent figure for the year to date in 2000 is not yet available.</P>
      <P>These running costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the level of prisoners in custody, i.e. mainly officers' wages but also such items as lighting and heating.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, provides that certain bodily samples may be taken without the consent of a person in custody for the purpose of forensic testing. These samples include hair, other than pubic hair, a nail and any material found under a nail.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on criminal law, appointed to consider changes in the criminal law which were recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, recommended a number of changes to the law relating to forensic samples. In particular, it recommended that, as an aid to DNA testing, saliva be re-classified as a sample which can be taken without consent. These recommendations are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for inclusion in a Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the potential benefits of a comprehensive DNA database. The 1990 Act already allows for the maintenance of certain DNA records. Two particular issues arise in relation to the establishment of a comprehensive DNA data bank. The first relates to the legal powers to take forensic samples compulsorily and, as I have indicated, this matter is being addressed. The second relates to the criteria under which samples would be held. This raises difficult issues involving the rights of the individual and of society to take reasonable measures to protect itself.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the deportation of persons who have had their application for asylum refused and persons whose application for asylum is transferred to another country under the Dublin Convention. Persons who have been granted refugee status are entitled to remain in the State.</P>
      <P>The power of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a deportation order is set out in section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. To date, I have signed a total of 396 deportation orders under that legislation.</P>
      <P>In deciding whether to make a deportation or not in respect of the persons in question, each case is considered on its own particular merits in accordance with the criteria specified in section 3(6) of that Act. Those criteria include, for example, humanitarian considerations which would obviously take into account the conditions prevailing in a particular country at a given point in time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have brought forward a series of measures to strengthen and make more effective the deportation process. These include the recent establishment of a Garda National Immigration Bureau and legislative changes to the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Bill which I introduced in this House yesterday to strengthen deportation procedures. In addition, increased resources are being allocated to accelerate the asylum process. These measures will increase significantly the numbers of orders made and effected without compromising in any way the detailed consideration necessary under statute in each particular case. The effective deportation of those whose asylum applications have been unsuccessful and in respect of whom deportation orders have been made is essential if we are to maintain the integrity of the asylum process and the package of measures which I have put in place are intended to achieve this.</P>

    <P>Failure to present oneself at a particular place and time for the purpose of giving effect to a deportation order renders a person, as it must, liable to arrest and detention under the provisions of section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999.

    <P>A total of 30 persons have been deported to date under the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999. Of those, four were under the age of 18 years and part of a family unit who had consented to be deported. Section 5(4) of the Act provides that an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána cannot arrest or detain a person under 18 years of age who has not complied with a provision of a deportation order or a requirement of the official notification conveying the Minister's decision to deport. It also provides that where the parent of a child is detained, the immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána shall without delay notify the relevant health board of the detention and the circumstances thereof. I would like to reassure the Deputy that I and officials in my Department would be particularly sensitive to all aspects of any case involving a minor.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that my Department will, in 2001, conduct a review of the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, in consultation with the social partners. This commitment is in accordance with section 28 of the Act, which provides for a review of the operation of the Act within not less than two years and not more than three years of its commencement on 3 December 1998. This review, which will be carried out during 2001, will provide an opportunity to assess provisions of the Act in the light of its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion on 3 April 2000, to the effect that Ireland, by restricting the right to parental leave to employees with children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996, had not fully complied with its obligations under clause 2(1) of the framework agreement on parental leave annexed to Directive 96/34/EC (parental leave directive). My Department has examined the reasoned opinion, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, with a view to identifying the measures to be put in place to give effect to it. My Department has met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, in relation to implementation of the reasoned opinion. Following these consultations, proposals for amending the Parental Leave Act, <Col N="791" /> 1998, to comply with the Reasoned Opinion, are being drawn up in consultation with the office of the Attorney General. The European Commission have been informed of our proposals and its response is awaited. To ensure that the reasoned opinion is responded to as expeditiously as possible, it is my intention to amend the Parental Leave Act, 1998, by way of regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Numbers 79 and 87 of 2 February 2000 and 296 of 15 February 2000, the Garda Commissioner, in 1999, commenced a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements. He established an internal working group to recommend improved clearance arrangements which would allow the Garda Síochána to respond effectively to the increasing number of requests to expand the system. Arising from the recommendations of the working group, the Garda Commissioner approved the establishment of a new centralised unit to deal with clearance requests. The commissioner also asked an implementation group to report on the practical and resource implications of the new unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the use of violence and intimidation by criminals is not a new phenomenon and in cases where the victims are also involved in crime there can be major difficulties involved in investigating the crime.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of a rigorous Garda investigation. The identification of the motive, such as an association with organised crime and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution processes. Speculation as to the nature of the motive could serve to jeopardise successful investigations and prosecution of serious crimes such as those resulting in unlawful killing.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to recent violent incidents and he has informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards these areas of criminal activity and that a continued proactive and integrated approach is taken by the gardaí to the investigation of cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of organised criminals. He has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and bring those involved to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> My policy of tough legislation, backed up by strong law enforcement measures, has proven to be an extremely effective approach to combating organised crime. I have adopted strong legislation, such as the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. The Act has also brought in a range of other measures designed to prevent intimidation of witnesses, jurors, those assisting the gardaí in the investigation of an offence and their families and provides a maximum ten year prison sentence upon conviction of these offences.</P>
    <P>Special measures such as the witness security programme have been developed in order to prevent criminals from intimidating those who assist the authorities in bringing these criminals to book.</P>
    <P>Another important piece of legislation, which I introduced while in opposition, is the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. This has been utilised very effectively by the Criminal Assets Bureau to successfully confiscate the moneys earned through criminal activities.</P>
    <P>The success of our strong law enforcement policies in combating the problems of organised crime and drugs at national and local levels has been well documented and combined with our tough legislation have resulted in major organised crime gangs being dismantled and a number of criminals fleeing this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Our legislation is among the toughest in Europe for tackling organised crime, but I am always evaluating, in conjunction with the Garda, the best way to deal with all crime, and I will take whatever steps are necessary to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is concerned only with the numbers of asylum seekers living in the specific Dublin postal areas mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has been responsible since 10 April last for accommodating asylum seekers. Under the current arrangements asylum seekers are accommodated at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one to two weeks for the purposes of needs assessment, the provision of information and the processing of the initial stages of their asylum applications before being resettled at other locations around the country. An initial reception centre at Francis Street, Dublin 8, has a capacity of 110. The directorate also uses an accommodation centre at Harrington Street, Dublin 8, which has a capacity of 25.</P>
      <P>Prior to 10 April, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers was handled, in the main, by the Eastern Health Board, in whose administrative area the majority of asylum seekers are located. Asylum seekers who have been accommodated by the Eastern Health Board are free to re-locate to other accommodation, if they so wish. While their applications for refugee status are being processed asylum seekers are obliged to make their addresses known to my Department and must also inform the Department of any change of address. Records at the Refugee Applications Centre, which is responsible for the processing of asylum applications, indicate that there are currently 1,799 asylum seekers living in Dublin 8, 18 in Dublin 10 and 113 in Dublin 12. However, it is difficult to be absolutely certain about the accuracy of these figures as not all asylum applicants notify changes of address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers are entitled to a range of services while waiting to have their applications pro<Col N="795" /> cessed. For example, subject to satisfying means tests, asylum seekers are entitled to allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and medical cards. They are entitled to the same health services as Irish medical card holders. The children of asylum seekers can avail of free primary and secondary education. These services are provided by a number of different Government Departments or agencies and the expenditure involved is a matter for the Departments and agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I have spoken in the House on many occasions on this subject. As I have informed the House before, the detailed deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The present arrangements for the investigation of missing persons cases are that local Garda management take direct responsibility for the cases and that special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate all missing persons. On an international level, the Garda liaise with Interpol and non-Governmental organisations where there is a world-wide network to trace missing persons. The House may be interested to know that Europol can now assist in missing person's investigations and that a representative has been nominated from each member State in the European Union for assistance and liaison in cases of suspected trafficking in human beings.</P>
      <P>In general, files on missing persons remain open until there is a conclusion to the case and each case is kept under continuous review. Many searches have taken place and further searches will be based on available information and intelligence. I am also assured that contact is maintained on a regular basis with the families of missing persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that each of the cases currently under review by Operation TRACE was investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappear<Col N="797" /> ance and all information and leads relating to these cases is systematically analysed and followed up. As the House is aware Operation TRACE has yielded new lines of inquiries which have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. A unique database has been devised which facilitates cross referencing of detail and highlighting of similarities among the vast amount of information which has been collated. I understand that the Garda also has an Internet website for missing persons cases and that the PULSE computer system has been specifically adapted to assist in these investigations. Furthermore, I understand that a national computer dental database is currently being developed in co-operation between the Garda and the National Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of cases in respect of which the files are still open, I am informed by the Garda authorities that all missing persons files remain open until the person is located, or in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated earlier, missing persons files remain open until there is a conclusion to the case. In relation to the number of files which are still open, I understand that, taking the past five years, 1995 to 1999, there are approximately 60 files still open which relate to this period. I can assure the House that all necessary resources are being made available to the Garda to enable it to carry out these investigations. As the House will appreciate, in investigations such as this progress is slow and the investigations are time consuming.</P>

      <P>As the House will appreciate, since the term &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; is not, in legal terms, a specific sexual offence, it is not recorded as such. It is not, therefore, currently possible to provide official Garda statistics for date rape, as this would entail making inquiries in each case, and even then it would not necessarily be possible to provide statistics with any degree of confidence that they were completely accurate. In addition, the term date rape is subject to a high degree of subjectivity and variability.</P>

      <Col N="798" /> From research published in 1998 by An Garda Síochána into rapes recorded during the 1994 to 1997 period, offenders were known, to some extent, to the victims in 87% of cases. The Garda research estimates that 11% of rapes occurred in circumstances where the victim began the day in the company of the offender or where they joined company during the course of the day.</P>
    <P>Between 1996 and 1997, the incidence of rape reported to the Garda Síochána increased by 42%. The rate of increase slowed to 14% in 1998, the last year for which statistics have been published. I understand that provisional statistics for 1999 indicate a fall of 2% in the number of rapes reported to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>The general trend in reported rapes in recent years seems to be due to a number of factors as I have previously outlined to the House. Among these factors are the higher incidence of rape in the present day, cases of rape from previous years being reported in the present day and, perhaps, an increased willingness on the part of victims to report rape which may be due to the availability of better services for victims in the present day.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda Síochána actively pursues and investigates all reported crimes of a sexual nature, including rape. The domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit which was established in 1993 was given a national remit in 1997 in the area of sexual crimes. I have been advised that An Garda Síochána continues to enhance their knowledge and expertise in the investigation of such offences by ongoing training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House on 13 April 2000 in reply to Questions Nos. 9 and 38, I am very aware of the damage done to local communities by the scourge of joyriding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the provisions of the Road Traffics Acts, 1961-1993, as enforced by them are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner. I should state, however, that any amendment to road traffic legislation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Govern<Col N="801" /> ment who is responsible for all road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>I am determined to see that the Garda has all the resources it needs to tackle crime effectively. There are now 600 more gardaí in the force than when I came into office. The Garda fleet has also increased substantially.</P>
    <P>A number of measures specifically targeted at reducing the incidence of joyriding are also in place. I am informed by the Garda authorities that special foot and mobile patrols, targeting specific areas are in place in response to identified local requirements. All vehicles subject of unauthorised takings are technically examined when recovered and known offenders are targeted for these offences.</P>
    <P>Each division also has a traffic unit who outside of peak traffic hours target incidents of joyriding and enforcement of section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, provides the Garda with the powers to stop and seize vehicles they believe to be driven by underage drivers, who by reason of their age are ineligible to hold a driving licence and insurance. I am informed by the Garda authorities that special plain clothes patrols which concentrate on identifying cars that could be seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, are showing some success. I am also informed that the Stinger vehicle stopping device was used on 29 occasions during the years 1997 and 1998. However, the use of these devices is restricted and overall public safety is the prime consideration in each specific incident.</P>
    <P>The Garda air support unit has been particularly effective in this area and has assisted in the recovery of over 100 vehicles and the making of 194 arrests in 1998. Some of the arrests related to unauthorised taking of MPVs.</P>
    <P>In relation to Garda liaison with community groups and the attempts being made to deter joyriders, there are a number of projects in operation which deal with this aspect of youth crime and which have proved valuable in identifying offenders. In Coolock, for example, joyriders have been referred to one of the Garda youth diversion projects, funded by my Department. Similarly, in the south inner city youths who come to the attention of the Garda are referred to City Motor Sports where various motor appreciation courses are run.</P>
    <P>Some of the local responses to joyriding include Operation Steering Wheel which was developed by the Garda authorities to deal specifically with the problem of joyriding in Coolock. The operation is ongoing and comprises uniform, foot and mobile patrols targeting specific locations on a nightly basis. Gardaí are also involved in a task force to address the problem in the Coolock area. A special resource unit comprising one sergeant and eight gardaí was established to specifically target incidents of joyriding in west Tallaght. The AutoCrime Diversion Project, under the auspices of the probation and wel<Col N="802" /> fare service, plays a role in addressing the problem in Cork.</P>
    <P>In relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding, I understand that co-operation between the Garda and local authorities is ongoing with a view to effecting physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the damage, both mental and physical, that joyriding inflicts on community life. However, I have complete confidence in the range of measures being developed by the Garda Síochána to combat the problem and to discharge its role in maintaining law and order.</P>

      <P>The most recent information available to me in relation to the proposed move of the headquarters of the Legal Aid Board to Caherciveen is that the contract for the purchase of the site for the new head office building has been signed. I am informed that the Office of Public Works will shortly be issuing tender documentation to a shortlist of contractors to design and build the new premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff who have indicated that they are not willing to transfer usually do so in expectation that their wishes in that regard will remain in confi<Col N="803" /> dence between them and their respective personnel officers. For that reason I do not propose to depart from the normal practice of not disclosing the precise numbers and grades of those who do not have an interest in transferring, lest those who have expressed such a wish be identified.</P>
    <P>However, I can tell the House that a number of Legal Aid Board staff have expressed an interest in transferring to Caherciveen and a further number have signalled an interest in moving in the event of promotional opportunities becoming available.</P>
    <P>As regards recruitment the position is that the Legal Aid Board, in accordance with normal decentralisation procedures, requested the Department of Finance to issue an interdepartmental circular seeking applicants from throughout the Civil Service willing to transfer. I understand that this circular is expected to issue very shortly. Both staff and unions are being kept informed of developments.</P>
    <P>The proposed number of staff to be located to Cahirciveen is 39 but when account is taken of the staff at dual locations, the total number of staff working from the Cahirciveen base will be 42. At this stage of the process it is not possible to provide the Deputy with details of the number of staff to be recruited or to estimate the costs associated with the provision of a new headquarters premises and ancillary expenses associated with the move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Public discussion and commentary about the issue of the treatment of sex offenders frequently implies that the dedicated sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill prison is the only form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in Irish prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their personal tendencies towards offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling from my Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service. This is a largely demand led service to individual prisoners who ask for help. The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work pro<Col N="804" /> gramme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since 1998. The third intervention which tends to receive most media coverage is the extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison and which is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of my Department. All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this programme. The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and a call-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises.</P>
    <P>On 18 May last 352 convicted sex offenders were held in custody in Irish Prisons. Many of these are participating in one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above. Ten prisoners are undertaking the dedicated treatment programme, referred to above, in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    <P>I have asked the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. A working group chaired by the director general and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The first step being taken involves the expansion of generic therapeutic services in the Curragh. The probation and welfare service and the psychology service of the Department are recruiting extra staff at present and it is intended that the Curragh will have priority in the allocation of resources. A member of the psychology service and a probation officer have already been assigned to duties in the Curragh. They will be joined in their work with offenders at the Curragh by further members of their services as the roll out of support services for sex offenders at the prison continues.</P>
    <P>The sequence which will be followed at the Curragh include analysis of response by individual prisoners and staff to circular from governor as to their willingness to participate in the new programme; training of local staff in all disciplines and services in thinking skills programme is ongoing; delivery of first modules of thinking skills programme late summer 2000; and roll-out of intensive sex offenders treatment programme later in the year 2000 drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork prison early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to <Col N="805" /> engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service. The skills taught in this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. This programme is considered by the director general and his advisers to be the preferred first line of approach to rehabilitating sex offenders in custody as in many cases it builds up their frequently low personal motivation to address offending behaviour in depth.</P>
    <P>When the intensive sex offenders treatment programme is introduced in the Curragh during the current year it will be operated by the probation and welfare service and Psychology Service in the same mode as the current Arbour Hill programme.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the director general that he has deputed a senior member of his transition team at prison governor level and another colleague to investigate the possibility of extending the range of multidisciplinary group work programmes with sex offenders here based on successful interventions which have been developed in prisons in Scotland and England in recent years. This particular study is not expected to be completed until early next year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the interventions described above are beneficial and appropriate. The ultimate objective for the Irish Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions, including Ireland, that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or indeed legal option in such cases.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to make it known that a major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of this Department and the Department of Psychology, University College, Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for the apprehension and arrest of persons suspected of smuggling or the illegal importation of controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>The Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled into the State by sea and air.</P>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for Defence has informed me, that while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service, Naval Service vessels may be deployed during the course of routine patrols to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
      <P>The joint task force, involving the Garda, the Customs and Excise Service and the Naval Service, established in 1993 is utilised to co-ordinate an appropriate strategy for the seizure of drugs and the apprehension of the criminals involved in smuggling drugs into Ireland. This task force comes together where there is sufficient intelligence available to warrant an operation. All three agencies are involved if the operation has a maritime dimension and where the operation is other than maritime in nature and does not require the expertise of the Naval Service only the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise Service are involved.</P>
      <P>Fourteen joint operations involving the customs and excise service and the Garda have been undertaken in the past two years. As a result of these operations drugs with an estimated street value in excess of £19 million were seized.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply of 18 April 2000, a total of 27 unprovoked attacks on young males, aged 25 or younger, were recorded by the Garda Síochána in the Dublin metropolitan region for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 March 2000. I have already publicly indicated my concern, particularly in relation to the savagery of these types of attack and I can assure the House that no effort will be spared in bringing the perpetrators to justice. I understand from the Garda authorities that they have responded to such attacks with increased high visibility patrolling in areas with identified problems, and areas where large numbers of young people congregate. In addition, I understand that all members of the Garda Síochána have been instructed to utilise their powers under public order legislation to full effect when dealing with such incidents. I should mention also that crime prevention advice in relation to this matter is also given to young males through the schools programme, where appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The bishops' committee on asylum seekers and refugees issued a statement on 26 April 2000 which, <i>inter alia</i>, called for the granting of refugee status on a block basis to all persons who applied for asylum by a given date and whose applications have not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in applications for asylum in Ireland in recent years. Compared to some 4,626 applications for 1998 there were 7,724 applications in 1999. So far this year some 4,582 applications have been received up to 29 May 2000. For the first quarter of 2000, some international statistics place Ireland second within the EU for asylum applications received as a proportion of total population.</P>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the concerns expressed by the bishops in their statement, I would point out that what is, in effect, being called for is an amnesty for the asylum seekers concerned. For a number of reasons, I would not support this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a possible amnesty here was considered in 1998 by the interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues. Having taken into account all necessary factors, the committee recommended that an amnesty should not be introduced as to do so could have <Col N="808" /> an adverse impact on the integrity of the asylum processing system.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of dealing fairly and humanely with asylum seekers here is to establish a coherent framework within which they will have their applications processed speedily and in accordance with the best international practice, and to integrate those persons granted refugee status fully into Irish society. My Department has made significant progress in this regard and it is considered that the introduction of an amnesty would undermine this progress and, indeed, send out the wrong signals especially to those who are engaged in the trafficking of persons.</P>
    <P>The number of asylum applicants in the State who meet refugee criteria, as laid down by the Geneva Convention 1951, is quite small. Approximately 25% of applications are found to be entitled to refugee status having completed the application process, including those cases adjudicated upon by the independent appeals authorities. Thus an amnesty, if introduced, would mainly benefit a large number of applicants who would not normally be entitled to refugee status.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am satisfied that Ireland fulfils its international obligations to those seeking asylum. These obligations are a reflection of our humanitarian concern that persons suffering persecution, and in need of protection when they reach our shores, will receive that protection.  </P>

    <P>A new £6 million information technology programme, authorised by me, for the Prison Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database will be deployed across the Prison Service later this year. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently obtained Government approval for the construction of a further 700 closed prison spaces with support facilities. This Government has made funding available on an unprecedented scale to redress the inadequacy of investment in the past in this area. I am honouring the Government's pledge to build new prison places and refurbish our existing prisons, many of which are 150 years old. The extra places are required due to a multiplicity of factors including the following issues.</P>
      <P>Sex Offences &ndash; The continued growth in reporting rates both for recent sex offences and child abuse offences from the past has resulted in an unprecedented number of court cases. In turn, increasingly lengthy prison sentences for offenders in this category are being imposed by the courts.</P>
      <P>Temporary Release &ndash; A requirement to continue to reduce numbers on unstructured temporary release arising from shedding prisoners to make way for new committals from the courts.</P>
      <P>The Bail Act, 1997 &ndash; expected increase in numbers in custody on a daily basis. There is a consensus from practitioners in the criminal justice area that this will significantly increase the prisoner population in the short to medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overcrowding &ndash; to reduce gross overcrowding in Mountjoy and Cork Prisons. I am <Col N="810" /> totally committed to refurbishing Mountjoy Prison which will result in a permanent reduction in capacity there as the prison reverts to single cell accommodation.</P>
    <P>Serious Crime &ndash; It is anticipated that as a result of concerted action by the authorities in relation to serious crime, additional spaces will be required.</P>
    <P>Specialised Accommodation Needs &ndash; Under the provisions of the Children Bill, 1999, separate, dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of up to 140 male juvenile and 20 female juvenile offenders.</P>
    <P>Women Offenders &ndash; In line with trends across Europe, the number of women sentenced to prison continues to rise in this jurisdiction, thus additional accommodation is required. Also  women prisoners in the Munster area are held in extremely poor conditions at Limerick Prison which have been widely condemned for many years. This situation must be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issues raised by commentators cited by the Deputy, I would like to point out that I fully support alternatives to custody and that I have personally introduced and provided increased funding for many alternative projects which are now available to the courts. Advocates in favour of terminating our prison building programme cannot have it both ways. They cannot condemn degrading prison conditions and simultaneously deplore the practical and necessary building measures which address the problem. For example, it would not be possible for me, as I have already announced, to refurbish Mountjoy Prison &ndash; wing by wing &ndash; had I not embarked on my prison building programme. We are not in an either/or situation in terms of investing in both prison spaces and alternatives to custody.</P>
    <P>The estimated construction cost is £115 million.</P>

      <P>Particular emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of young offenders while in custody and, accordingly, a wide range of services are made available such as an education service, vocational training, library service, sports-physical education, psychology service, probation and welfare service, medical services, addiction counselling and chaplaincy service. Every effort is made locally by the governor of each institution to co-ordinate the work of the various services.</P>
      <P>Offenders under the age of 21 years who respond to planned programmes including pre-release, may be granted temporary release &ndash; Criminal Justice Act 1960 &ndash; under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. During pre-release planning, vocational training and employment opportunities are discussed and where possible a placement is made. Where an offender is in need of accommodation, arrangements are made by the probation and welfare service to facilitate the offender in Priorswood House, Coolock, Dublin 5 or Sarsfield House, Ballyfermot, Dublin 10.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service in association with community groups has developed nine day training facilities in a number of areas. Offenders under the age of 21 years on release from custody are offered a place in one of the facilities, provided that they have been assessed as suitable. The day training centres are located in the following areas: Deonach-Target, Tallaght, Dublin 24; Dochas don Oige Workshop, Galway; Moyross Probation Project, Limerick; North Clondalkin Probation Project, Clondalkin, Dublin 24; PACE Training Centre, Santry, Dublin 9; Tivoli Training Centre, Dun Laoghaire; Training Workshop, Ballinasloe, County Galway; Training Workshop, Tuam, County Galway and Treble R Industries, Chancery Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>A further two workshops will become operational in Athlone and Portlaoise later in the year.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service has also made efforts to improve training and employment opportunities for offenders under the age of 21 years by engaging a small number of employment-support workers under an EU pilot project. This programme commenced in January of this year and the outcomes to date are encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offenders released from custody under the age of 21 years who have completed their sentence are offered voluntary aftercare but experience shows that less than 10% avail of this opportunity.

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a system of law that would require an unmarried father to register his name on the birth certificate of his child and that such registration would give automatic rights of guardianship to the father.</P>
      <P>Under the law as it stands, the entry of an unmarried father's name on his child's birth certificate is prima facie evidence that he is the father of that child. While birth registration constitutes an important method of establishing parentage it has no effect, under our law, on the guardianship rights of the father. I should add, however, that a father's duty to maintain his child and his right to apply to the court for custody of or access to his child is not contingent on his being made a guardian.</P>
      <P>I have indicated to the House on several occasions in response to questions that policy in our law on guardianship as contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Status of Children Act, 1997, has been the subject of review in the course of preparation of the Bill which led to the Children Act, 1997, and that in the course of preparation of that Bill I strengthened it in the area of guardianship, custody and access with a provision that the court, in settling disputes in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. That provision was inspired by the provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child now referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that in settling disputes between parents the court must decide cases on the basis of the welfare of the child being paramount. That is a feature of the law in many other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>There are no further proposals to amend the law in this area, although its operation is being kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 12 May 2000 I signed a re-admission agreement on behalf of the Government with the Government of Romania in Bucharest. The main purpose of the agreement is to provide for the re-admission to either contracting party of citizens of the other contracting party who are residing in either State without authorisation; the re-admission of third country citizens, persons who do not have citizenship of either of the contracting parties including stateless persons, who arrived in either State from the other State and who are residing without authorisation; and the possibility, in limited circumstances, of third country citizens transiting either State, under escort, while being returned to a third country.</P>
      <P>Copies of the agreement have been laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>During the course of discussions, it was agreed that two Romanian officials, one from the Romanian police and one from the Immigration Service, would be seconded to Dublin to work with our immigration authorities. In this regard, I would point out that exchanges of this nature for the purpose of strengthening international co-operation are not new. For example, as I announced on 8 May 2000, the Government, as part of a number of measures agreed in relation to asylum, refugees and immigration matters, approved the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements by the placing of Garda liaison officers in London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities particularly on immigration matters with particular reference to the combating of trafficking activity. As the vast majority of asylum seekers arrive in the State via the United Kingdom or France, the Government recognises that a strengthening of international liaison with those countries, in particular, will be important in identifying immigration trends and flows and other immigration related activities. The Garda Síochána already have permanent liaision officers in Madrid, The Hague and in the Europol headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of the Romanian officials being seconded to Ireland will be to act as liaison officers between the Romanian and Irish authorities. In particular, they will assist with the smooth operation of the re-admission agreement by, for example: liaising with the authorities in Bucharest on arrangements for the return of persons who are to be deported; and assisting in efforts being taken by both states to tackle illegal <Col N="814" /> trafficking in people by the exchange of information and other initiatives.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the proposed strengthening of liaison and co-operation arrangements between the Irish and Romanian authorities will not, in any way, affect the integrity of the asylum and immigration systems.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, already incorporates the principle of non-refoulement which means that a person shall not be expelled from the state or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Furthermore, the Act provides that a person's freedom shall be regarded as being threatened, if, <i>inter-alia</i>, in the opinion of the Minister, the person is likely to be subject to a serious assault.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner and I are totally committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse, including heroin abuse. As recent events have shown, the most serious problems associate with drug abuse in this country are caused by heroin.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Government's policy of tough legislation, backed up by strong law enforcement measures, in tandem with a multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage will, I believe, ultimately prove successful.</P>
      <P>Strong legislation, such as the Criminal Justice, Act, 1999, has been put in place which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. Other important legislation, which I introduced while in Opposition, is the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which has been utilised very effectively by the Criminal Assets Bureau in order to successfully confiscate the ill-gotten gains of drug traffickers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are successfully targeting the problem of drug dealing at both a national and local level. Between January 1998 and December 1999, drug seizures amounting to a notional street value in excess of £120 million were made. In the same period, Garda operations, such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet, to combat on-street drug dealing have also been extremely effective resulting in the seizure of illicit drugs with a notional street value in <Col N="815" /> excess of £20 million and in over 20,000 arrests being made.</P>
    <P>Of course, I have always operated on the basis that there is a co-relation between crime and social depravation and that the drugs problem cannot be solved by law enforcement measures alone and I have endeavoured to ensure that my Department and An Garda Síochána are among the main contributors to the development of multi-agency integrated policies to deal with the drugs problem at a national and local level. I am a member of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion which gives political leadership to these policies and both my Department and An Garda Síochána have enthusiastically supported and been actively involved along with other statutory agencies and the community and voluntary sector, in the national drugs strategy team and the local drugs task forces which have contributed so much at local level.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the recent tragic deaths, I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Health and Children that a European wide alert was issued in relation to admissions to hospitals in Glasgow of injecting drug users, on 19 May last. This alert came to the Eastern Regional Health Authority through the National Disease Surveillance Centre in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is investigating a number of deaths and severe illnesses among drug abusers and is working closely with the authorities in Glasgow and the National Disease Surveillance Centre.</P>
    <P>The Garda have informed me that they are also investigating a number of deaths associated with drug misuse. The gardaí are working in consultation with the Eastern Region Health Authority and a working group has been set up, comprising members of the gardaí, health officials, medical practitioners and State pathologists to assist in the investigation.</P>
    <P>The Garda investigation, which is ongoing, has been extensive and toxicology analyses have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are working in close liaison with both the Eastern Region Health Authority and health and law enforcement authorities in Glasgow on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft anti-racism protocol for political parties and the draft declaration of intent for candidates in elections are recent initiatives being developed by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism &ndash; NCCRI &ndash; as part of its overall aim of developing an integrated approach against racism. As the Deputy will be aware, I established the NCCRI in 1998 with functions which include the promotion of a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as refugees. Travellers and minority ethnic groups in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The NCCRI has informed me that it recently met the general secretaries of the four main political parties about a range of issues including the concept of developing an initiative such as a protocol specifically linked to the conduct of candidates during elections. Subsequently a draft protocol for political parties and a draft declaration of intent for candidates for elections were circulated to the general secretaries requesting their comments. Letters were also sent to the Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Socialist Party and the four Independent Deputies seeking their support.</P>
      <P>This initiative is modelled on a Europe-wide initiative called the charter of political parties for a non-racist society, which is supported by the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia.</P>
      <P>Political parties who sign the anti-racism protocol must undertake to ensure that election campaigns are conducted in such a way that they do not incite hatred or prejudice on the grounds of race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins, religious belief and membership of the travelling community. Similarly, candidates for elections who are signatories to the declaration of intent undertake to ensure that election campaigns are conducted in such a way that they do not incite hatred or prejudice on the same grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the protocol and the declaration documents are still at the drafting stage and as I indicated earlier, all parties are being consulted regarding their content. The initiative is an excellent one and I have no hesi<Col N="818" /> tation in urging all parties and candidates to sign the documents when the final texts have been developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are specific legislative provisions applying to family law proceedings (Family Home Protection Act, 1976, Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, Family Law Act, 1995, Domestic Violence Act, 1996 and Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996) which require the court to hold proceedings otherwise than in public. There is also, of course, a general provision in the law which gives the court discretion in other family law proceedings to hold them otherwise than in public and the general practice is to invoke this discretion. My Department continues to keep the law in this area under review.</P>
      <P>In its 1996 report on family courts, the Law Reform Commission affirmed the importance of the right to privacy in family law cases on the basis that they frequently involve detailed discussion of personal relationships. However, the Commission recommended that access by a bona fide researcher to such proceedings should be allowed by a judge subject to refusal only on the basis of compelling and stated reasons and that the attendance of students of family law should be allowed at the discretion of the judge. The commission's report was preceded by a consultation paper of 1994. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Law Reform Commission's recommendations fall far short of any major relaxation of the in camera rule, as it is called, for family law proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its sixth report, the working group on a courts commission, established to review the operation of the courts, expressed support for the Law Reform Commission's proposal. It stated that a balance should be found between the right of privacy of litigants and children in family law cases and the right to a fair, transparent and accountable system of justice in the area. It also stated that policy reform, research, accountability and provision of adequate services cannot take place without accurate statistics from the courts on a regular basis. With these aims in mind it recommended that a pilot project be set up for a period of one year whereby a researcher, who could be a barrister or a solicitor, would be appointed to work in the area. Such a researcher would have access to the family courts but would <Col N="819" /> have the responsibility of ensuring that there would be no breach of the right to privacy of the individual litigant.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Courts Service, which now has responsibility for the management of the courts and the provision of information on the courts system to the public, is currently examining the matter with a view to establishing as soon as possible a pilot project as recommended by the working group on a courts commission.</P>

      <P>The report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees, which was published last December, emphasised the importance of promoting a tolerant inclusive society. The working group's report has been accepted by Government as the framework for refugee integration policy in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> One of the working group's recommendations related to public awareness. The working group recommended that the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism, NCCRI should have a central role in co-ordinating public awareness initiatives and in disseminating information on anti-racism issues and respect for cultural diversity. The Government has agreed on the need for initiatives to combat racism and racist attacks through informing public opinion and promoting a more tolerant inclusive society. It has approved proposals for an evaluation of the working group strategy and the resources needed to plan, implement and review the development of such initiatives, within a very short time frame. The NCCRI is carrying out this evaluation. The evaluation is due to be completed in the near future and I hope to be able to bring proposals for comprehensive public awareness initiatives to Government before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The NCCRI, which I established in 1998, assists the integration of refugees in other ways. Its programme includes the monitoring of the legal aid service for asylum seekers, organising anti-racism training modules for civil servants and administering a small grants fund to non-government organisations undertaking anti-racism-intercultural projects. The NCCRI has a number of sub-committees, one of which deals exclusively with issues concerning refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Last November the NCCRI in conjunction with the UNHCR organised a programme of events which focused on the inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers, people of colour and ethnic minorities into Irish society. The two-week programme, entitled True Colours, consisted of a wide range of different types of events at national, regional and local levels, including a film festival, workshops, seminars and the launching of publications. The organisers encouraged the participation of community groups, schools and other organisations and a small grant fund was set up to support non-statutory groups who became involved in the programme</P>
    <P>In its strategic plan 2000-02 the NCCRI states that it will seek to build on its previous work on refugee and asylum policy and to develop new competencies on immigration and citizenship policy. In particular the NCCRI will seek to work towards the active inclusion of asylum seekers in integration policy and develop mechanisms for the participation of organisations working with minority ethnic groups in the design, implementation and review of service delivery.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, came into operation last October. The Act provides protection against discrimination in employment and training on a number of grounds including religion, race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins. The Equal Status Act, 2000, will provide protection from discrimination outside the employment context, including education, in the provision of goods, services and accommodation and the disposal of property, on the same grounds as the Employment Equality Act. The <Col N="821" /> Equal Status Act was signed on the 26 April and, it is hoped, will come into operation next October.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, indictable crime statistics can be found in the annual reports of An Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details the crime statistics for 1998. While Garda crime statistics for 1999 have not yet been formally published, I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional statistics for that year indicate that 38 murders were recorded, and proceedings have been commenced in 24 of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, as of 30 May 2000 of the 21 murders recorded this year proceedings have <Col N="822" /> commenced in 11 cases.

The annual report of an Garda Síochána will contain the final figures in respect of 1999 when it is published later in the year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the motivation behind these crimes, while the term 'gangland killing' is widely used by the media, it does not correspond to the manner in which Garda Síochána classify crime. All murders are the subject of exhaustive investigation by the Garda regardless of the circumstances of how they occurred. The House will appreciate that I do not wish to jeopardise the successful investigation and prosecution of these serious crimes by making any comment as to the motives that lay behind them, as the identification of the motive and the gathering of evidence of these crimes are key elements of the investigation and prosecution functions.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that although most areas in the country experience some form of begging, the most prevalent area where this is organised is Dublin city centre. A number of gardaí attached to the Pearse Street, Harcourt Terrace and Store Street Garda stations have been appointed to liaise with the ISPCC's Leanbh initiative. Ongoing daily contact takes place and monthly meetings are held.</P>
      <P>Gardaí and Leanbh personnel have identified the majority of families whose children beg. Leanbh outreach personnel work with them in a holistic way on an outreach basis. I understand that many of the children found begging are in the seven to eight year age bracket. I understand that these children are taken off the street by gardaí or Leanbh volunteers and returned to their homes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, the various health boards are also notified. I understand that the ISPCC inform both the Garda and the relevant health board in writing as a matter of course, and follow up with visits to the families by their own Leanbh outreach workers.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by me and by the staff in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management are also implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an E-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will improve over a period of time. I can also inform the Deputy that the amount of surplus funds arising from operations in the Land Registry in 1999, in cash accounting terms under Government accounting rules, was £3.9 million. I should point out however, that this figure would not be a true reflection of the position in that charges borne by other Departments for the Land Registry for matters such as rent, pensions etc. are not reflected in that figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is currently processing an application under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, from Greenore Ferry Services Limited, to dump a maximum amount of 175,000 tonnes of dredge spoil at sea from renovations and an extension of the Quay Wall at Greenore Ferry Port to cater better for business. An application under the Foreshore Acts has also been submitted by the company for this development. Phase 1 of the project involves the disposal of 35,000 tonnes, maximum, of this spoil. Phase 2 of the project, which involves extensive dredging and expansion works, will require a full environmental impact statement, which is being commissioned at present by the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my Department's assessment of all such applications, a full and detailed analysis of the material for dumping was carried out and showed that some of the material, 5,000 tonnes approximately, was contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls. While the level of the contamination is quite low, over 300 times less than that <Col N="825" /> found in the blubber of marine mammals off the west coast of Ireland, it is my Department's opinion that the material should be removed from the marine environment and, in consultation with the applicant, the EPA, and scientific advisers, a practicable and environmentally sound means of dealing with the matter was devised. This entails the placing of the contaminated material in concrete behind the new quay wall, in a manner which will ensure that it is isolated from the marine environment. This work will be closely monitored throughout by my Department which is satisfied that there will be no adverse impact on fisheries in the area. It is the considered view of my Department, which has actively sought to have the contaminated material properly dealt with, that containment is the best environmental option available. To do nothing, and leave the contaminated material exposed to the elements, is in contravention of marine environmental policy which requires that all possible steps be taken to restore marine areas which have been adversely affected.</P>
    <P>My Department has not yet completed its consideration as regards the dumping at an offshore site of the remaining phase 1 material, namely, 30,000 tonnes of clean material, consideration of phase 2 must await full assessment and publication of the EIS. Objections from local fishermen have been received and these are being considered by my Department and its expert advisers. The Deputy can be assured that when processing a permit to dump at sea, full consideration is given to the likely effects of the proposed dredging and dumping on the marine environment, including fisheries and other users. Arrangements are in place for consultation with the public and statutory consultees and all objections are fully considered prior to any decision being made. Arrangements have been made in this instance to meet with objectors to discuss the possibility of altering the proposed dumpsite, if deemed necessary, and-or curtailing or timing the dumping operation in a manner which could minimise any possible adverse impacts.</P>

      <P>The overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force is based on the report of a special steering group established by me in January 1998. The group produced its report in September 1999, and the recommendations contained in the report have been accepted as a general basis on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed. As I have indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that an in-depth study of the reserve has now been undertaken involving a considerable amount of work by both the military board and the steering group. The military board, as part of its task sought the views of the membership on the future organisation and structure of the reserve. From the outset there was ongoing liaison between the steering group and the military board and meetings of the steering group were attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who kept the group well briefed on the board's progress. The steering group also advised the military board regarding aspects of the reserve that should be examined or that should be looked at in greater depth by the military board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and it met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force <Col N="827" /> representative association which also made presentations to the group.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government on 20 February, An Slua Muirí will be developed to improve the capacity of members to provide a genuine naval reserve capacity based on a revised overall strength of up to 400 personnel and as a rationalisation measure it has been decided to amalgamate the two Dublin based companies of An Slua Muirí. It is not proposed to relocate a unit of An Slua Muirí to Drogheda.</P>

      <P>Under the current headage scheme farmers receive payment based on the type of livestock on their holdings up to an overall limit of £4000. For example, suckler cows attract a payment of £84 per cow up to a maximum of 40 cows in the more severely handicapped area and £75 per cow up to a maximum <Col N="828" /> of 30 in the less severely handicapped area while in the sheep sector hogget ewes were paid £12 each and mountain breeding ewes £11 each up to a maximum of 200 sheep. Other payment rates apply to equines, goats and other bovines.</P>
      <P>I have now submitted proposals seeking European Commission agreement for an area based compensatory allowance scheme to be introduced next year.  The rates being proposed are as follows:</P>
      <P>More Severely Handicapped Areas &ndash;</P>
      <P>Suckler Cow enterprises: 106.65 euro/£84 per eligible hectare up to a maximum of 40 hectares.</P>
      <P>Other Cattle enterprises: 44.44 euro/£35 per eligible hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares, small dairy enterprises to qualify on up to ten hectares-each 876 gallons of milk quota being equivalent to one eligible hectare</P>
      <P>In the Less Severely Handicapped Area and Coastal Areas &ndash;</P>
      <P>Suckler Cow enterprises: 95.23 euro/£75 per eligible hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.</P>
      <P>All Disadvantaged Areas &ndash;</P>
      <P>Sheep enterprises* (mountain breeding ewes and hogget ewes) on mountain land: 143.89 euro/£113.33 per eligible hectare.</P>
      <P>Lowland Sheep enterprises* (breeding ewes and hogget ewes): 59.24 euro/£46.66 per eligible hectare.</P>
      <P>*Subject to a maximum of 30 hectares or one hectare for each Livestock Unit where quota is less than 200. On both mountains and lowlands, hogget ewes may not comprise more than 25% of the animals qualifying for payment.</P>
      <P>Goats enterprises: 84.64 euro/£66.66 per eligible hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.</P>
      <P>Equine enterprises: 88.88 euro/£70 for first eight eligible hectares, 83.80 euro/£66 per eligible hectare thereafter up to a maximum of 30 hectares.</P>
      <P>In cattle, goat and equine enterprises the individual scheme limits remain the same. However for mountain sheep enterprises the existing limit of £2,200 increases to £3,400. In order that producers with a mix of cattle and sheep can benefit from the increased rates in the sheep sector I am proposing to increase the existing overall individual ceiling from £4,000 to £5,000.</P>

      <Quest>his view on the low levels of blood donations in this country at present; the steps he will take to address the situation; if elective surgery has been postponed due to diminishing blood stock levels; if so, the scale of the problem in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that on occasions there are difficulties with the blood supply and that, as a consequence, elective surgery was postponed recently in a small number of hospitals. However, I am pleased to advise that there is now sufficient blood stocks available to meet hospital requirements over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Transfusion services internationally continue to experience difficulties in meeting the demand for blood. Constant effort is needed to maintain donations at an adequate level to meet service needs and to manage seasonal variations in blood supply. In this country approximately 100,000 donors give blood annually. I have met blood donors since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children and I am fully aware of their pride in supporting people in need and in their practical commitment to donating blood on a regular basis despite the time and inconvenience involved. I would like to acknowledge their altruism and the major contribution their voluntary efforts make to improving the health of so many patients and sustaining important elements of our hospital services.</P>
      <P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is implementing a major campaign through the media at national and local levels to advise of blood supply difficulties and to encourage more donors to come forward and attend local blood collection clinics. Blood donors have responded generously and speedily to this campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I encourage donors to continue to give blood on a regular basis particularly over the summer months when the level of donations tends to decrease due to holiday commitments. Approximately, 15,000 new donors are required on an annual basis and I would also encourage new <Col N="832" /> donors to come forward and replace donors who retire or are unable to continue to donate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 to 89, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Section 18(4) of the Coroners Act, 1962, provides <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;every medical practitioner who has reason to believe that the deceased person died, whether directly or indirectly from any reason other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death, or in such circumstances as may require investigation, including death as the result of the administration of an anaesthetic, shall immediately notify the Coroner within whose district the body is of the fact and circumstances relating to the death&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I announced on 9 February 2000 my intention to hold an inquiry to review all post mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970. It is my opinion that the facts of this case, and any similar cases, would fall within the terms of reference of the inquiry which I recently announced. Consequently, I do not consider it appropriate to make any further comment on individual cases at this stage. I trust the Deputy will appreciate the view that the independence of the Inquiry is of critical importance and must be respected as such.</P>
      <P>However, it is my view that any parent seeking information in relation to post mortem examinations performed on their child is entitled to obtain such information as soon as possible and in a manner which is sensitive, comprehensive and which meets their needs. The Eastern Regional Health Authority are pursuing this matter with the hospital management to ensure that a comprehensive answer on the matters raised by the Deputy is provided to the family in question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that I am informed that the death certificate for the child referred to is now available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I would like to express my sympathies to the parents concerned and I am sorry for the <Col N="834" /> additional trauma and renewed grief which they are experiencing.</P>

      <P>Work is ongoing to develop a set of performance indicators appropriate to the Irish health care system. This work is being carried out in the context of the service plans framework. A preliminary set of priority performance indicators has been developed by my Department in conjunction with the health boards. Health boards have been asked to report on these in their service plans for 2001. Meanwhile work is continuing in my Department and among health board chief executive officers to further refine a set of performance indicators which will be feasible, appropriate, timely and fair. To support this project the Department has commissioned the Institute of public administration to carry out research on the development of a performance measurement framework for the health services.</P>
      <P>Since 1995, my Department has produced and disseminated a public health information system, PHIS. This system is part of a continuing programme at national level in close collaboration with the public health departments of the health boards to provide a minimum common data set of reliable baseline data for the assessment of health at national, health board and county levels. Many high level indicators of performance in areas such as mortality, births, hospitalisation and cancer incidence are contained in the PHIS, and the system is used widely at national and health board levels to report on health status and to inform service planning. The PHIS is subject to continuous review and development, and the fourth annual version of the system is due for release on CD-ROM within the coming month.</P>
      <P>My Department has also recently established a national health information strategy committee. The remit of this group will be to develop a strategic approach toward the achievement of a co-ordinated and integrated national health information system. This will include consideration of requirements for the further development and use of performance indicators and outcome measures as part of an integrated system for monitoring and evaluating health and the effectiveness of health services.</P>

      <P>The national development plan states the Government's commitment to the appropriate use of public private <Col N="837" /> partnerships as a means of providing for major infrastructural services in the years ahead; the plan also identifies national road improvements as a key area for PPP development. The NDP moreover provides that appropriate PPP funding structures will be examined and identified, including where appropriate road user tolls.</P>
      <P>Within this framework, the National Roads Authority have made it clear that they envisage the application of road user tolls to suitable projects within their programme. NRA have already made toll schemes in relation to the Dublin Port Tunnel and M50 Westlink (with the latter still subject to final approval).</P>
      <P>User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more prevalent instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk which is desirable in PPP projects.</P>
      <P>While use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health board. The amount paid is normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Accommodation at affordable rents is not available in all parts of the city. For example, a significant proportion of private rented accommodation is concentrated in areas where the houses are of sufficient size to accommodate multiple dwellings. It follows that people in low paid employment and others with limited means who require rented accommodation tend to find affordable accommodation only in certain parts of the city. Consequently a high proportion of claims for rent supplement arise in these parts of the city.</P>
      <P>In assessing claims for rent supplement, health boards do not discriminate against tenants on the basis of where they live. If a person meets the income and other criteria for receipt of rent supplement, then payment is made. It would not be reasonable to refuse payment on the basis of where the person lives or to require them to move to another location before payment is made.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of an interdepartmental committee on housing was published last year and the Government has decided in principle to implement its main recommendations. A new rent assistance scheme will be put in place, operated by the local authorities, to serve people who have long-term housing needs, including those who currently rely on SWA rent supplements on a long-term basis. Income support elements of the SWA scheme, including assistance with rent costs on a short-term basis, will continue to be met through the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A planning group under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been established to consult with relevant stakeholders including the local authorities and to prepare detailed proposals for the new scheme. It is expected that this will take about six months and a further two year time frame is envisaged for introducing the new <Col N="839" /> arrangements once the detailed proposals have been agreed.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit <Col N="840" /> is a weekly payment made to insured people who are out of work and who satisfy a number of qualifying conditions. The rate of payment is graduated according to the earnings of the claimant in the relevant tax year, that is, the last income tax year before the benefit year in which the claim is made. If the claimant has earnings from employment in the relevant tax year, only those earnings will be used to determine the rate of payment.</P>
      <P>Graduated rates of benefit payments were introduced in order to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created following on the extension in 1991 of full social insurance coverage to workers earning in excess of £25 per week. This income limit has since been increased to £30 per week. In the absence of graduated rates of payment, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes could have access to weekly social welfare payments which would exceed their income from employment. I would be reluctant, therefore, to introduce changes to the qualifying conditions governing entitlement to graduated rates of benefits.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that where a claimant who qualifies for a graduated rate of unemployment benefit has an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance at a higher rate of payment, it is open to him/her to opt to receive unemployment assistance in lieu of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, perhaps he would let me have the relevant details and I will arrange to have the position examined.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, sets out the provisions for the making of deportation orders. Once a deportation order is made, section 3(9)(a) of the Act requires that the person is notified to present himself or herself <Col N="842" /> to such person and at such date, time and place as may be specified for the purpose of his or her deportation from the State. Prior to the issue of this notice, travel and escort arrangements are put in place.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the Immigration Act, airline reservations have been made on foot of deportation orders in respect of a total of 198 persons, plus Garda escorts. Thirty persons have been deported to date. The remaining reservations were cancelled, at no cost to the State, when it became clear that the persons involved either were not going to turn up for deportation, initiated judicial review proceedings, were not deported on the basis of advice from the Attorney General's office or, in a small number of cases, had already left the State before the date and time notified for deportation. In a further case, it did not prove possible to obtain visas for the escorting Garda officers in order to effect the deportation.</P>

    <P>The current processing time for processing asylum applications from initial application stage to the determination of an appeal, in cases where applicants avail of the opportunity to appeal, takes between four months, manifestly unfounded cases, and two years. In cases where there is no appeal the processing time is between four to 15 months. If there is a further challenge to a deportation order and/or the asylum process, the period could extend to a further 12 to 14 months.</P>
    <P>The aim of my Department is to minimise the time taken from the date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards and enables applications to be processed within six months.</P>
    <P>A working group was established in February in the asylum operations division of my Department to examine the issue of the use of accelerated procedures to deal speedily with cases which are manifestly well founded and manifestly unfounded. Arising from the deliberations of the group, workshops have been held with the relevant staff in the case processing area of the asylum division. Instructions have issued concerning the use of such procedures. Manifestly well founded cases will be identified at an early stage to ensure that a person who is likely to succeed in the asylum process gets the benefit of refugee <Col N="843" /> status as soon as possible without being unnecessarily delayed.</P>
    <P>Manifestly unfounded procedures will help to eliminate, at an early stage, applications which appear to have little or no relevance to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.</P>
    <P>Of the 6,619 decisions made at first stage since 1992, 608, 9%, were granted refugee status and 6,011, 91%, were refused. A total of 4,535, 75% of those refused, have availed of the opportunity to appeal following refusal.</P>
    <P>Of the 4,535 appeals, 527 of those determined, 32%, have been granted and 1,125, 68% of those determined have been refused; some 422 cases were withdrawn. Decisions on the remainder have still to be finalised. While the percentage of people granted refugee status following appeal is 31% on average, it should be noted that an overall percentage of 25% would be more accurate if those who do not avail of the opportunity to appeal, those who withdraw from the process or whose applications are deemed to be abandoned are taken into account.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I am well aware that the probation and welfare service is under-resourced and every effort is being made by my Department to address the issue. As I have already indicated publicly, I have secured the sanction of the Minister for Finance for an additional 39 staff for the service. In this regard I can confirm that in the period 1 July, 1999 to 29 May, 2000, inclusive, 19 probation and welfare officers have been recruited to the service from the two recent recruitment campaigns. Arrangements are being made for other candidates to take up duty in the coming months.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons for delays in recruiting staff. These include issues such as relocation, the necessity to give notice to current employers and in many instances personal circumstances are such that candidates are not in a position to take up the posts immediately the offers are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to meet existing and anticipated staffing needs for the Probation and Welfare Service my Department is currently in the process of making arrangements with the Civil Service Commission for the holding of a further recruitment <Col N="844" /> competition in the near future. These arrangements are at an advanced stage and it is planned to announce the new competition in June and to advertise extensively including in overseas journals and newspapers. My Department is liaising with the Civil Service Commission to further streamline the competition process to ensure that new probation and welfare officers take up offers of appointment as soon as possible after interview.</P>
    <P>My Department is also working to heighten the profile of the probation and welfare service as a career option for social work graduates and in this regard availed of the recent public sector recruitment fair at the RDS on 28 May 2000 to promote the service to young graduates. It is intended to explore other opportunities to attract as many suitably qualified persons to the probation and welfare service as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that recruitment will continue until all vacancies and the new posts in the service have been filled.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is being undertaken by my Department at present. It is intended that the review will be a comprehensive one, taking into account all relevant questions and situations. Submissions for proposed changes to the scheme have been invited from relevant organisations, including Victim Support, and these submissions will receive consideration as part of the review. My Department is awaiting receipt of a small number of the submissions invited, before being in a position to complete the review. I hope to receive a report on the matter shortly.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, while the scheme is a non-statutory one, any proposals for changes to the scheme, which may be recommended as part of the review, will require the approval of Government and the revised scheme must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the director general of the Irish Prisons Service that statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. At present the compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually as there are no computerised systems in most prisons. This is an extremely time consuming and staff intensive process and it has not been possible to release staff for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new £6 million information technology programme, authorised by me, for the Prisons Ser<Col N="846" /> vice is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database will be deployed across the Prisons Service later this year. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions.</P>
    <P>The director general has informed me, however, that the number of prisoners on unstructured and unsupervised temporary release continues to fall. Some 7% of the total number serving a sentence were on temporary release on Wednesday, 10 May 2000 compared with 19.6% for the same period in 1996. The number of prisoners on unstructured temporary release will continue to fall as further new prison places become available.</P>

    <P>The implementation of the Bail Act, 1997, is expected to lead to an increase in the number in custody on remand by at least 400. In addition the number of prisoners in Mountjoy must be reduced by between 150-200 prisoners to allow the prison to be refurbished wing by wing over a period of four years and to ensure a permanent reduction in overcrowding. The gross overcrowding in Cork Prison must also be eliminated. It was designed to hold 150 offenders but currently holds 270 prisoners.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 1,277 spaces being provided under the current prisons building programme, phase 1, I also recently obtained Government approval for 700 extra prison spaces. I believe that all these spaces, when completed, will transform the Irish prison system beyond all recognition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have outlined before in the House the three essential components to the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime &ndash; first, a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime; secondly, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime and third, a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that never in the history of the State has the Garda Síochána been better resourced or equipped and Garda strength is heading towards 12,000, an all time historic high. The Government is on target for increasing the capacity of the prison system by an unprecedented amount and its tough anti-crime policies are yielding the anticipated good results with a further fall of 5% in crime figures last year lead<Col N="847" /> ing to a cumulative fall of approximately 21% since the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>My policy for dealing with drugs and organised crime is well known: it is one of strong legislation backed up by tough enforcement to tackle drug dealing and trafficking. This policy has resulted in record drug seizures, many Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled, major drug barons fleeing abroad and a high percentage of persons who are prosecuted being convicted and sentenced to prison.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has also enjoyed considerable success in its operations both at national and local level with an impressive record of seizures and an aggressive policy is being pursued by the Garda Síochána in obtaining evidence to bring drug traffickers before the courts. This has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major criminals.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to think, however, that I have just focused on the enforcement side of dealing with the crime problem. I am particularly pleased to have placed increased emphasis on measures to reduce youth crime and my Department has invested significantly in preventive measures such as the Garda youth diversion projects. There were just 12 in existence when I took up office. There are now 29, and I recently announced a further ten schemes as phase one of the expansion programme funded under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I intend to expand these projects further over the coming year.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Estimates recently published by the Government for the year 2000 show that for the first time ever, spending in the Justice area, will exceed £1 billion. As the Deputy will appreciate, this level of investment is unprecedented and will pay dividends in the years to come in the fight against crime.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the use of violence and intimidation by criminals is not a new phenomenon and in cases where the victims are also involved in crime there can be major difficulties involved in investigating the crime.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that all violent crime, regardless of the circumstances involved, is the subject of a rigorous Garda investigation. The identification of the motive, such as an association with organised crime and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution processes. Speculation as to the nature of the motive could serve to jeopardise successful investigations and prosecution of serious crimes.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to recent violent incidents and he has informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards this area of criminal activity and that a continued proactive and integrated approach is taken by the Garda to the investigation of cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of organised criminals. He has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and bring those involved to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policy of tough legislation, backed up by strong law enforcement measures, has proven to be an extremely effective approach to combating organised crime. I have adopted strong legislation, such as the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. The Act has also brought in a range of other measures designed to prevent intimidation of witnesses, jurors, those assisting the Garda in the investigation of an offence and their families and provides a maximum ten year prison sentence upon conviction of these offences. Another importance piece of legislation, which I introduced while in opposition, is the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 which has been utilised very effectively by the <Col N="849" /> Criminal Assets Bureau in order to successfully confiscate the moneys earned through criminal activities.</P>
    <P>The establishment of specialist Garda units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, and the Garda National Drug Unit has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively.</P>

It is proposed to construct a Garda station at Leixlip and to relocate Carbury Garda station to Derrinturn and the Office of Public Works is seeking suitable sites for these stations. It is expected that work will commence later this year on an extension to and the refurbishment of Athy Garda station.

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that major developments in the area of technology for the Garda have been ongoing in recent years.</P>
      <P>Development work on the new Garda IT systems known as the PULSE project began in August 1996 and was expected to take four years to complete. The aim of this project is to provide the Garda with state-of-the-art systems in 17 operational areas. Much of the development work involved original design of software and systems. Work on the first two planned releases was completed last year and these are being rolled out to Garda stations. In the meantime, planning and design of a further two releases for later this year is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The new PULSE system, which has been installed in 181 Garda stations/offices throughout the country, represents a major change in how gardaí record incidents and crimes and a major feature of the PULSE project is to equip and skill all members of the Garda to use the systems.</P>
      <P>The existing Garda radio network will soon be replaced with a new digital trunked radio system constructed to the EU TETRA standard. Work on this project is progressing and it is hoped that a pilot system will be operational early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> The Garda telephone network is currently being upgraded from analogue to digital systems which support facilities including direct dial inwards, DDI, and calling line identification, CLI. Plans are in place to establish a call handling control facility in the Dublin area enabling the public to contact any Garda station in the area by dialling one number. It is also planned to extend this type of facility countrywide.</P>
    <P>An air support unit, including a fixed wing aircraft and helicopter equipped with the most modern technology, has been introduced. A second helicopter is also being provided. This will greatly expand the area of operations of the air support unit and allow for 24 hour availability of air support in the ongoing fight against crime.</P>
    <P>A high speed patrol boat for use by the Garda water unit in policing inland waterways was launched last month. The boat is equipped with sophisticated navigational and tactical equipment which will greatly enhance the crime fighting capability of the Garda Síochána. The boat has, for example, the latest modern communications equipment which can link directly with the Garda air support unit, thereby ensuring the Garda Síochána has an extensive array of technology to assist them in the fight against all types of crime, whether on land, water or air.</P>
    <P>Garda closed circuit television schemes, CCTV, as aids to policing, have been introduced in Dublin and Tralee. The system in Dublin is currently being extended to include Grafton Street and its surrounding areas. A CCTV system is also being installed in Cork city. A review of CCTV is being carried out and is expected to be completed soon. Its findings will then be submitted to me for consideration. I expect that these findings will assist in facilitating and accelerating the installation of additional Garda CCTV systems in the future.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive programme of in-service training in English and Gaeilge is in course of delivery as part of the primary curriculum support programme. In addition to a two-day &ldquo;Introduction to the Primary Curriculum&rdquo; seminar, the teaching staff of every primary school attended a two-day seminar on either English or Gaeilge. These seminars were held outside schools and each was followed by a planning day within schools to enable them to plan for implementation of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>As a follow-up to training provided during the current school year, there will be further support for schools in the language area of the curriculum during the coming school year when the training programme will provide for a language support day for each school. Trainers will also provide on-going support to schools, which will be tailored to the needs of the particular school. In this way, schools will be given time to develop a comprehensive curriculum plan which will address all aspects of curriculum implementation, including measures to improve literacy.</P>
      <P>As well as support provided by the primary curriculum support programme, the education centre network will play an important role in developing courses to meet the needs of teachers and schools in relation to implementing their curriculum plans within the context of the revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>The school development planning initiative introduced by my Department during the current school year provides a further source of support to schools in addressing their particular developmental needs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, a substantial range of in-service courses is provided for learning support, remedial, teachers including a one year diploma course and many courses of a shorter duration. My Department financially supports all of these courses.</P>

      <P>A national survey of all primary and post-primary schools was commenced by the Radiological Institute of Ireland, RPII, in 1998 at the request of my Department, following indications of a problem with high radon levels in some schools. This survey involves monitoring the radon gas level in each ground floor classroom oven an academic year. A number of counties were surveyed over the 1998-99 academic year. Schools in Dublin have been surveyed over the current academic year, 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>I understand that second level schools involved in the current phase of the survey have begun to return the detectors to the RPII for processing. The detectors from primary schools will no doubt be returned in early July. The RPII expect to be in a position to issue the results to each school later this year.</P>
      <P>The results of the first phase of the national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow were issued to the schools concerned earlier this year.</P>
      <P>These results indicated that none of the rooms tested in 511 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200, Bq/m3, above which remedial action is advised. Of the remaining 174 schools, the RPII advised that 13 schools, showing the highest level of radon, require attention as soon as possible. My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. The mitigation programmes for five of these schools have been completed. The consultant has prepared mitigation programmes for the remaining eight schools. It is planned that the necessary works will be undertaken during the school summer holidays.</P>
      <P>The mitigation programme for these schools has primarily involved the installation of sub-floor depressurisation chambers, commonly known as sumps, linked by piping to fans in order to trap and lead away the radon gas before it enters the affected building. The consultant will then consider and advise on the most suitable mitigation programme for the remaining less-affected schools. In the absence of the advice of the consultant I cannot say at this juncture what the nature of these measures will be or when they will be undertaken. I am pleased to say that the full cost of the mitigation programme will be borne by my Department.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of bachelor of education.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for grant assistance a candidate must satisfy the relevant conditions of the student support schemes in regard to age, residence, means and nationality. The candidate in question should be advised to apply to Kilkenny County Council to have his eligibility for grant assistance assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants are not payable in respect of tuition fees paid in respect of attendance at courses outside of Ireland. However, since the introduction, in 1998, of undergraduate tuition fees in the UK <Col N="860" /> students from this State can apply to the relevant authorities in the UK for grant assistance towards their undergraduate tuition fee. I understand that students who apply through the universities and colleges admission services, UCAS, for courses in England and Wales receive a preliminary assessment form which must be completed and returned to the appropriate authorities in order that their eligibility may be assessed. The candidate in question should be advised to complete and return this form to the relevant authorities without delay.</P>
    <P>Since 1999-2000 tax relief is available at the standard rate of tax for tuition fees paid for full-time qualifying undergraduate courses in publicly funded universities or similar third level colleges in any EU member state. Further details on claiming this relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <P>Every year, my Department examines over 1.5 million scripts, practical pieces and other test products. It has not proved logistically feasible to facilitate the return of this quantity of examination material to candidates on an individual basis. Through the co-operation of school authorities it has proved possible to provide leaving certificate students with an opportunity to view their marked scripts although initially school authorities had reservations about storage and other issues.</P>
      <P>The basic difficulty is our total reliance in Ireland on external assessment at junior certificate that in turn necessitates the movement of some practical pieces from schools to the Department. In other countries students' project and practical work is assessed by their own teachers and, consequently, the work is readily available in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing review of junior cycle my Department issued a discussion paper advocating changes in the approach to assessment at junior certificate. Ultimately, it is in the context of overall reform at junior cycle that improve<Col N="861" /> ments such as that suggested by the Deputy can be advanced.</P>

      <P>The higher diploma in education provided in approved third level colleges, is an approved course for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Under the terms of that scheme, grantholders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as an integral part of their course may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Where the college requires a grantholder in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant to relocate from his or her residence in order to undertake a placement of not less than <Col N="862" /> one academic term/semester, the non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid for the duration of such placement. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to teaching practice is that it is not a paid activity in any institution but rather is viewed as training rather than employment. It is an integral part of the curriculum of the higher diploma in education and there is no special financial assistance available to students for this aspect of their course.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context, and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his or her course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1996, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior <Col N="863" /> to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
    <P>In December last, in response to a number of representations, local authorities and vocational education committees were advised that grant-holders should be given the option of having their grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying. This <Col N="864" /> concession allows students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts rather than sterling if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While I appreciate the current exchange rate difficulties with sterling, I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the EU. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>
