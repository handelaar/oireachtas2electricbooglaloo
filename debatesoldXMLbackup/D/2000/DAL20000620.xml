      <P>The 2010 committee report was presented to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on 24 March. It contains a considerable number of recommendations and findings. The Minister is undertaking a round of consultations with the representative organisations, including the Central Statistics Office and other bodies, on these findings and recommendations in the period ahead. It would be inappropriate to take a definitive position on any individual proposal until these consultations are completed. It is expected the consultations will be completed by the end of June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The monthly live register figures show how many people are claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or signing for social welfare credits. At the end of May there were 152,871 persons on the live regis<Col N="786" /> ter. The results are normally published within a week, making the live register a widely used short-term indicator. The Central Statistics Office's monthly releases contain a considerable amount of detail at local level, including breakdowns of the number of claimants by sex, age group and type.</P>
      <P>However, the live register does not measure unemployment on a basis that is comparable over time or between countries. It is an administrative measure and the figures reflect people's benefit status as distinct from their labour force status. It includes many people who are not unemployed, for example, part-time workers who are entitled under the social welfare rules to sign on in respect of days when they do not have work.</P>
      <P>The primary source of comparable statistics on unemployment is the quarterly national household survey. This provides quarterly figures on employment and unemployment which meet the ILO's guidelines for internationally comparable labour force statistics. Now that the main results of this survey are being published within three months, the CSO has established a labour market statistics liaison group which will advise the office on how its labour market publications can best meet the needs of data users. This will include the continuing publication of live register statistics as well as more detailed results from the quarterly national household survey. There are no plans to discontinue the publication of the live register in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of the 152,871 people on the live register are seasonal or part-time workers and how many sign on for credits? In other words, how many people are continuously unavailable for work?</P>
      <P>A key statistic to emerge from the most recent set of monthly figures is the 50,000 people, many of whom live in some of the most deprived areas of the city, who are on long-term unemployment. When commenting on this matter, the Tánaiste stated she would give significant consideration to the needs of these people. The northside partnership, of which I am a director, discovered that many of the 50,000 unemployed people to whom I refer may suffer from some form of disability, are recovering from addiction or have experienced other major long-term problems. What action does the Minister of State intend to take to provide these people with employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of people registered as unemployed on the quarterly national household survey is 81,500, of which 29,500 could be said to be in the long-term category. Three years ago, that figure was 86,000 but it has since decreased to 29,500 indicating a considerable reduction of well over 50% in the level of long-term unemployment. We are beginning to target the hard core of long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about part-time workers and the number of such workers is 23,200. Some 24,100 people are not in receipt of a payment, <Col N="787" /> 13,200 of whom are signing for credits. The balance of people in receipt of payment for a full week is 105,600. One is essentially comparing two measures here, namely the live register and the quarterly national household survey which is the more accurate measure of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the live register is quite redundant as a means of measuring unemployment? Will the Government consider renaming that useful statistic as a breakdown of those in receipt of social welfare benefits relating to employment? Many people on the live register are employed part-time in a capacity which they choose and are not seeking other employment. Does the Department gather any statistics on people, particularly women in the home, who might seek to be in the jobs market but who are not currently counted on any register or survey? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>An argument could be made that the live register is a redundant means of measuring unemployment and a survey is currently being undertaken on that matter. In 1986, the gap between the live register and the quarterly national household survey was only 5,000 but grew to 90,000 in 1996.</P>
      <P>It has been baldly stated in recent years that the live register is not a measure of unemployment and that the quarterly national household survey, which has been in existence since 1997, is the new measure of unemployment as it is a rolling, week to week indicator in which people describe their own status. To that extent, the live register could be said to be redundant as a measure of unemployment. However, the live register includes many different groups of people who, for various reasons, do not describe themselves as being unemployed and, for that reason, it would be useful to retain it. Its title is another matter and I will listen to any suggestions the Deputy may have in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some part-time and occasional workers sign on when they are not employed. As a result of the equality legislation introduced in the mid 1980s, the number of women entitled to sign on increased without any change occurring in their labour force status. The introduction of signing on as an eligibility requirement for subsequent participation in employment or training schemes, changes in the rules and practices in regard to means testing, changes in the level of unemployment assistance and benefit and arrangements for the splitting of entitlements between spouses are some of the reasons, with which the Deputy will be familiar, which throw up these differences. The title of the live register is a debatable issue but its content is a useful body of data.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is a useful body of data. Will the Minister of State respond to the final part of my question? It is abundantly clear that there is a shortage of workers in the economy and it is also abundantly clear to those knocking on doors in recent times that a significant number of women in the home would love to return to the labour market after years of absence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent analysis indicates that the number of dwelling units for which permission has been granted in 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 is considerably understated in the statistics released by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review has started into the discrepancy and is still in progress. The planning permissions data published by the CSO are derived from data supplied by the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála and the inquiry will look at all stages of the <Col N="789" /> process of compilation of the data. It is expected that revised figures will be available within the next four weeks or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State confirm that the figure published by the Central Statistics Office for planning applications approved for the four Dublin local authorities and the mid-east region was just over 6,000 planning applications for residential projects when the actual adjusted figure, on investigation by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, was three times that number? If that is a fact, can the Minister explain how this figure was under-estimated by 300%? A long inquiry into that gathering of data should have been concluded by now and an explanation available to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very well informed. The figures he has given the House are broadly accurate. The Central Statistics Office figure was 6,000 for the period while the Department of the Environment and Local Government's figure was approximately 18,000. There appears to be an understatement of approximately 12,000 for the Dublin and mid-east regions. The Deputy is broadly correct in that regard.</P>
      <P>I take a very serious view of this. I asked the director of the Central Statistics Office to meet me yesterday afternoon and we had a long discussion with officials. I have asked for a very quick and urgent investigation into this matter and I understand this is taking place. On Friday morning next there will be a meeting between the CSO and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to see precisely how this understatement took place and to make sure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>The CSO has a long standing reputation for accuracy. When the Office inadvertently gives inaccurate information it is corrected very quickly and publicly, as has been done on this occasion. Pending the meeting on Friday, it is too early to allocate blame. One view is that An Bord Pleanála and/or the local authorities, over a long period, understated the information they supplied to the Central Statistics Office, but no doubt officials in those bodies would dispute that. I hope the meeting on Friday will clarify precisely how the understatement was brought about.</P>
      <P>I take a serious view of the matter. One cannot have discrepancies of this order when one is planning the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept, considering residential accommodation and housing is probably the most crucial political issue at the moment, that statistics of this type are crucial if accurate and proper planning of housing needs is to be undertaken by Government and agencies which have responsibility in this regard? Does he accept that it is scandalous if information is so completely inaccurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> In the light of his acceptance that the figures are inaccurate to the magnitude I have described, has any recheck been done of figures for other regions? Can the Minister of State assure the House that the statistics published for the other regions and in the past are accurate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the discrepancy may have occurred systematically over a long period. If that is the case I take an even more serious view of it. That is one of the matters to be discussed at the meeting on Friday next.</P>
      <P>While these figures are an important measure of construction activity and so on, they are not the only measure.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government publishes housing statistics. ESB connections are published regularly. It is not as if these figures are relied on for major macroeconomic planning. They are used but not relied on completely in the sense that there are other measures. What appears to have happened over a period, which is cause for concern, is that the various checks and balances in the system between the Central Statistics Office and the Department of the Environment and Local Government have broken down, perhaps over quite a long time, I am sorry to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State telling the House he relies more on the ESB than on his Department and the Central Statistics Office to provide the housing statistics? Can he answer the question on the veracity of the published figures for other regions? Can he stand over the published figures or does the information he has supplied to the House undermine the veracity of the figures for the rest of the country as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no indication at this stage that there is any difficulty with the other regions but I have asked, and will again ask, the director of the CSO to double check that, given the information which has been brought to light. In view of the Deputy's question, I will ask for that to be done. I have no reason to believe at this stage that there is any difficulty with them. I am not relying on ESB connections. This is not the only measure of housing activity on which the State relies.</P>

      <Quest>when a decision on the construction of additional gas line capacity into the State will be made; if the Department has completed its analysis on whether a second gas pipeline linking this State to Scotland, as proposed by Bord Gáis Éireann, is compatible with a new pipeline from Belfast to Dublin; and if a decision on which of these pipes is to proceed will be necessary.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has applied for consent to build a second gas interconnector from Scotland but has yet to furnish the necessary detailed supporting material. I am aware that in Northern Ireland three separate proposers are working on a North-South gas project and there is a further one proposed for east-west. One of these three, Premier Transmission Limited, has just announced that, following an open season process on its proposed Belfast-Dublin pipeline, it is proceeding with the next phase of the project involving preliminary engineering and environmental work on the route. The development potential of the Corrib field is also highly relevant to the question of additional gas capacity.</P>
      <P>My primary interest is in seeing that the next increment of gas capacity is put in place in time to meet market demand. For the long-term, I also want to ensure gas supply is as competitive as possible. Consultants are advising me on an economically efficient approach to pipeline authorisation for a liberalised market and on gas transmission tariffs. I expect their final report shortly which I intend to publish. This report and the decisions made on foot of it will greatly clarify the context of decisions about major pipeline projects. I intend to take this matter forward without unreasonable delay and it is very necessary that I do so.</P>
      <P>As to the specific question, if it can be assumed that the Corrib field is commercial and will be developed, it is unlikely that two further projects will proceed in a similar timeframe. I would prefer that, as far as possible, market mechanisms will determine which projects will proceed and when, once the policy background has been clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The apparent lack of urgency in the Minister of State's reply concerns me. Does he agree failure to have an adequate gas supply will undermine liberalisation and deregulation in the electricity market? Will he try to be a little more <Col N="792" /> specific about when a decision on the construction of additional gasline capacity into the State will be made? Will he, for example, try to ensure the decision on the additional gas capacity is made by the end of the year? The Minister of State referred to a recent statement which I assume is that made by Premier Transmission Limited. Is he aware that it referred to the fact that the combined expressions of interest was such a positive response from the marketplace that the board of Premier Transmission Limited has decided to move to phase two of this project, intends to sign firm transportation contracts with customers by the end of the year and award the contract for construction of the pipeline early in the second quarter of 2001? Is the Minister of State saying this is feasible? Will he try to be more specific in regard to the questions that were asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Premier Transmission Limited is but one player. A number of proposals are under consideration, including a second gas interconnector between Scotland and Ireland, a Wales-Ireland interconnector, a Belfast-Dublin pipeline to which the Deputy referred, a pipeline from Dublin to Galway and Limerick and a pipeline from the Corrib gas field off the west coast to link up with the BGE pipeline. We do not intend that there will be a failure. There is no failure to realise the implications of a delay, which the Deputy has correctly pointed out. The security of supply is paramount in my considerations and those of my senior colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise. We are being advised by consultants on this issue and regardless of the finalisation of the Corrib commercialisation, decisions will be taken by year's end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the assurance that decisions will be taken before the end of the year. Does he agree they should be taken irrespective of whether Enterprise Oil makes a decision on bringing its gas find ashore? Is the emphasis on a North-South pipeline as great as it was when the then Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, had a meeting with the Minister for Public Enterprise on this subject? Will the Minister of State confirm that the pressure in regard to North-South co-operation is as great from the North as it was when Mo Mowlam was in office?</P>

      <P>I am happy to respond positively to the Deputy and I know that subject is close to his heart. Since the Minister met Mo Mowlam, she and I have met Sir Reg Empey to discuss this issue and at that meeting we put in place an arrangement whereby Department of Public Enterprise officials and their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in the North would meet. They have met regularly to forward this issue and to cement the rapport we established with Mo Mowlam and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir <Col N="793" /> Reg Empey. The group's work is ongoing, positive and productive and it will meet again as early as next Wednesday.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the reason it is necessary to privatise either Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann to introduce competition in public transport in the greater Dublin area.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The analysis of this issue was set out in the paper entitled &ldquo;Regulation of the bus market in the greater Dublin area&rdquo; which I recently presented to the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development and public/private partnerships and circulated to all Oireachtas Members. It is proposed to establish Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann as independent companies and to remove the existing geographical restrictions on their areas of operation imposed by the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>This means that both companies will be free, along with private bus operators, to compete for franchises in the greater Dublin area. It also provides a potentially very effective way of developing real competition in the bus market in the greater Dublin area. However, there is a number of potential problems with the companies continuing in State ownership in a competitive franchised market. There is a risk of both companies becoming involved in below cost bidding to protect market share and if the State owned both companies, it would be the ultimate loser in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>A common shareholder might be tempted to discourage the two companies from competing too aggressively with each other and this could have negative implications for the competitiveness of the franchising process. There would also be a perception among potential private competitors that a State-owned company, particularly the existing dominant provider, would have an unfair advantage in any competition for franchises and this could discourage potential participants in the tendering process.</P>
      <P>Private ownership would enhance the commercial freedom of the company. The primary concern is to ensure that there is an effective competitive market for bus services in the greater Dublin area, which provides quality service and good value for money for public transport customers and a level playing field for all operators.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and for circulating the copy of her report to us. Does she agree that while there is existing <i>de facto</i> competition in part of the service, she seems to be purposely mixing up privatisation and competition? Would she agree also that as in other areas &ndash; for example, in the energy sector &ndash; there is no proposal to privatise the energy com<Col N="794" /> panies but there are definite proposals to introduce competition, and they are under way? Why is the Minister introducing a new policy trend in this case where she is arguing that it is necessary to privatise in order to introduce competition?</P>

      <P>To a very small degree, yes. We had the first meeting with the transport partnership forum last Friday week. The agenda is being set in two weeks time and the issues will then begin to be discussed. I intend to do that in a partnership manner. The issues as set out in my reply are quite clear: there is a number of potential problems with the companies continuing in State ownership in a competitive franchised market, and a common shareholder might be tempted to discourage the two companies from competing too aggressively with each other. I made these points when I replied to the Deputy and I do not want to go over them again.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I did not say this, but private ownership would enhance the commercial freedom of the company enabling it to do much better for itself. All these matters are being discussed now in the transport partnership forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister applies that argument to the generally held and accepted view, including on this side of the House, that competition should be introduced. Is she now telling the House that there has to be privatisation across the board before competition can be effective? That is a new argument that we have not heard before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is no let or hindrance on the private sector introducing competition in Dublin, if it wished to do so, in the same way as it introduced competition in rural areas? While it is technically illegal, the law is an ass in so far as it cannot be enforced. It did not prevent the private sector introducing competition on rural routes, so can the Minister explain why this has not been done in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that in that case the law is an ass given the way it is being utilised. Rural routes came about as a result of the way the word &ldquo;club&rdquo; was used in order to operate private buses. People said they were members of a club which could operate a bus. Tuam to Dublin was one of the first such services and it developed from then on. The 1932 Act lays out conditions but it is quite restrictive in how competition can operate and what routes can be used. We intend to use it initially on approxi<Col N="795" /> mately ten new routes for which bids have been submitted and then consider the rules governing the 1932 Act. However, this is still only competition of a limited nature. It is hoped to introduce the shadow regulatory authority within 12 months. However, the full regulatory authority will oversee the franchising and the full introduction of competition.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the first introduction of private sector buses to rural areas was undertaken by Fianna Fáil during an election when they were used to bring &ldquo;culchies&rdquo; home to vote? The private sector saw the potential there. Will she indicate who she thinks would buy Bus Éireann or Bus Átha Cliath? Does she agree it is likely to be one of the big British companies?</P>

      <P>Regarding the report in the<i> Irish Examiner,</i> I understand from the director of information in my Department that she intended to say the Warburg Dillon Read report mentioned two years in the context of the partial privatisation.

      <P>I will not comment on the Minister's final remark because it is becoming a mantra. I do not intend to pay much attention to that matter. The Minister said the sale of the Great Southern Hotel Group was not imminent. However, that is not what she was asked. I know the sale is not imminent for the reason I suggested. However, will it happen? Does she agree there is a suggestion that the £90,000 expenditure on consultancy regarding the Warburg Dillon Read report was a waste of money?</P>

      <P>It was not a waste of £90,000. I do not envisage the sale of the Great Southern Hotel Group. The Deputy is correct that Deputy Healy-Rae made representations on that matter, but so did Deputy Stagg and members of the trade union movement, whom I met on several occasions to discuss it. My colleagues in Government, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and others, also referred to it. There is no secret about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point I cannot predict the outcome of the meeting of the OSPAR Commission to be held in Copenhagen shortly but it presents us with a good opportunity to advance an intense campaign to bring about the eventual end of nuclear reprocessing. Ireland is not alone in seeking this objective and there is undoubtedly a strong level of solidarity among the Nordic countries and ourselves about the need to place additional pressure on both the UK and France to move away from this outmoded and hazardous activity.</P>
      <P>Both Ireland and Denmark have tabled draft decisions for discussion at the meeting. In parallel with consideration of these draft decisions, the meeting will also discuss how participating countries will implement the OSPAR strategy on radioactive substances which has as its objective the virtual elimination by 2020 of radioactive discharges into the sea. Ireland's draft decision for discussion at the meeting highlights the increased public concern following the publication of the UK nuclear installations inspectorate's report last February. It also identifies reprocessing plants as a significant source of pollution to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>I have previously stated that as a result of my contacts with Ministers in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland and my discussions with the Danish Minister in Dublin there has been some interaction concerning a potential consensus decision which could be binding on all countries, including the UK and France. If we do not achieve unanimity at the OSPAR Commission meeting, a qualified majority decision would be binding only on the countries which vote in favour of it. It is worthwhile making considerable effort at the meeting to see what can be done to secure a unanimous decision which is binding on both the UK and France. This in no way dilutes our national policy which is trenchantly opposed to Sellafield reprocessing operations and which seeks to minimise and eliminate the risk to Ireland of all nuclear activities at the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take heart from a recent report of the House of Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee on BNFL. I do not have time to elaborate on that, although I would like to do so. I hope the recommendations of the House of Commons committee, together with the international pressure being placed on the British Government at OSPAR, will give the necessary impetus to a radical rethink of the UK's nuclear reprocessing policy. I wish to see some breakthrough in our campaign against Sellafield at the OSPAR meeting but there can be no guarantee there will be the necessary shift in policy by the UK and France. There can be no doubt, however, about the strong feelings of many neighbouring countries about reprocessing activities. The Irish delegation will <Col N="798" /> work closely with other delegations to achieve a positive outcome.</P>

In conjunction with my suggestion that he should attend the meeting, will he indicate, without disclosing too much, whether it would be better and more helpful to the common cause to support the Danish proposal rather than our own? This suggestion has been made by Greenpeace.</P>

      <P>I would love if there was a ministerial dimension to the OSPAR meeting. I discussed that matter with Minister Svend Auken from Denmark when he met me in Dublin recently. As the Minister of the host country, he undertook to pursue the possibility of a ministerial segment to this session of OSPAR. I also discussed that with each of the Ministers of the other four Nordic countries whom I travelled to meet. It has now transpired there will not be a ministerial segment to that meeting, which I regret. Nevertheless, I have confidence in the personnel representing Ireland at official level. There will be a principal officer from my Department, who is vastly experienced in this area, and the deputy chief executive of the RPII, which has been representing us. I will keep in constant touch with them up to and throughout the discussions. There will be a hot line available at all times. We have been endeavouring to capitalise upon all the events that Deputy Currie has outlined. We have raised the level of the campaign and I am grateful for the co-operation I have received from this House and the other House which was not always forthcoming but without which I would not have been able to raise the campaign to the level at which it currently stands. I expect the campaign to continue. This is another mechanism to continue that strong campaign and to make it even more potent. I hope we will get a result from this OSPAR session.</P>

      <P>I put down this question because I am conscious that we are well into the period of the national development plan. Against the background of what we now know about the growth in demand and the fact that 15 years from now the number of people travelling during peak hours in the Dublin area will have doubled, from 125,000 to 500,000 &ndash; most of that increase will occur in the next few years &ndash; and given the long lead-in time for all rail projects, and conscious of our failure to provide rail infrastructure in the past and that in terms of the Luas project, which was included in the previous development plan and agreed long before it, we managed to waste the entire six years and not start it, the national development does not inspire confidence. If projects are not now identified, much less agreed to start in the current development plan, at what stage does the Minister expect to be able to adopt an overall strategic rail plan? Obviously a rail infrastructure for the city has to be an integrated one. It is not something we can proceed with piecemeal. Even if we were to proceed with one part of it, the overall plan must be in place. At what stage does the Minister envisage such a plan will be adopted? Endless plans have been published, but which one, or combination of them, will be adopted?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can make it easier for the Minister. There is an ongoing debate within Cabinet on the Luas line and how it will proceed. Is the Minister aware that failure to make a decision on line B is not only holding up work on that line but on line A? Much of the debate centres around line B, given that a future rail plan for Dublin may present difficulties for proceeding as planned with that line. At what point will a decision be made by Cabinet to sign off on line B to enable work to commence on any element of any plan? I am talking about something that was provided for in the last national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong again. I realise she is well meaning and Dublin transport needs are close to her heart. I admire her for that, but I do not know what she is talking about when she says there is a hold up in the work on line A, given that that project has gone to tender. I have Cabinet approval for lines A and B. The cars are ordered for the Luas and the judge has accepted the extra section we included. I received a letter from Judge O'Leary this morning regarding the additional section from the city centre to Connolly Station and he will deal with that when he is absolved from his work in the courts during the summer recess. A Government decision on line A and line B was made in 1998. Preliminary tenders have been accepted and major tenders will be evaluated shortly. Therefore, what the Deputy said is not true.</P>
      <P>A proposal for a metro system was put forward at a meeting of the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. That far exceeds that for which we have got Cabinet approval.</P>

There is a short-list of tenderers, but tenders have not been sought for the construction of line A or <Col N="802" /> line B. A few bushes have been removed from line B and the services are being moved to line A, but those construction projects have not been signed off by Cabinet.</P>

      <P>In the coming weeks I will closely examine the recently announced European Commission proposals for further liberalisation of the postal market with the overarching objective of ensuring the Cabinet's concerns in this area are satisfactorily met.</P>
      <P>These concerns are threefold. The Government wants Irish industry and consumers to benefit from competitively priced, high quality postal services; the nationwide postal service and network with a uniform tariff applying throughout the State must be maintained; and the Irish postal sector must develop in such a way that it will underpin the key economic objective of Ireland becoming a global e-commerce hub.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I particularly welcome the fact that, irrespective of whether privatisation is introduced, the postal service will continue. Given the Minister's earlier comments about the introduction of competition and the necessity in such circumstances to introduce privatisation, has she any plans to privatise An Post or any part of it to ensure, according to her earlier argument, effective competition? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about CIE, the Deputy asked me a question about An Post which reaches into every parish. Yesterday's newspapers carried a further announcement of major branch closures throughout the country, which I very much regret. The Cabinet has taken an informal Government decision to seek meetings with the banks to ascertain how some of the services they are abrogating in favour of moving to more central locations can be transferred to the post office network. That Government decision was taken last week. The first meeting on this matter will be held this week. I regard that as very important and I regret the banks are implementing a branch closure policy. I note that Barclays Bank and Royal Mail are coming to an amicable conclusion in similar talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Minister's populist answer that she does not propose to privatise any part of An Post because it might affect her electorally &ndash; that is my interpretation of what she meant when she said she does not intend to privatise An Post because it reaches into every part of the country &ndash; how does she propose to maintain competition in that market without immediately closing a large numbers of local post offices, or does she intend to subsidise local post offices in a privatised or competitive market to ensure effective competition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was given on factual grounds. There is a post office at practically every halt on the road, there is certainly one in every parish. I have insisted, as did the previous Government, on maintaining those local post offices. In circumstances where a postmistress or postmaster retires and a suitable person does not comes forward to run the post office &ndash; as happened recently despite three advertisements for the position &ndash; nothing can be done to prevent the closure of such a post office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question is interesting. There appears to be universal support inside and outside the House for maintaining the network of post offices, and post offices in large urban areas <Col N="804" /> are viable. We cannot, however, have that aspiration and demand that local post offices operate within the post office budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We did not get it in Europe. Neither has there been a draft directive nor has COREPER entered into any discussions because it will not come into force until 2003. Clearly the universal service obligation will have to be applicable because people cannot take the best routes and leave the unprofitable routes to others. On the whole question of postal services, some of which I hope will be encompassed in the talks with the banks, there is a need for the Government to look at putting flesh on its aspiration to keep the rural network open. In that regard some hard decisions will have to made by Government which I hope, will be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying she cannot square the two aspects &ndash; keeping rural post offices open and the postal service operating on a competitive commercial basis? The local post offices cannot operate in that area and will be forced to close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Many of them have sufficient business to be viable. Some, not through their own fault but, because of their geographic location do not have the business at their fingertips to be utilised. Therefore, it is my belief that in a short period the Government of the day, whether this Government or the next, will need to look at the position fully and say that is the aspiration, that is what we want to see around rural Ireland &ndash; and it is contained in the rural White Paper &ndash; and put its money where its mouth is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is refusing to admit what I am saying. While I am Minister and while this Government is in office &ndash; if the Deputy's party was in office it would be the same &ndash;  it stands over the rural post office network. It has been said by all Governments but it is coming to the point that within a period of 12 months or even shorter, where either this Government or the next will have to say its aspiration is the rural network. Given that competition is coming, the question is how can we square the continuation of the rural network of post offices when because of their geographic location business is not available to them? How do we continue to maintain the rural post office network and give flesh to that aspiration? In that regard it is up to me to start to lay the groundwork before 2003 when full competition will be in force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reply. She must recognise that all citizens in Ireland, no matter where they live, must be treated equally. We cannot all live in Ballsbridge. The post office in Ballsbridge, Ballydehob, south west Cork or in Crookhaven is important to the person concerned. If the Minister is to put her words into practice she must give a guarantee that every citizen will be cherished equally and that irrespective of how remote, the posts offices should be subsidised and kept open. The same applies to Garda stations.</P>

I am disappointed she cannot make more commitments in relation to what the task force has reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister make the actuarial costing available to Members and indicate whether she intends to make a capital allocation to the pen<Col N="808" /> sion fund to make up the deficit? On what basis will the Minister seek to make up the deficit? Is she committed to ensuring that pensioners will receive increases in line with proper developments rather than the pensions being tied to indexation, which is far below the level of pensions in other similar employments? What is the Minister's intention? These companies are due to be privatised and the pensioners who created the wealth from which the Exchequer and country will benefit are being left high and dry. With inflation increasing they are in serious difficulty.</P>

Does the Minister agree that the scheme under which the retired aviation staff are suffering is extraordinary in so far as it is dependent on the whim of the trustees, the consumer price index may affect it and if the scheme is not in surplus the staff do not get anything? All other staff to whom they were linked during their working lives, such as staff in the ESB, An Post, Eircom, Bord Fáilte and the Irish Aviation Authority, have pension schemes which are related to increases in staff salary.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>I met with Peter Cassells and other officials of ICTU and SIPTU earlier this year as part of an ongoing series of meetings with ICTU and with the representatives of various trade unions that I and officials of my Department have held prior to and since implementation of the ground handling directive.</P>
      <P>In order to address trade union concerns that there might be a gap in safety regulation as regards ground handling activities, I asked my Department to meet with the relevant regulatory agencies, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Health and Safety Authority, to explore whether additional steps might be required in this area. The opinion of those organisations, as expressed at that meeting, is that there is no failure of monitoring and enforcing of either civil aviation standards or of health and safety standards in respect of ground handling services. The regulatory authorities also expressed the view that there is no requirement for additional regulations in respect of those activities at this time.</P>
      <P>The aviation regulator will not have a role in relation to the safety aspects of ground handling &ndash; his will be purely an economic regulatory role. My Department will, however, continue to keep in close contact with the IAA and the HSA regarding the adequacy of ground handling safety regulation. I continue to monitor letters I receive from Deputies, Senators and members of the public because they often mention issues which later emerge and to which I pay attention. I cannot pinpoint what the fears are but it is clear they exist. If I could isolate the fears, I might be able to address them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her frank reply. When she meets with Peter Cassells will she ensure that she elicits what the fears are because they are very real. Given that the directive is primarily about opening up competition within the marketplace, does she share the fear held by union representatives that&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the safety of the workers, the public and other aviation workers will be compromised in that the financial hallmark which will drive the change will mean, for example, lower training standards and that for this reason monitoring of training is very important? Does she believe the Irish Aviation Authority should be involved rather than leaving it to the aviation regulator so that safety and monitoring are given the highest priority and do not play second fiddle to the opening up of the marketplace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The IAA, together with the HSA, will remain the regulatory body dealing with ground handling. This will not be the remit of the airport regulator which is an economic one. <Col N="812" /> It will remain the remit of the IAA and the HSA. I do not believe that competition in the ground handling area will lead to a diminution of standards. However, I am aware there remains a residue of worry and concern about safety standards within the ground handling area. After the Dáil goes into recess, I hope to have a follow-up meeting with Peter Cassells and others before consulting with the IAA and the HSA. I want to narrow down the concerns and pinpoint how they can be addressed within the present regulatory regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be asking our delegation to refer to my recent statement that the timeframe announced by BNFL recently for the phased closure of magnox nuclear power stations was too little and too late.</P>
      <P>The Copenhagen meeting will, of course, discuss Irish and Danish proposals to end nuclear reprocessing. The UK authorities take the view that management of magnox spent nuclear fuel requires the continuation of magnox reprocessing in the short term. We, on the other hand, believe that non-reprocessing options are feasible for such spent fuel. We also favour the earliest possible closure of the magnox reactors. The magnox reactors are the oldest of the commercial installations in the UK, some of which date back to 1956, and have exceeded their original design life by over 20 years. The Irish Government, and indeed this House, wants to see the magnox reactors shut down and decommissioned.</P>
      <P>UK Ministers argue that the magnox reactors can continue to operate safely. They have pointed out to me in the past that the reactors are subject to regular safety reviews by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate before they are permitted to continue in operation. Nevertheless, I favour the earliest possible closure of these reactors and I will continue to convey this view to the UK Government. Such views will be reflected in the Irish delegation's participation at the OSPAR Commission meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it can be dealt with at another time. Is the Minister of State satisfied that the British proposal to close the magnox <Col N="813" /> reactors, which are well past their sell by date, by 2010 is stretching them to the absolute limit? Will he agree that the magnox reactors represent one of the greatest dangers, together with the dangers identified by the Government, to the Irish people in that they are now obsolete, with old technology, and are liable to accident? Will he also agree, in the context of the Copenhagen conference, that it would be desirable if the Irish and Danish cases, which are quite similar, could be unified? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Stagg's sentiments in relation to our timeframe, particularly earlier when I wanted to elaborate further on the House of Commons committee. Perhaps there will be an opportunity to deal with the matter either privately or otherwise so that colleagues will be aware of the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg laboured with the magnox issue before I came on the scene. I agree it is one of the greater hazards which is always on my short list of important items to discuss with UK Ministers when I meet with them. It has been the subject of many meetings and a plethora of correspondence with Ministers Michael Meacher and John Battle. It is antiquated technology which is way past its recognised sell by date.</P>
      <P>On the amalgamation of the two proposals before the OSPAR meeting next week, there is very little between the two proposals. I have been exhorted to support the Danish proposal. I would be happy to come away from that meeting with the Danish proposal ensured. Nevertheless, I am reluctant at this point to withdraw Ireland's more potent proposal. Discussions will be ongoing right up to when the meeting starts and through the meetings and we will be negotiating with our colleagues on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of ministerial attendance at the meeting. The Minister of State will recall from his files that when I held his position and wished to attend a public inquiry in Cumbria concerning the underground nuclear dump, my officials were adamant that I could not attend the meeting. When I insisted on going they said I could not speak and, when I insisted on speaking, they thought there would be a huge international incident. Will the Minister of State reconsider the advice he has received concerning attending the conference himself? Given the importance of the conference for Ireland, there will be a general view taken that we should be represented at ministerial level. Is the Minister of State of the opinion that that may have the effect of spurring other countries to deal with this issue at ministerial level? There is a real advantage for Ireland in having the Minister present. We won in Cumbria.</P>

However, I suggest that he is not comparing like with like. <Col N="814" /> Neither officials nor anyone else is instructing me on this matter because I must make the decision. There was a meeting of OSPAR in Dublin last year when I met delegates from all the contracting parties. I greeted, addressed and exhorted the delegates to continue with their specific work and left them to their deliberations. I expect Minister Auken, the host Minister on this occasion, will do likewise. During the ministerial segment of the meeting, I discussed the matter with Minister Auken. I wanted to discuss the matter with other Ministers across Europe but a decision had been reached. I regret that but I do not want to impose the Irish view on others.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that if there is a delay on a decision on the second interconnector, the Government will find that John McGoldrick and Enterprise Oil will be able to dictate what happens? Under the liberalisation process in the Bill before the House, he will be able to tell them where the pipelines will go and to decide who gets gas. We would be in their hands. Does the Minister of State agree that if the second interconnector is in place, even if it is surplus to requirements, it will be filled eventually, either exporting or importing gas? Will he consider taking an early decision to allow Bord Gáis Éireann go ahead with the second interconnector, for which funding has been arranged and which was recommended in the study conducted by Bord Gáis Éireann? </P>

BGE has presented a proposal to me for this interconnector and it is being considered in the context of security of supply and competition in close consultation with the Attorney General and <Col N="815" /> advisers. I am being prudent in handling this. The Government wants to ensure that the cost to the end consumer is as low as possible. When certainty about the commercial development of Corrib is established, astute and timely decisions will be taken to ensure security of supply. That will be before the end of the year.</P>

Enterprise Oil made various statements about when it would be done and, according to the first statement it issued, it should have been long ago. It has been postponed again and again. Does the Minister agree that if Enterprise Oil is the main supplier, it will place the Government over a barrel? The company is not making the necessary application to ensure commerciality. What is the cause of the delay and when will the Government receive the application for commerciality?</P>

      <P>I have repeatedly requested a meeting with the board of Enterprise Oil and when I met it some months ago, I asked it not to keep me waiting on this issue. I asked it to come up with a final decision on commerciality. Everyone expects it to be declared, although that has not been done formally for reasons best known to Enterprise Oil. In the meantime we have not been idle, we are working on all the other aspects of the mix and I compliment Enterprise Ireland and the others for their actions in the latter quarter of this year. Decisions will be taken one way or another, regardless of the decision of Enterprise Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the court ruling reported in a Spanish newspaper (details supplied) on 20 May 2000 which recognises that the electromagnetic fields of a transformer can be harmful to health resulting in compensation being paid by an electricity company (details supplied) to a family from Murcia, Spain; and the implications such a policy ruling will have for Government policy here where electromagnetic radiation is concerned.</Quest>

      <P>I will supply the Minister with a translation of the court proceedings. This is the first example of electromagnetic pollution in a citizen's home being recognised and acted on by a court. Will the Minister consider the implications the case has for legislation in this area? Other countries, such as Australia, lay lines carry<Col N="816" /> ing high voltages along underground utility corridors. Will the Minister examine such an idea to avoid problems which, although already in existence, will become worse in future, given that our energy demands are increasing at 6% per year? </P>

      <P>We have some information about the court case. A family which lived close to a transformer station was awarded compensation of $3,200. The electricity company was also ordered to reduce the magnetic field. We do not have sufficient details about the units of measurement and the exposure levels to comment further but I will procure that information and write to the Deputy about it.</P>
      <P>Transformer stations are indispensable components of the electricity generation structure. In Ireland they are designed to comply with guidelines issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Production. The magnetic fields generated by substations are much weaker than the levels contained in the guidelines.</P>

The reply stated that there was no conclusive scientific or medical evidence to prove any connection between electromagnetic fields associated with power lines and ill health.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to mainline and suburban rail customers for the disruption to services caused by this unofficial and unnecessary industrial dispute. I am deeply disappointed that the House must, yet again, discuss these matters. This is all the more regrettable since we have recently seen very welcome progress in the two bus companies, where drivers have accepted change packages by significant majorities. I am keeping in close contact with the company in relation to this dispute. I met the CIE chairman and the Iarnród Éireann chief executive last Thursday and was briefed by them.</P>
      <P>During the past three years Iarnród Éireann has negotiated a restructuring package for locomotive drivers with its two officially recognised trade unions, SIPTU and the NBRU. Separate negotiations with DART drivers are not yet concluded. The package, which is called &ldquo;A New Deal for Locomotive Drivers&rdquo;, was accepted at ballot by both unions. New rosters arising from it were implemented with effect from Sunday 18 June. SIPTU and NBRU locomotive drivers are operating the new rosters, but other locomotive drivers are not.</P>
      <P>The new agreement brings significant benefits for locomotive drivers. It provides a guaranteed five day working week for drivers, bringing to an end six and seven day working. Drivers will now work five days out of seven. The agreement also provides for a significant reduction in the average hours at work per week. The new maximum average will be 48 hours, whereas in the past many drivers worked in excess of 60 hours. It introduces a new composite earnings package covering all overtime, Sunday and public holiday work and all allowances related to duty. This will replace a low basic pay of £14,500, plus the various add-ons, with a stable guaranteed income of up to £29,500. Pay for pension purposes will increase from £14,500 to more than £20,000. The agreement also provides for 96 rest days each year, 90 of which are guaranteed to fall on days when drivers are rostered. Some non-pay elements of the package will be phased in over a 15 month transition period while additional drivers are being trained. The package has also been safety validated by independent consultants, Halcrow Rail, on the company's behalf and the arrangements will be monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's position is that it has negotiated an agreement with the recognised trade unions representing drivers and is now proceeding to implement that agreement. The company is not prepared to negotiate with the Irish Locomotive Drivers Association and considers that to do so would be unlawful, having regard to a recent <Col N="820" /> High Court decision. Such negotiation would also be contrary to the orderly conduct of industrial relations. As Iarnród Éireann is not prepared to negotiate with the ILDA for the reasons outlined, there is no prospect of intervention by the State's industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>I call on the locomotive drivers to immediately begin to co-operate with the introduction of the new rostering arrangements. It is unacceptable that rail users should be deprived of services by this unofficial and unnecessary action. I also urge the drivers to look again at the benefits which the new deal brings and ask them to consider the damage their action is causing to the image of the railway as an effective means of public transport at a time when the rail lines are being developed.</P>
    <P>S.I. 146/2000 is a code of practice which provides guidance to employers, employees and their representatives. Iarnród Éireann has made it quite clear that it will deal only with recognised trade unions and not with unofficial groupings such as the ILDA. In adopting this stance, the company can point to a recent High Court decision which stated:</P>
    <P>The ILDA, not having a negotiating licence and not being an accepted body within the meaning of section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1942 is not a representative union within the meaning of section 55 of the railways Act and cannot lawfully conduct negotiations for the fixing of rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service of locomotive drivers in the employment of Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>The High Court decision has been appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. This is, in effect, an inter-union dispute and I would like to know the legal position in regard to S.I. 146/2000. I realise there is a difference between what we might like to be the legal position and the actual position and I also appreciate that neither CIE nor anyone else wants the negotiating position further fragmented. However, there is a case to be answered in regard to whether individual grievances can be addressed. If they cannot, there would not appear to be a way forward without the introduction of a third party. Can an independent third party be introduced to resolve this dispute? We cannot sit on our hands on this matter with CIE feeling it cannot talk and the industrial relations machinery being unwilling to do so.</P>

Iarnród Éireann has concluded its negotiations with SIPTU and the NBRU which balloted their members and agreed to the proposals advanced. Those proposals confer much greater benefits on the union members.</P>
      <P>The legal position is that because of the High Court ruling on a matter referred to the court by the ILDA, S.I. 146/2000 is not relevant. The statutory instrument envisages collective bargaining and I understand the ILDA is seeking to use the statutory instrument to enter into collective bargaining when the High Court has ruled that it does not have that right.</P>

Working and pay conditions have improved, with wages quite rightly having doubled. I agree it is not in anyone's interest to fragment an existing arrangement.

Will she clarify the content of S.I. 146/2000, section 4, paragraph (4) of which refers to a &ldquo;registered trade union&rdquo;. The ILDA maintains that it is registered as a friendly society. Could it be possible that a mistake was made in the statutory instrument in the use of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;? Does the Minister agree this has given rise to the confusion which exists, with the ILDA stating publicly that it has the right to negotiate with the company? The timing of the publication of the statutory instrument, which was published on 26 May, only a few days before the judgment issued by the High Court on 1 June, was extraordinary.

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister agree it is appalling and untenable that Iarnród Éireann refuses to enter into dialogue with the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association when it represents 132 of the 280 drivers, which is 47%? If that figure were taken with the drivers from the other two unions which rejected the proposals of Iarnród Éireann, it represents a clear majority of drivers who are opposed to the deal being forced down the throats of the locomotive drivers.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is an extremely responsible job to drive approximately 800 people at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour? The lives and limbs of up to 1,000 people are in one's sole care? In that context, does the Minister agree it is folly and irresponsible for an employer to flatly ignore the majority of people who do that responsible job and refuse to even enter into dialogue with them? Does she further agree it is incredible that until September 2001 drivers will be required to work up to ten and half hours per day for seven consecutive days, driving distances of up to 420 miles per day? Is the Minister concerned about safety? Will she listen to the people who drive these locomotives and who will have to carry the responsibility should these long hours take their toll and cause an accident which could have devastating consequences?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Labour Relations Commission invited the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association to talks but then said the invitation was an administrative error? Is it not clear from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's directive, S.I. No. 146 of 2000, that ILDA is a registered trade union and Iarnród Éireann is obliged to negotiate with its members?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is Stalinist for an employers' organisation to ruthlessly reject the concerns of drivers who do such a responsible job, to refuse even to speak with them and direct that they accept provisions with safety implications about which they have serious reservations which are supported by independent authority?</P>

This new agree<Col N="824" /> ment, for which there has been union approval, provides a guaranteed five day working week for drivers, not seven days. This brings to an end six and seven day working. Long before I was a Member of this House, locomotive drivers sought a five out of seven day working week. The agreement guarantees a five day working week for drivers. They will now work five days out of seven.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides for a significant reduction in the average hours of work, reducing it from 60 to 48. It introduces a composite earnings package covering all overtime, Sunday and public holiday work. This will replace a low basic pay of £14,500 with a stable guaranteed income of up to £29,500. It also increases drivers' pension entitlements. Iarnród Éireann had an independent safety study done which found that improved driver morale would greatly improve safety.</P>
      <P>Any seven day service must involve Sunday working, but locomotive drivers will work a five, not a seven, day week. The incidence of Sunday working varies from one depot to another. Before the new agreement, it averaged one Sunday in three and under the new agreement it will range from one Sunday in three to one Sunday in four.</P>
      <P>The truth must be told and that is the truth of the matter. I ask ILDA to look again at the arrangements which have been worked out and at the new roster, within which there is a significant improvement for locomotive drivers. The disruption being caused to the public is not warranted and is unacceptable. I ask members of ILDA to join their fellow workers in SIPTU and NBRU in accepting the new roster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I had requested the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss this matter but it is more appropriately dealt with by way of a Private Notice Question and I thank you, Sir, for allowing it.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the level of public awareness of the temporary arrangements obtaining in the course of this dispute? It was stated this morning on a national radio station that only western and southern lines were affected but, travelling on a northern line, I was left waiting for an hour and a quarter with many fellow passengers. Will the Minister liaise with the management of Iarnród Éireann to ensure, notwithstanding the dispute regarding the status of ILDA, the public is not left wondering about arrangements? If the Minister is serious about encouraging people to switch to public transport the public must not be given wrong information, as is happening during this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Minister make a Freudian slip when she said this dispute occurred at a time when we are developing the railway lines? Much of the origin of this dispute lies in the general low morale in public transport and its underfunding. Does the Minister agree there is a shortage of park and ride facilities, rolling stock and late night services and a lack of reliability in our public transport <Col N="825" /> system? These matters must be at the root of the Minister's response.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree that ILDA is reporting for work but not to work the new roster because of lack of park and ride facilities. That is the kernel of the point made by the Deputy and I do not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it was a Freudian slip because we are investing considerable amounts of money in the railway lines. I take the Deputy's point that people should know what services are running. Numbers are quoted constantly, both in adverts and in interviews on RTE. I take the Deputy's point about the line on which he travels, the Dundalk-Drogheda line to Pearse Station, that 70% of services were expected to operate today. The situation is altering by the minute because some lines are running fully, others are running at 50% but none of them are below 50%. That is still unacceptable when there are timetables which state at what times the trains should run.</P>
      <P>I will undertake to tell the management of Iarnród Éireann that they should make all the changes in the timetable very plain by adverts, notifications and microphone announcements. It is a great injustice to the travelling public that this situation prevails in June of this year. I again ask the drivers in ILDA to look afresh at the proposals which have been put to them and to agree to work the new roster.</P>

Did she hear Tim Hastings on the radio this morning suggest that the safety issues being identified by the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association might be taken up by the other unions and perhaps the Minister could facilitate that to try to find a solution to this without breaking the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I heard Tim Hastings who was on the radio at lunch time and, as always, he had comments of great interest to make. The transport forum is set up under partnership and concerns the greater Dublin area but mostly concerns matters laid down for the future. The Deputy asked me, if I could, without breaking the law, encourage the other unions to review the safety aspects as identified by ILDA. That would be a matter for the trade unions. However, we must be clear about this. There are recognised trade unions. There is labour relations machinery for dealing with such matters set up by the State and in the main, it functions very well.</P>
      <P>We might all, from time to time, make various comments, but in the main, people have a right to strike if they are in a recognised trade union. They have a right to have their grievances heard and that is happening. I return to the main point that the High Court has ruled this is not a trade union for negotiating purposes.</P>

As a result of what I have heard today, will the Minister ask her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to make an unequivocal clarification about S.I. 146/2000, which seems to be the reason why ILDA is gaining credence in its argument that it is entitled to be negotiated with? If this statutory instrument does not give them that right, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment needs to say that unequivocally and if she has used the wrong word in it, she needs to change the statutory instrument.</P>

Does the Minister agree that the High Court has not prohibited Iarnród Éireann from discussing or having a dialogue with the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association? It has not prohibited this. Therefore, according to the Tánaiste's statutory instrument, it is obliged to do so because it is a registered trade union, which has been clarified.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Public Enterprise aware of reports that the Labour Relations Commission was subjected to pressure, after issuing an invitation to the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association to meet it, to withdraw the invitation? Does the Minister agree that the independent study carried out at the behest of the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association must carry much weight, that the person mainly responsible has much experience in Britain, in particular, where there have been some major rail disasters and does she accept that the study which Iarnród Éireann has now produced in response is only out for a matter of days and still needs to be analysed?</P>

      <P>On No. 49, I am sure every Member was absolutely appalled by the recent horrific tragedy involving a container at Dover in which 58 asylum seekers died. Will the Tánaiste explain why it has taken from March to June to take Report Stage of this legislation in the House? Why has it taken the Government so long to bring the Bill to the House, given that it was published almost a year ago? Such a tragedy was waiting to happen and is likely to happen to asylum seekers being transported to Ireland. The Government will be found wanting because it has taken a year to process this legislation and to get the message across to transport carriers about the dangers in which they put people in by transporting them in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was cross-party support for the original measure published more than a year ago to deal with the issue of trafficking in illegal immigrants, trafficking in human beings. The <Col N="830" /> Government sought to graft on to this legislation substantial amendments to other legislation and has thereby delayed it for a year. The original legislation to deal with trafficking is not on the Statute Book and other controversial legislation has been introduced at a late stage. On Report Stage, substantial new measures were grafted on to this Bill. I will not agree to the guillotining of this portion of the Bill. It was a bad approach from the beginning. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have allowed the original trafficking Bill to be enacted and should have introduced a proper immigration Bill to deal with the other matters.</P>
      <P>Given that we had some debate belatedly on this important issue, will the Tánaiste allow the main Opposition spokespersons and the Minister sufficient time to deal with this legislation as expeditiously as we can and not require a guillotine of two hours for the remaining important amendments to be addressed by the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some effort was made by the Opposition to assist the Government in the passage of this legislation through the House so that it would be implemented. The blame lies with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for grafting on more amendments, as Deputy Howlin said. If he had processed the Bill as drafted it would be in place now and we would at least be sure that decent sanctions were in place if people behaved in a way similar to that which caused the recent tragedy. Deputy Howlin's question is valid if some debate is still to be had. We want the legislation passed as quickly as possible so that people who illegally transport human beings in such conditions can be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the issue. It is important that this legislation is enacted as quickly as possible. We need tough and decisive legislation in this area. Trafficking in people is an affront to everybody's dignity. I share the views expressed by Deputies Owen and Howlin in regard to the tragedy at Dover. Committee Stage of this legislation was debated for a long time and it is a matter for the Whips to decide the order in which business is taken in the House. However, as the Deputies will be aware, we have eight Bills to deal with before the end of next week. I believe that two hours this evening should be adequate. This legislation, which will make trafficking illegal, brings in hefty unlimited fines, provides for the forfeiture of vehicles and prison sentences of up to ten years. It is timely and urgent and we should not delay it.</P>

The issue to be addressed is the curtailment of the rights of access to the courts for asylum seekers.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach promised action on inflation. However, the Government appears to be at odds regarding what it intends to do about the level of inflation. Will the Tánaiste indicate if the Government intends to introduce measures in the House to deal with rising inflation? The Government has talked in a general way about price orders on drink, etc. What exactly is the Government doing about inflation? Does it intend to introduce measures in the House because little time remains before the summer recess?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the greatest guarantee that consumers get the best value at reduced prices and with better choice. The Government is concerned about the rise in inflation, but the issue is manageable. We will not be panicked into doing something that might damage the economy. Competition remains the key ingredient. However, in areas where the competitive market is not working&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the words &ldquo;open mind&rdquo; mean that the Government does not know what to do? Can the Tánaiste tell the House what exactly the <Col N="835" /> Government has done with regard to competition? Up to one week ago, the Competition Authority did not even have staff to deal with competition inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Have Irish intelligence sources confirmed the threat to the UFF ceasefire which was signalled today? Has the Government been in touch with the UDP and asked it to exert whatever pressure it can on the UFF to ensure that the ceasefire is maintained in the interests of the continuance of the peace process? Have there been any discussions today with any of the other parties to the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the British Government, about dealing with this serious threat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is not present but the Minister for Defence is here and perhaps we can revert to the Deputy. I do not know if any contacts were made between the Irish authorities and other authorities today. However, I will ensure that those responsible contact the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Tánaiste shares the widespread concern in this House that such an action would be a serious blow to the peace process, would it be appropriate for both Governments to have a bilateral approach to the UDP to underscore the seriousness any breach of or resiling from the ceasefire would have on the peace process? The Opposition parties should be briefed as a matter of urgency on the measures to be taken to exert whatever pressures are required before midnight tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed in the House. Has the Tánaiste had an opportunity to talk to the Taoiseach about this matter? I know he is away on Government business but he <Col N="836" /> is in the presence of Mr. Blair. Have they been briefed by their respective heads of police forces about this threat and, if so, what action will the two Governments take? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not spoken to the Taoiseach because he is in Portugal, but he will be back later this evening. I am certain he has been briefed. Any action the Governments can take on this matter will be taken. It might not always be wise to make public statements on this issue. I assure Deputies that Opposition parties will be briefed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of twelve months beginning on the 30th day of June, 2000.</P>
      <P>The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuation in operation of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which would cease to be in operation on 30 June 2000 unless they are continued for a further period.</P>
      <P>Section 18 of the Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, provides that sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2000 unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will appreciate that although this legislation has been in force for a relatively short period, the Act itself, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, recognised the importance of revisiting the provisions at an early date. The intention was to afford Members of the House an opportunity to examine and debate the issues involved which go to the very core of our duty to protect fundamental rights and our responsibility as Members of this House to protect the security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bomb, was to provide the additional protections and powers needed to tackle the threat to the security of the State and the integrity of the peace process presented by certain malevolent dissident groups, by making amendments to the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1972. Principally these amendments made changes in the rules of evidence in relation to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and, more generally, other offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences. The Act also created new substantive offences and extended <Col N="843" /> the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the 1939 Act. It might be useful if I set out in some detail those legislative provisions &ndash; provisions the Government wishes to see continued.</P>
    <P>The provisions of sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 of the Act can be divided into four categories with four essential purposes. First, the Act made changes to the rules of evidence that previously applied to both the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and, more generally, for the purpose of other offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences under those Acts. Second, the Act created certain new substantive offences of particular relevance to the activities of unlawful organisations and those who provide support for them. Third, the Act gave additional power to the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf; and, fourth, the Act extended the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.</P>
    <P>The first category of sections under discussion, sections 2 to 5 of the Act, concern changes in rules of evidence. Section 2 has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and is one of the key provisions of the Act. Its effect is to provide that where, in any proceedings against a person in relation to that charge, evidence is given that the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence while being questioned in relation to that offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. The section goes on to provide that references to any question material to the investigation of the offence include any references to any questions requesting the accused to give a full account of his or her movements, actions, activities or associations during any specified period. The section also provides that any such inference may be treated as, or as capable of, amounting to corroboration of any other evidence relating to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. The section contains two important safeguards: it provides that the section does not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure or a false or misleading answer might be, and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from a failure to answer a question or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which amended section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, made a related and consequential change. The effect of the former section 3 of the 1972 Act, which provided that any statement or conduct by an accused implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, when pro<Col N="844" /> ceeded against for membership, be evidence that he or she was then such a member, was also to define the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 was to align the definition of conduct with the expression used in section 2 of the Bill, that is, &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; was defined to include movements, actions, activities or associations in addition to the failure to deny such a report.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act, which made the second important change in the area of evidence, also has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. It provided that in proceedings for such an offence the accused shall not, without leave of the court, call any other person to give evidence on his or her behalf unless notice has been given of his or her intention to do so. The procedures to be followed in this are set out in subsections (2) to (7), inclusive, of the section, which are closely modelled on the existing provisions of our criminal law on the requirement to give notice of an alibi on which an accused intends to rely for the purpose of his or her trial. The section also provides that the requirement on giving notice will not apply to a witness whose evidence is solely on the matter of sentence.</P>
    <P>The third change in the area of evidence was made by section 5. This section is not restricted to the offence of membership but, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more, has application to any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, scheduled offences for the purpose of the 1939 Act and offences arising out of the same set of facts as an offence under the Acts or a scheduled offence. The effect of this section, which is closely based on a similar provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section, as with section 2, incorporated important safeguards whereby it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to mention such a fact might be, and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>The second category of provision created five new substantive offences. These were provided for in sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and section 12 and include directing an unlawful organisation; possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences; unlawful collection of information; withholding information and training persons in the making or use of firearms, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939. That <Col N="845" /> offence attracts a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable opinion that the article is in his or her possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. The section also provided that it will be a defence to prove that the materials were not in the person's possession for such purposes. The offence attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information, which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. A serious offence is defined for the purpose of the section as an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more involving loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss or damage, and includes an act or omission done or made outside the State which would be such an offence if done within the State. The section also provides that it will be a defence to prove that the information in question was not being collected and so on for the purpose of being used in the commission of a serious offence. The offence of unlawful collection of information attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána. A serious offence has the same meaning as it has in section 8. This offence attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. This offence attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>As I indicated during discussions in the Oireachtas leading to enactment of this Act, these offences have limited application, they are of a type that are likely to be committed by members of unlawful organisations arising from the activities of such groups. They are, therefore, targeted at specific activities, such as the collection of information which would be of assistance in planning terrorist attacks or the possession of material which can be used in making improvised explosive devices in which members or supporters of such groups can, and do, engage. Likewise, the offence of directing an unlawful organisation calls for evidence over and above that of membership of such an organisation. It was, nevertheless, considered prudent to provide for such an offence <Col N="846" /> which is capable of attracting the higher penalty of life imprisonment, to deal with circumstances where such evidence may exist. The offence of withholding information has a wider potential application, but the message it is intended to underscore is that it is the duty of persons who have knowledge of planned offences involving death, serious injury or destruction, or information which would lead to the conviction of those responsible for such offences, to make that information available to the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. That will mean persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act and can be charged in relation to such offences on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 is the third category of provision and is intended to strengthen the powers of the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf. This section amended section 61 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which deals with the forfeiture of property used for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence or intended to be used <Col N="847" /> for that purpose in circumstances where a person has been convicted of an offence. The effect of the change made by section 17 is to provide that, in the case of persons convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, a court will be required to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order. The provisions of section 61 apply to real and personal property and, therefore, permit the seizure of lands on which arms are stored should such a course be warranted.</P>
    <P>The fourth essential purpose of the Act is to extend the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act  &ndash; which was 48 hours &ndash; in two separate circumstances. First, section 10 will allow a District Court judge to authorise the detention of a person for a further period not exceeding 24 hours, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, provided the District Court judge is satisfied that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his behalf. Second, section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person, in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained but released without charge, for a further period which again is not to exceed 24 hours, in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that last Thursday, in accordance with the requirements of section 18(3) of the Act, I laid a report before this House on the operation of these sections during the period 3 September 1998 to 29 May 2000. That report contains information received from the Garda authorities and it shows that during the period covered by the report, no court proceedings utilising sections 2 to 9, inclusive, or section 12 of the Act have yet arisen. However, the Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the Garda during the investigation of offences. Members of the House will appreciate that many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the number of occasions on which a period of detention was extended under section 10 was 29 and that each of those detentions was in respect of a single person. I am further informed that no persons in respect of whom extension orders were made have yet been charged or convicted of an offence, but a number <Col N="848" /> of files have been submitted to the law officers for directions. Nobody has been re-arrested under section 11 of the Act, and no orders have yet been made utilising section 17 of the Act, although I understand it is possible the section will be invoked in relation to cases before the courts at present.</P>
    <P>In considering these statistics, it is important to bear in mind that the provisions of the Act, which were acknowledged on all sides of the House to be strong, were intended to be used only in limited circumstances. It is not surprising, therefore, that the power of extended detention has been used in a relatively small number of cases, and that the trial related provisions have not yet been applied. This sparing use of the provisions of the Act does not indicate that they are no longer needed, but rather simply reflects the intention that exceptional measures should not be used routinely. The view of the Garda authorities, as outlined in the report I laid before the House, and in light of their current security threat assessment, is that these provisions should remain in force. I concur fully with that view.</P>
    <P>In addition to immediate security concerns, which alone would justify the continuance in force of these provisions, there is another compelling reason for such a continuance in force. Deputies may recall that in 1998, on foot of a commitment made in the Good Friday Agreement, I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, to conduct a wide-ranging review of the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998. The review is currently under way and I expect that the committee will report towards the end of this year.</P>
    <P>It clearly would make no sense to ask such a committee, under a distinguished chairman, to review the Offences against the State Acts, including the provisions we are discussing today, and then to allow the provisions to lapse before the committee reported its conclusions on these very provisions.</P>
    <P>In light of the Garda assessment of the current threat to security that exists, notwithstanding the progress being made in implementing the peace process, and in order to allow enough time for the completion of the report by the committee that is reviewing the Offences against the State Acts, I ask the House to continue in force the relevant provisions for a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>I commend the resolution to the House and thank the House for obliging me by allowing me to finish my statement.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I have no problem with the Resolution before the House which is in accordance with section 18 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. One is immediately forced to ask why the perpetrators of the Omagh atrocity are still at large. Why is it that the additional powers, willingly given by this House and the Seanad on 2 September 1998, have not been effective in bringing a single charge <Col N="849" /> against anybody involved in the planning or execution of the Omagh bomb? Why is it that in spite of the extra powers given to the Garda and the courts the people responsible for Omagh are living out their lives at liberty in this State while the relatives of the 28 people killed continue to mourn the murdered members of their families and those mutilated and injured continue to suffer and bear the scars of the outrage? Why is it that the Real IRA still continue to ply its evil wares?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform agree with the assessment of the Garda Commissioner that the likelihood is that those responsible for Omagh will never be caught? The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was the response to Omagh. In his presentation of the Bill to the House the Minister said in the Official Report, 2 September 1998, at vol. 494, col. 32:</P>
      <P>Both the so-called Real IRA and the Continuity IRA must be left in no doubt about the consequences of any further vacillation on their part: they will continue to meet a determined response from the Government and the security forces and they will not be allowed to thwart the will of the people.</P>
      <P>The reality is that they have continued to thwart the will of the people as expressed through this legislation. They are still in existence. They are still active and the members of the Real IRA, responsible for Omagh, are still at large.</P>
      <P>The acid test of any legislation is its effectiveness and its degree of use. In his closing reply will the Minister tell the House why no court proceedings have been brought to date under sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 12 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998? Why is it that no convictions have been obtained let alone charges brought? For example, the Bill created five new offences, directing an unlawful organisation, possession of article for purposes connected with certain offences, unlawful collection of information, withholding of information and training of persons in the use of firearms. Despite all the good intentions nobody has been charged let alone convicted of any or all of these offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Omagh bomb and before the 1998 legislation was introduced a senior Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform source was quoted in the newspapers as saying, &ldquo;The intelligence and evidence against these people is already there but there is no way convictions would have been secured under existing legislation&rdquo;. The same source is further quoted as saying, &ldquo;There is enough actual evidence against those responsible for this heinous crime to make strong cases against them under this new legislation&rdquo;. The clear message, and we welcomed it at the time, was to entice this House and the Seanad to embrace the new legislation. The message was, &ldquo;We know who those responsible are, we know where they are, we know how many <Col N="850" /> there are and we must act quickly, therefore, give us the legislative tools and we will ensure that those responsible for Omagh are put behind bars&rdquo;. To date there nobody has been put behind bars.</P>
    <P>If we know who they are, how many there are and where they are, why are they not behind bars? I recall that Deputy Flanagan during the debate on the 1998 Act put on the record the fact that the man who made the Omagh bomb was described in the media as a 32 year old unemployed electrician living in a well-known suburb of this city. Does the Garda believe this is the man responsible? If so, has he been arrested and questioned under this Act? Deputy Flanagan also referred to the fact that the security forces in Northern Ireland were prepared to provide the Garda authorities with detailed forensic reports on the Omagh bombing. Will the Minister indicate the level of co-operation there has been between the Garda and the RUC in the follow-up to this atrocity? For example, has there been an exchange of forensic data? Who exactly is in charge of the Garda investigation into the Omagh bombing? Has the investigation been scaled down in light of the Garda Commissioner's reported comments?</P>
    <P>Legislation is only effective if it is applied effectively. We have seen in the past that legislation that was well-intentioned has not been applied effectively. For example, section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, requires a person to give information in his possession as to how the person came into the possession of firearms and ammunition. Section 16 of the same Act creates an offence of withholding information about stolen property. Section 18 allows for inferences to be drawn from a person's refusal to account for the presence of his person or any mark or substance. Section 19 similarly allows for inferences to be drawn from a person's presence at a particular place where a crime is committed and where such a person fails or refuses to account for such presence. Legislation is only effective if it is applied effectively. The number of times that these particular sections of the 1984 Act have been applied is limited. Section 52 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, which provides that a person detained in custody is advised to give an account of his movements, has largely fallen into disuse.</P>
    <P>Despite the tough talk and all the aspirations for this legislation in the wake of Omagh the legislation has not delivered the goods. It has failed to deliver up the Omagh murderers. There is no room for complacency, as evidenced by the explosive device found at Hillsborough this morning. The ongoing sporadic attacks by republican paramilitaries should disabuse us of any notion of complacency. The ongoing paramilitary beatings and punishment shootings and the threat of an end to the ceasefire by loyalist paramilitaries are ominous reminders that the peace process is a fragile instrument.</P>
    <P>One notes the contents of the Garda Síochána <Col N="851" /> corporate strategy, particularly the acknowledgment that dissident republican terrorists remain a threat to the State with the &ldquo;strong capability to attack chosen targets&rdquo;. We should never forget that. The Garda obviously believes that so long as those responsible for Omagh are still at large there is every possibility they will strike again and they must be brought to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was introduced in September 1998 in the aftermath of the horrific Omagh bomb that left so many dead, maimed and wounded and horribly scarred physically and mentally. The town of Omagh was devastated. The Omagh bomb, the worst single incident in more than 30 years of violence, was a particular shock given that it came with a few months of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its subsequent endorsement in referenda by an overwhelming majority of people, North and South, on this island.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bomb was an act of indescribable evil. It was recognised at the time as not just designed to bring death and injury and destruction to the people of Omagh, but it was also a calculated attempt to destroy the entire peace process in Northern Ireland. The initial shock at the horrific carnage gave way to a sense of determination that those responsible should not be allowed to usurp the clearly expressed wish, hope and expectation of the Irish people for peace and for new political structures on this island that would make political violence, permanently, a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that this House voted overwhelmingly to approve the Bill the Government brought forward, despite the strong reservations of many Members about the severe nature of many of its provisions. The Labour Party recognised the need for a strong and unequivocal response from the Oireachtas to the Omagh outrage and the need to demonstrate clearly that those responsible would be tracked down and not allowed to get away with that despicable act of mass murder. We also agreed to it because we were led to believe the law then operating would not be adequate to bring those responsible to justice and that new and further powers were required. Newspaper reports at the time quoted a senior Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform spokesperson as saying, &ldquo;.the intelligence and evidence against these people is already there.but there is no way convictions would have been secured under existing legislation.there is enough evidence against those responsible for this heinous crime to make strong cases against them under the new legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas delivered the new powers sought by the Minister, the Government and the Garda Síochána, but they have failed to deliver the prosecutions and convictions we were given to believe would follow. As far as I am aware, <Col N="852" /> only one prosecution has been taken arising from the Omagh investigation. It is still before the courts. Nobody has been charged with murder. Nobody has been charged with direct involvement in the bombing. The longer the time that passes, the less likely it is that anyone will be charged. The Garda Commissioner, Pat Byrne, admitted in an interview in March this year that it was now unlikely that those directly responsible would ever be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>At the time the Bill was introduced, I called on the Minister to give an unequivocal commitment that the investigation into the Omagh bombing would continue until those responsible were brought to justice and that, if necessary, the Government should issue a directive to An Garda Síochána in that regard. The comments of the Garda Commissioner shocked the families of the dead. While they might have reflected a professional assessment of the situation, they gave the wrong message not only to those who were bereaved and wounded but also with regard to the absolute determination of the offices of the State to ensure that, regardless of how long it took and what resources were required, there would be a determined effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. I hope the Minister will reaffirm that however long it takes and whatever resources are required, those responsible will be held accountable and face justice.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that no convictions have been secured following the enactment of the legislation. What is even more surprising is that there has not been a single prosecution or conviction secured under this legislation which, we were told in September 1998, was so badly needed. There has not been a single prosecution under any of the sections, although the Minister told me in reply to a series of parliamentary questions last week that a number of files had been referred to the law officers. The only section of the Act which appears to have been used is the power to extend the existing period of detention of people in custody. A total of 29 people have had their period of detention extended but none of them was subsequently charged or convicted.</P>
    <P>In my parliamentary questions last week I asked the Minister the number of proceedings where inferences were drawn as a result of a failure of an accused person to answer questions material to an investigation of an offence in respect of section 2 of the Act; the number of proceedings taken under section 4; the number of proceedings where inferences were drawn as a result of a failure of an accused person to mention particular facts in respect of section 5; the number of proceedings taken under section 6 relating to directing an unlawful organisation and the number of prosecutions secured; the number of proceedings taken under section 7 relating to possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences and the number of convictions secured; the number of proceedings taken under section 8 relating to unlawful collection of information and the number of convictions secured; <Col N="853" /> the number of proceedings taken under section 9 relating to the withholding of information and the number of convictions secured; the number of occasions on which a period of detention was extended under section 10; the number of persons in respect of whom extension orders were made and the number of persons in respect of whom extension orders resulted in a charge or conviction. In respect of section 11, I asked the number of occasions on which persons were re-arrested and in respect of section 12, I asked the number of proceedings taken relating to the training of persons in the making or use of firearms and explosives. Finally, I asked, in relation to section 17, the number of occasions on which property had been forfeited and the value of the property forfeited.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that these sections were vital and urgently needed to deal with the outrage of a new vicious and illegal organisation determined to undermine the peace process and to attack the State. The answer I received was that no proceedings were taken utilising sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 12 of the Act. The Minister must account for that. The failure to use the powers provided by the Oireachtas raises legitimate questions as to whether these powers were needed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will not on this occasion oppose the motion to extend the operation of this Act for a further 12 months. It is aware there is still a threat to the peace process and to the State. We support the motion primarily because the review of the principal Act, the 1939 Offences Against the State Act, being undertaken by a committee chaired by the former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Anthony Hederman, has not yet reported, but is expected to do so before the end of the year. However, I wish to put down a marker on behalf of the Labour Party. Its view today should not be taken as an indication that we believe this measure should become a permanent feature of the law.</P>
    <P>The original Offences Against the State Act was introduced in 1939 to deal with the upsurge of IRA activity at that time and the outbreak of the Second World War. Sixty years later it is still on the Statute Book. A declaration of emergency was passed by the Oireachtas as a result of the Second World War&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Chair will allow me a couple of minutes to conclude. The declaration of emergency remained in effect, if not in use, until the rainbow Government moved a motion to <Col N="854" /> have it lifted in 1995. The Special Criminal Court was re-introduced in 1972 and is still in use.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the earliest possible publication of the Hederman report. It is surely now time to consider whether it is appropriate that an Act with such provisions as the Offences Against the State Act should be part of our permanent Statute Book. Clearly there are still threats to this State. We have looked for reform within the institutions of the British state and the Administration in Northern Ireland. We must apply that same rigour and scrutiny to our own affairs and I hope in the weeks and months to come we will be visiting the Offences Against the State Act and the other emergency provisions as peace is restored in this country.</P>
      <P>It is now time for a fundamental review of all these provisions and I hope the Hederman report presented to this House will provide the opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Howlin's concluding sentiments. The House should remind itself that for many years, while there was no obvious or overt threat to the security of the State, the legislation which was passed in 1939 remained in force. There was no threat, for example, from the end of the Second World War until the late sixties, apart from one brief interlude of a couple of years in the mid to late fifties. However, the legislation remained in force as it had to and as it should, because every State must have legislation of this kind to guard its security and the security of its institutions and citizens. I do not think we should be apologetic about that because I know more about the need for it than many people in this House.</P>
      <P>I reread this morning what I said in this House on 2 September 1998 when this Act was introduced. Given the passage of almost two years I have no reason to disagree with what I then said, that is, that if I found any fault with the 1998 Act it was that its provisions were temporary rather than permanent and that they would expire on 30 June 2000 unless renewed by resolution of this House. At that time when the Act was passed it was envisaged that the renewal could be for a period of five, ten or 15 years if this House saw fit. Since then &ndash; I only became aware of this fact when reading the various Acts this morning &ndash; the Criminal Justice Act was passed in 1999 which had the effect of limiting the renewal of the 1998 Offences Against the State Act to a 12 month period. It does not limit it to one 12 month period only, but it means that if we are to continue in force these provisions, this House and the Seanad will have to pass resolutions of this kind every 12 months. This is a pity for the reasons I stated in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go through the offences created by the 1998 Act. Section 6 relates to the offence of directing an unlawful organisation. That is now a serious offence. Why should it not be an offence if this House decided in a year's time not to renew it? If directing an unlawful organisation is <Col N="855" /> now a serious matter and a serious breach of the criminal law, it should always be that. Section 7 provides an offence for the possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences. That relates to things such as fertiliser and detonators for the manufacture of bombs. If that is now an offence, and it is very properly one, why should there be the possibility that in a year's time it would not be an offence? It should always be part of our law. Section 8 relates to the unlawful collection of information for the purpose of murdering people or kidnapping. That is now an offence. Why should it become not an offence and a lawful activity in 12 months' time in the absence of a resolution of this House? These should all be permanent parts of our legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 creates the offence of withholding information. This was directed particularly at farmers who find the IRA/Sinn Féin coming in to manufacture bombs on their property or holding firing sessions to train young men how to aim and fire guns in order to kill people. It was declared an offence to withhold information regarding that kind of activity from the Garda. Why should it not be an offence in 12 months' time and why should it not be part of our permanent law? Section 10 extended the period of detention under section 30 if one got a warrant from a district justice. What is wrong with that? Why should that not be permanently the position? Section 11 allowed a district justice to issue a warrant for the rearrest of someone under section 30 if new evidence came to light. Why should he not issue such a warrant? Section 12 created the offence of training persons in the making or the use of firearms. Why should it in 12 months' time, in the absence of a resolution from this House, become lawful to train people in the making or use of firearms? Why should that not be a permanent offence in the law of this country?</P>
    <P>Section 17 allows for forfeiture of property used for these subversive and terrorist purposes. Why should it not be open to a court to forfeit such property? In 12 months' time, this will not be the case if this House does not renew this order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin was wrong when he said the 1939 Act was introduced after the outbreak of the Second World War to take account of the circumstances and threat to national security that then arose. The Offences Against the State Bill, 1939, was introduced in 1938, was passed through both Houses and signed by the President on 14 June 1939. This was approximately three months before the outbreak of the Second World War. It was envisaged by the Oireachtas at that time, and rightly so, that legislation of this kind should be permanently on the Statute Book of any country which is intent on protecting itself and its citizens.</P>
    <P>I notice from the speeches made in 1998 that people thought there was no threat to anyone in this country from any subversive or terrorist organisation, except from what was then called the Real IRA. We have since had the birth of the <Col N="856" /> Continuity IRA and various other organisations. I am not satisfied that the organisation which began life as the Provisional IRA no longer constitutes a threat to this country. Like the Garda, I think we would be very foolish if we were to lower our guard in this respect and not retain the necessary powers to deal with subversion and terrorism of the kind we have seen, particularly over the last 30 years and intermittently. I fully support this motion. I regret, however, that it is only a 12 month motion and that we cannot permanently enact these provisions, all of which seem reasonable. They should be part of our permanent law.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's report on the Act and it is not an impressive document. It is very flimsy and does not indicate that a great deal has happened. I fear that we may be living in a time of appeasement in which we are expected to be politically correct. People are regarded as politically correct only if they are prepared to appease terrorism and threats to the State or the population on any part of this island. I am not prepared to appease it. There is a different atmosphere in this debate from the debate which took place after the Omagh bombing two years ago. I wish people still had the same anxiety they expressed in the immediate aftermath of Omagh and that greater use had been made of the provisions in these Acts.</P>
    <P>That there have not been any successful prosecutions does not mean that the provisions in the Act were not useful in terms of investigation. The number of prosecutions, however, is very disappointing. It is hard to understand why, with the powers granted by the 1998 Act, it was not possible to mount successful prosecutions, particularly against those who held themselves out publicly as major figures in these terrorist organisations and who did not deny consistent media reports to that effect. That is one of the provisions in the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>I support the motion but I regret that it will be necessary for the House to pass another motion of this kind in 12 months time. If there is to be a review of the 1939, 1940, 1972 and 1998 Acts, they should be consolidated and any amendments necessary to bring them up to date made. All the provisions should then become and remain permanent. Any amendments made should not be by way of appeasement of terrorism but should reflect the advance in the situation since 1939.</P>

      <P>I strongly refute the claims made by Deputies who link the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act to the peace process. The peace process will not be protected by repressive legislation. Only political address and progress will lead to the necessary anchorage of the current absence of armed actions, an anchorage that my colleagues in Sinn Féin and I strive to achieve daily. Our task as politicians and legislators is to make politics work and to have the courage to repeal all repressive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the decision of the Government to <Col N="857" /> renew the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. I opposed the Bill at the time of its introduction and I will continue to do so. This legislation has added significantly to the body of draconian legislation enacted since 1939. It represents a serious infringement of civil rights in this State.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Bill was enacted in the heat of justified anger &ndash; anger which I shared &ndash; at the Omagh bombing in which 29 people died. It was presented at the time as essential to combat those responsible for the bombing. The impression was given &ndash; as it was with previous such Bills &ndash; that these were essentially emergency measures designed to deal with an immediate threat and without long-term consequences for the ordinary rights of citizens. The Act, however, placed on the Statute Book strong new powers for the Garda and the State and all experience shows that once such powers are given it is very difficult to withdraw them.</P>
    <P>Section 2 attacks the right to silence and reinforces the provision for the conviction of a person for membership of an unlawful organisation on the basis of the opinion of a senior garda. The Minister is asking us today to renew the provision whereby the exercise of the right to silence can be used to corroborate the word of a garda. The exercise of the right to silence can mean that the court is empowered to draw inferences from failure to mention any fact later relied on by the defence. In effect the right to silence is removed.</P>
    <P>This is perhaps the most draconian aspect of the Act. The Minister has signalled that he intends to further restrict the right to silence in the wider legal code. No doubt this Act will be the model for such new restrictions and once again we will have the widening of repressive legislation. Laws which were originally presented as an emergency response to politically motivated organisations are to be applied across the board.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage of the Bill in 1998, I described Section 4 as one of the most drastic measures ever brought before the Dáil. It represents, in effect, guilt by association. A person's &ldquo;association&rdquo; with another or others can be used as evidence of membership of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to renew the extension of the period of detention allowed under Section 30, to 72 hours. This power has been widely abused by the Garda and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Act created the nebulous offence of &ldquo;directing at any level&rdquo; the activities of an unlawful organisation with life imprisonment as the penalty. It created the offence of possessing &ldquo;any article&rdquo; which would give rise to &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; that the article is to be used for offences under the various Acts to do with explosives. These two provisions are clearly modelled on British legislation and are equally unacceptable, designed as they are to secure convictions on the flimsiest of evidence, or on no real evidence at all.</P>
    <P>The British Government is due to introduce a new so-called &ldquo;terrorism Bill&rdquo; later this year, a <Col N="858" /> Bill which will retain the powers of the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act and add new ones. The decision by the Irish Government to renew this Act is therefore doubly damaging. It attacks civil rights in this State and it gives the British Government a perfect example to point to when it resists demands for the repeal of its own repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is asking us to renew an Act which runs contrary to the Good Friday Agreement, a key element of which is the commitment to human rights. I oppose this renewal and I call, as I did in 1998, for those parties which deem themselves the Opposition to do likewise.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was rushed through the Dáil in one day in the wake of the Omagh atrocity and there was no opportunity to hold a proper public debate on it. I strongly opposed the Act's introduction in 1998 and I am opposed to the renewal of certain sections of it today.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bombing was an appalling atrocity. It was in the same league as the most notorious atrocities carried out on various occasions during the past 30 years by the British Army and republican and loyalist paramilitaries. Since 1998, there has not been an atrocity similar to that carried out at Omagh. Why is that the case? Is it due to the introduction in 1998 of this extremely oppressive legislation? The answer clearly is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It was the mass revulsion at and rejection of the brutal methods of the paramilitary organisations by the majority of people on this island which forced the members of the gang who carried out this atrocity to return to the hole from which they came and discouraged them from repeating their crime.</P>
      <P>The mass opposition of the majority of ordinary people on this island has stayed the hands of other groups which might have contemplated the carrying out of atrocities similar to that which occurred at Omagh. These groups are answerable to no one and they do not speak for any significant proportion of the Irish people. It is the desire of the majority of people on this island that no actions of a paramilitary nature should be carried out in their name. That is what made the decisive difference in the aftermath of Omagh.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was a cynical ploy by the Government which was designed to give the impression that it was taking significant measures to stop such atrocities and to capture those responsible for them. However, the facts indicate that this gesture was futile. No one from either the North or South has been prosecuted for or convicted of carrying out the bombing in Omagh, despite the fact that similar legislation was introduced in both Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act plays fast and loose with the fundamental civil rights of the Irish people. The Dáil legislates for approximately 4 million people, not for a few dozen isolated individuals who would <Col N="859" /> carry out an atrocity such as that which occurred at Omagh. The legislation applies to all the people on the island and it can be used against the innocent. The sections we are renewing overturn many crucial aspects of Irish law, they criminalise innocent and lawful activities and place the onus on people to prove that they are not criminals. The activities to which I refer include hunting or having in one's possession information which might be deemed to be of use to a paramilitary organisation. The onus will be placed on people accused of being involved in such activities to prove their innocence. A similar situation obtains in respect of the right to silence.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley justified the introduction of the various Offences against the State Acts from 1939 to date. He pretended that the legislation under discussion is only to be used against a small violent group of people. The Offences against the State Acts are wide-ranging in nature and can be used not only against people engaged in violent activities, such as paramilitaries, but also against people engaged in peaceful civil disobedience or mass action against a Government or its decisions. For example, it is possible that any organisation which promotes, encourages or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the central fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of local taxation shall be an unlawful organisation within the meaning and for the purposes of section 18 of the 1939 Act. Under the legislation a campaign to oppose the introduction of water or refuse collection charges which people consider unjust and unfair can be rendered illegal and suppressed.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, are more wide-ranging than we are being led to believe and I oppose their renewal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members who spoke on this resolution to renew the relevant provisions of the Offences against the State Act, 1998, particularly those who spoke in favour of it. In bringing forward the resolution I am acting on the advice of the Garda authorities that the threat which gave rise to the need for these provisions in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing remains, despite the progress we have made in the peace progress. I am also conscious of not taking any <Col N="860" /> action which would pre-empt the report of the committee chaired by former Justice Mr. Anthony Hederman, which is conducting a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the State Acts in general.</P>
      <P>The sparing application by the Garda of the provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act provides assurance that measures meant for exceptional cases have not been improperly used. That is not to say, however, that they will not feature in cases yet to be brought before the courts. Nor is it my intention to underplay the need to have in place exceptional powers in anticipation of specific needs which may arise for their use.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the possibility of people being convicted for the Omagh bombing. A thorough investigation of this matter, involving co-operation between the Garda and the RUC, is ongoing. Legislation on its own cannot uncover the necessary evidence needed to charge people. Everyone is aware that the evidence required must be put before a court, which must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual concerned is guilty. It was never claimed that legislation enacted after a particular offence would produce evidence which could be used against persons in respect of that offence. When the Act was passed it was stated that it was necessary to deal with the threat posed by subversive groups. However, the legislation has been used in investigating particular offences.</P>
      <P>Deputies also referred to comments made by the Garda Commissioner in relation to bringing to justice those responsible for the Omagh atrocity. Following the commissioner's remarks, it was clarified that the Garda authorities were determined to do everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for the horrors of Omagh. The Garda Commissioner never indicated otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to quantify the effect of this legislation as a preventative measure. However, I suggest that, as such a measure, the probability is high that it has been extremely successful. The legislation was meant to deal with people intent on subverting the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people. When it was introduced, the Taoiseach correctly described it as draconian. However, the Garda authorities and I believe that it is necessary that the legislation should remain in force.</P>
      <P>It must also be stated that the investigation of the Omagh bombing is ongoing. There is no question of the file being closed; this matter is being vigorously and actively pursued. I am of the view that, ultimately, this legislation will be of considerable benefit in the context of the threat posed by subversive elements in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 35 to 38, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;be&rdquo; in line 35, down to and including &ldquo;and,&rdquo; in line 38.</P>
      <P>We are still dealing with what is probably the most controversial section of the Bill, namely the new judicial review regime which will apply to this category of cases. Amendments Nos. 15 and 17 seek to amend section 5(2), particularly subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for leave to apply for judicial review under the Order in respect of any of the matters referred to in <i>subsection 1</i> shall be made by motion on notice (grounded in the manner specified in the Order in respect of an <i>ex parte </i>motion for leave) to the Minister and any other person specified for that purpose by order of the High Court, and, such leave shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision, determination, <Col N="862" /> recommendation, refusal or order is invalid or ought to be quashed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 seeks to delete all the words from &ldquo;be&rdquo; in line 35 to &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 38, inclusive. Normal judicial review is applied for <i>ex parte.</i> There is no reason a stricter rule should apply to judicial review of asylum cases, yet the Minister's requirement is that the normal <i>ex parte </i>rule would not apply and that leave would be required on notice. At present the notice requirement is confined to planning matters. The Minister argued the need for notice because of his need to prepare an answer. However, the State gets sufficient notice before any effective order is made. This amendment merely proposes that the need to give notice to the Minister before permission is granted to launch the case be deleted. Why is it necessary, in this confined area of the operation of the law, for judicial review to require notice to be given to the Minister? The answer clearly is that it is not necessary.</P>
    <P>We have recently seen a very effective application for judicial review to quash an Executive decision of Government. Applications for judicial review come, as a matter of routine, before the courts every Monday. Normally they are briefly dealt with. A statement of the case is made by counsel seeking leave to apply for judicial review and a determination is made as to whether there are sufficient grounds for the court to hear an argued case.</P>
    <P>The Minister is creating a corpus of law which deals exclusively with asylum seekers and is designed to be extemely narrow and confining. There is no reason for it and I ask the Minister to accept that there is no compelling reason notice should be given. If there is such a reason we have not heard it. In a previous debate the Minister referred to &ldquo;selective presentation by the applicant lawyers of the facts&rdquo;. This is a serious slur on lawyers who practise in this area. The applicant is obliged to present all the relevant facts to the court.</P>
    <P>Judicial review should be of general application and not subject to varying rules depending on the nature of the decision being reviewed. It is a statutory safeguard and an overview by the courts of the actions of the Executive or of anyone who is allowed to make Executive decisions. It is intended to ensure that procedures are correct and fair. Its principle of application is general. The Minister should not apply different criteria to applications for judicial review in the area of asylum.</P>
    <P>This subsection underscores the Minister's attitude, which has been clear from the beginning, that asylum matters are so unique and so different from the general application of law and Executive decisions that an entirely different set of procedures should apply. This is why people are so concerned by the new regime which is envisaged in these legislative measures.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business today we spoke of the need to enact this legislation. I support what was said then. Legislation to deal with trafficking <Col N="863" /> and with human misery must be enacted. However, the grafting on of these restrictive measures regarding the rule of law and the overview by the courts of Executive decisions and quasi-judicial decisions by the Minister or his officers is unnecessary. Judicial review is a fundamental safeguard which should have universal application.</P>
    <P>The Minister must either justify the need for a set of rules which apply exclusively to asylum seekers and no others &ndash; they apply in the planning area but to no other rights issues &ndash; or, if the Minister is convinced that the procedures for judicial review in general need to be overhauled, he should make a general case. He must decide whether judicial review procedures require a general overhaul or put a cogent case as to why asylum seekers must have their rights with regard to judicial review uniquely curtailed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 seeks to delete the words &ldquo;are substantial grounds&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;is an arguable case&rdquo;. In entertaining an application for judicial review the court must be satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision, determination, recommendation, refusal or order is invalid or ought to be quashed. Normal judicial review is based on an arguable case. Only planning law requires substantial grounds.</P>
    <P>The argument I made for amendment No. 15 applies with equal measure of validity to amendment No. 17. We should keep the normal rules of law. We should not invent new and specific rules for the asylum area uniquely. The Minister may quibble with my use of the word unique. The rules will apply only to asylum and planning matters. Planning matters relate to development, asylum issues relate to human and fundamental rights. On Committee Stage, the Minister failed to give any acceptable, intelligent or cogent reason a different set of procedures should apply to judicial review in the area of asylum seekers from any other area of law, other than planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister must either say the general application of judicial review procedures is faulty and he wishes to amend it or there is an overwhelming, cogent, clear and arguable reason the area of asylum seekers should have a virtually unique procedure for applying for judicial review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>noting that Ireland's rapid rate of economic development is resulting in increased pressures on the environment, and noting in particular</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> that the rapidly rising numbers of vehicles in our towns and cities are causing serious traffic congestion, noise pollution and air pollution;</P>
    <P>that we have already exceeded our greenhouse gas emissions target for the 2008-2012 period;</P>
    <P>that our natural resources are being wastefully exploited; and</P>
    <P>that child care, accommodation and travel costs are unsustainable in large urban areas,</P>
    <P>therefore calls on the Government to implement a concerted and comprehensive programme of public and private sector decentralisation and regional development incorporating</P>
    <P>targeted investment in water and sanitary service infrastructure for key towns to facilitate large-scale housing and commercial property development;</P>
    <P>the accelerated roll out of broadband high capacity telecommunications services to facilitate e-commerce business development;</P>
    <P>the relocation of Government Departments and agencies wholly or in part to towns requiring economic regeneration; and</P>
    <P>the extension of tax or other appropriate incentives for service industries to facilitate new jobs and relocation to selected provincial towns, in light of the high congestion and social and other costs associated with the current centralisation of such jobs in metropolitan centres.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ring, Olivia Mitchell, Deenihan, Neville and D'Arcy. I move the motion in the name of my colleague, Deputy Dukes and my Fine Gael colleagues in the parliamentary party.</P>
    <P>This motion is very timely and worthy of the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government because it highlights the effect our rapid rate of economic development is having on our environment. The quality of the environment and its reflection on the quality of life for us all is strongly linked to economic progress and development. We are now in a period of unprecedented growth, development and economic opportunity but the signs that our environment is under pressure are evident all around us.</P>
    <P>The recently published report by the EPA focuses on some of those pressure points. Coming on the brink of a new millennium, the report is a timely reminder of the legacy of the past effects on the environment and what the future may bring if we do not pay attention to the environment and to the damage we are inflicting on it daily.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development is a term about which we currently hear much. A national sustainable development strategy was published in 1997 by <Col N="865" /> the Government. Its aims are to ensure the economy and society can develop to their full potential within a well-protected environment, without compromising the quality of that environment and with responsibility towards present and future generations and the wider international community. It is a worthwhile and commendable objective which defines the balance required between the environment and our development. That was published in 1997. In 2000, we can quote many examples of a deteriorating environment.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact of many of our economic, recreational and leisure activities has not been assessed and only last week in this House, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government refused to accommodate an amendment from Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the Planning and Development Bill. The amendment proposed to include the term &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; in the Title of the Bill as a measure of how firmly we believe in this principle. We called a division of the Dáil on that principle because we firmly believe that the term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; should be included in such an important Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are not prepared to enshrine sustainable development in our legislation, we cannot possibly expect that the principle will be carried through all levels of the administration of the State. We are paying lip service to that principle and allowing development and economic success to drive ahead at a cost to the natural environment.</P>
    <P>The 1996 census showed that our population has risen to 3.6 million with almost 60% of the population now living in urban areas. This is increasing as more and more people move from rural areas into towns and cities. We have now become a world leader in a number of aspects of economic performance. In the period 1988-98 Ireland was the fastest growing OECD economy with an average growth rate of 7%.</P>
    <P>Economic activities use two primary factors, labour and nature. Nature and the natural environment is used in terms of raw materials, energy, water, air and its capacity to assimilate or absorb the residual or waste material. We have become over reliant on this capacity. Nature and our natural resources are starting to show the signs of pressure.</P>
    <P>The EPA report to which I referred highlights a range of issues which arise in relation to the current state of the environment in Ireland. It singles out a number of these which merit special attention. These include the urban environment and transport, climate change, greenhouse gases, protection of our natural resources, eutrophication of our inland waterways and waste and litter. With 60% of our population living in urban areas, the quality of the urban environment is a major concern for most people living in this State. This applies to Dublin particularly with one third of the national population living there.</P>
    <P>Increasing urbanisation is creating the need for the movement of a large number of people and <Col N="866" /> goods within our cities and towns. This must be accommodated by good public transport. However, it is not happening. We do not have good and reliable public transport as we have seen today and yesterday with the disruption in our railways. The lack of properly designed road services and systems to facilitate and provide these facilities is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the quality of our urban environment. The concentration of large numbers of people in confined areas without the necessary supporting infrastructure required creates problems such as air pollution, traffic jams and traffic noise, all attributable to the number of cars, buses etc. that are required. These problems and conditions induce stress and can impact directly on the health of our nation and on those living in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Many parts of our cities and towns contain streets which date from a much earlier age and are unsuited to carry large numbers of vehicles. All of these problems are destined to increase with the rapid rate of urbanisation which is seen currently.</P>
    <P>The number of new car registrations rose again in the first period of this year by 50% on last year. This figure will increase again as more new cars come onto our roads. The development of large suburbs distant from places of work is contributing to the stress felt by people. A headline in one of today's newspapers highlights this stating that Dublin's suburbs are sprawling beyond the limits of London and Los Angeles. Bad planning has allowed Dublin suburban sprawl to spread as far as 50 miles outside Dublin. For many people, this probably means a commute of an hour and a half to two hours. An extra three to four hours in their working day adds pressure in terms of transport, child care and parking. The number of cars on the roads and the emissions from the road traffic have now become the greatest threat to air quality, especially in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The main pollutants of concern are nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, PM 10s and PM 5s, and benzene. There is very limited monitoring of these. We give them very little attention yet they can be very harmful to human health, most notably creating problems in the functioning of our respiratory systems.</P>
    <P>We do not have enough monitoring of these emissions. The limited figures we have indicate that there are major challenges ahead to meet the limits for these emissions. Over the past 15 years, we have fallen far short of reducing the most important air pollutant emissions as required by international agreements and it seems as though we are heading that way again with the Kyoto Agreement requirements. Having failed to stabilise nitrogen oxide emissions at 1987 levels by the year 1994 as required under the Sofia Protocol, it now appears that Ireland will not achieve the national target for sulphur dioxide emissions in 2000 required by the Oslo Protocol.</P>
    <P>Greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels, methane, most <Col N="867" /> probably from agriculture, and nitrogen dioxide have increased in the period 1990 to 1998 by approximately 19%. This has serious implications for our commitment under the Kyoto Agreement by which we are committed to reducing our greenhouse gases by 13% over 1990 levels. We signed the Kyoto Agreement when we had already overshot our target. With a current growth rate of approximately 4% annually in these gas emissions, mainly due to carbon dioxide increases based on the most recent forecast for energy and agriculture, the net emission of greenhouse gases in 2010 will have increased by 30% over the 1990 levels. That is more than twice the growth limitation target imposed by the Kyoto Agreement and agreed by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Radical changes in policy are needed to reverse this trend and to make a substantial impact on the upward trend in these gas emissions if we are serious about sustainable development and about our international commitments. Ireland has ignored the Kyoto principles, to which it agreed. It is on target to increase emissions levels by 4% per annum and by 2010 it will have doubled the agreed levels.</P>
    <P>Water quality continues to deteriorate. A trend of increasingly slight to moderate pollution of our river system since the 1970s has not been reversed and continues to worsen. Eutrophication is a classic example of the impact of economic development on the environment. It can be attributed to excess phosphorous from economic, domestic, industrial and agricultural activity, which has the greatest impact. Salmon and trout levels in our inland waterways have been adversely affected. The quantity of waste generated is increasing and has been the subject of many debates in the House. It is another measure of economic activity and the pressure it puts on the environment.</P>
    <P>The intent of the motion is to challenge the Government to focus on the state of the environment and the effect that increased and rapid urbanisation is having on it and to channel resources accordingly. It also aims to encourage the Government to examine decentralisation in terms of relocating Government Departments outside Dublin into major growth centres and to develop them. It is also intended to highlight the stress people are under and the cost of living in large urban areas associated with increased expenditure on child care and transport. For example, vacancies in nursing are increasing because people cannot afford to live in the Dublin area. Many sectors offer a Dublin loading to try to attract people. However, decentralisation needs to be focused on to encourage people to live in smaller urban areas rather than large urban areas. This policy can only be followed if the Government is serious and is committed in this regard.</P>
    <P>By 2011 the population will exceed 4 million and over the next decade 45,000 or more dwellings per year will be needed. This will necessitate <Col N="868" /> an unprecedented level of house building which underlines the need for careful land use planning integrated with environmental protection. The protection of our environment is essential for this and future generations. Projected growth levels in transport, energy and forestry are highly significant and sustainable development in these sectors must be challenged and met.</P>
    <P>The link between economic growth and environmental damage needs to be broken. I referred to the EPA report &ldquo;Ireland: Environment&rdquo; which demonstrates that when one examines any of the factors leading to pressure on the environment and the deteriorating effect on it it is linked to economic growth. The motion was tabled in the hope that the Government will focus on our economic growth and the pressures it creates for the environment and will reverse that trend rather than going down a long road on which it will be difficult to turn back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The state of the environment is a big issue. The biggest issue in Dublin city and the surrounding area is that the city is over developing. I come from County Mayo and do not mind speaking about the county because the people there elected me to this House. The chief executive of the IDA, Mr. Doran, presented its annual report earlier and there was no good news for County Mayo again. The year 1999 was a record one in terms of job creation but the Government has failed. The IDA comes out with the same claptrap every year whereby it says it is trying to get people to invest in the west. When industrialists come to Ireland they do not invest in the west because in many places there are not proper water or sewerage schemes or roads and we are still in the Dark Ages. Why would they invest? For example, one would be better off crossing the fields than using the road between Longford and Charlestown. It is the worst road in the west, yet Structural Funds have been invested three or four times in roads leading to the east coast. We in the west cannot bring an ass or cart down some roads. That is why Dublin is bursting at the seams and the west is dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick and tired of the IDA and the Government. However, the Government is about to relocate Departments outside Dublin. The Progressive Democrats do not count any more &ndash; the few members it has left will probably join Fianna Fáil and those who do not will probably join Fine Gael. There will be a straight fight at the next general election between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. I want the west to gets its fair share of decentralisation. We are unlucky in the west. Recently, after three years in power, a Cabinet Minister was appointed who is from Galway, a city that is doing well. I am glad he was appointed, but under this Government it was the first time since the foundation of the State that a Member from the west had not been in the Cabinet and it was the first time in a long time that Mayo was not represented at the Cabinet table. I assure the Minister that will not happen following <Col N="869" /> the next general election. Three able Fine Gael Members will be returned who will sit at the Cabinet table and there will be action for the west.</P>

      <P>Towns such as Ballinrobe, Erris, Kiltimagh, Westport and Ballina would be well able to cater for whichever Government agencies are decentralised, whether it is the Department of the Environment and the Local Government or Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I make a plea to the Minister. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, passed through the House last week. I want the Minister to call in all the county managers and ask them their thinking and policy on rural Ireland. As a public representative I receive most complaints from people living in rural areas who cannot get planning permission because every county manager and planner wants to shove people into towns, thus destroying the towns. They will not grant planning permission to people who have inherited land in rural areas because they have different ideas about how their counties should be developed.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to ask all the county managers their position on planning. Will they grant planning permission in rural areas any more? I am sick and tired of getting stick from people who experience refusal after refusal because a planner who was educated in Belfast has a different concept of planning and development from a colleague educated in Dublin. None of them has the same concept and none of them can outline what their local authorities want in terms of planning. They all have different ideas. The Minister should call them to a meeting, find out the differences and draw a fair distinction in regard to planning.</P>

      <P>I have heard the Minister say that he firmly believes the provision of sewage treatment to rural villages is essential if we want people to live in those areas, and I agree with him in that respect. One of the critical factors in promoting rural development is the provision of sewage treatment because most of the country is now connected to water mains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of my village of Finuge in north Kerry could be doubled in one year if we had sewage treatment facilities. Every day land<Col N="870" /> owners are refusing to sell sites to prospective clients because they would only be permitted to undertake frontal roadside developments and no in-depth development. Consequently, they would be destroying the potential of their land for future development if they gave away their road frontage. The more money that can be included in the Estimates for his Department to enhance sewage treatment facilities, the greater the contribution the Minister will be making to rural Ireland. I will remind the Minister for Finance of that fact at every opportunity in order to strengthen the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's position in Cabinet &ndash; if he needs that &ndash; when he is seeking extra funding. Even if the Minister had to breach spending restraints within the overall financial framework of Government spending, I would be totally supportive of maximising funding in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government has fallen behind in providing an accelerated roll-out of broadband high capacity telecommunications services to facilitate e-commerce business development. When contributing on the debate on the Electronic Commerce Bill, I stated that in the e-commerce area</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that there is a rapid roll-out of the broadband network and that the investment planned in ICT infrastructure under the National Development Plan is prioritised. E-business will remove the issue of geographical locations from trade, but that will only happen when it is possible for every area in Ireland to link in to the broadband network. The Minister needs to assure us that rural Ireland will not be neglected and perhaps the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, could look at the Swedish Government's £6 million Euro plan to ensure that no matter how remote, every part of Sweden will be connected to the broadband system.</P>
    <P>The Electronic Commerce Bill that is going through the Dáil at the moment, is just one step on this road. As I mentioned in my contribution to that earlier debate, rather than Ireland becoming an information superhighway, we are rapidly declining into an information boreen. I am sure the Minister will understand that language. Rapid progress must be made in this sector. From all the newspaper articles I have read and the commentators I have heard, it is obvious that we have fallen behind substantially, even in the past year. The motion addresses this matter and I would like the Minister to refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>The final part of the motion refers to the relocation of Government Departments and agencies, wholly or in part, to towns requiring economic regeneration. Today I accompanied a delegation from Listowel in County Kerry to meet with officials in the Department of Finance regarding decentralisation. I can see the benefits of relocating a Government office to Listowel which has one of the finest cultural and environmental perspectives in the country. The town has no traffic <Col N="871" /> congestion and there are very good educational and service facilities.</P>
    <P>It will be one of the Government's greatest achievements if it can decentralise 10,000 or so public servants to different parts of the country. It is a critical matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague from Mayo might be surprised that as a Dublin Deputy, I am equally enthusiastic about the process of decentralisation. I regard it as a national issue which is as important for the quality of life of the citizens of Dublin as it is to the rest of the country. I fully support a coherent, planned and targeted process of decentralisation, but I want to see it happen for the right reasons. These include achieving more balanced regional development, building sustainable communities, both in rural and urban areas, ensuring that no area grows faster than its ability to sustain that growth, maintaining our natural environment and building cities and towns which offer a good quality of life to all our citizens in a setting which is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. I regard these as valid reasons for decentralisation.</P>
      <P>As a Dublin Deputy, I become nervous when I hear talk of decentralisation because I suspect the motives of some members of the Government may be very different, although this is perhaps not so of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who is present. I suspect the Government has decided to abandon Dublin and start again somewhere else. They have failed to plan for the city's growth by providing housing, transport, child care and a waste management infrastructure &ndash; all of which are required in a capital city.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Deputies of all parties, should reflect on how they would react if &ndash; while representing towns like Waterford, Cork, Galway or, in the Minister's case, Navan &ndash; they were told that because the Government had not provided transport or housing, their sons and daughters would be shunted off to live somewhere else and that jobs and investment would be directed elsewhere. I can guess how they would react; there would be a revolution, and rightly so. There will be a revolution in Dublin if decentralisation, or the cause of balanced regional development, is used as an excuse to effectively abandon the people of Dublin and deny them the infrastructure which can give them the kind of life they deserve. After all, a third of the country's population now lives in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of urbanisation is a world-wide phenomenon and is probably an inexorable process that we cannot fight. However, it can be channelled, managed and targeted. If the Government was serious about managing the urbanisation process it would identify where the growth areas will be and would direct both the infrastructure and resources there. Such a plan would draw people to these areas, instead of forcing them there. It would provide the kind of job choices and opportunities in housing, education, <Col N="872" /> culture and entertainment that would enable such towns not only to hold their own young populations but also to provide a local focus for the surrounding towns, villages and rural hinterland. This cannot be achieved by taking bits of Government Departments and transposing them to a ministerial backyard with absolutely no criteria as to why such decisions are being made.</P>
    <P>We have received the early report on the development of a national spatial plan, but I regret that the final report will not be prepared for another two years. By that time we will be in the third year of the current national development plan. How is it intended to marry the NDP's investment spending with the needs of the new national spatial plan? Much investment will be wasted because it will not be targeted on the areas that we assume will be identified as growth areas.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage, would it be possible for the Minister to bring forward that portion of the national spatial plan which would identify the major growth areas, so that investment spending can be made in a sensible way and targeted on those areas where we intend to settle the main populations in future? We should not make the same mistakes we made in Dublin in the past by failing to provide facilities in advance of population expansion trends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and, in the time available to me, I intend to deal with the reference in the motion to child care. I am surprised there is no mention of child care and its cost in the amendment tabled by the Government. This is indicative of the Government's approach and attention to this issue. It has failed to publish the review of the report prepared by the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care.</P>
      <P>This report, which was published in January last year, was followed by the appointment of a review group which was given six months to set out its practical implications in terms of Government policy. Ten months after the deadline, the Government's silence is deafening. Its foot dragging, squabbling and inertia with regard to decision making have helped to prolong the crisis in child care and the consequent difficulties for people who wish to access it. Thousands of working parents with young children have been left high and dry. Emergency measures are needed to radically tackle the child care crisis.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that nurturing children is the most important role in any society. It is much more important than increasing GDP. Yet, in the current debate about child care, children are discussed as if they were inconveniences that need to be parked while the captains of industry increase their business productivity. Employer organisations should not be driving the debate about child care, but that is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Men and women who have children need to take equal responsibility for child care, but the emphasis must be on equality and responsibility. <Col N="873" /> Working time should be reordered so that higher priority is given to the needs of children. The debate on child care is not taking proper account of this aspect. Ireland is an increasingly stressful place in which to raise children. Every family faces growing pressures. From the moment a child is born, its day and that of its parents is filled with a series of struggles against the increasingly chaotic living conditions that have become the daily norm, as previous speakers noted.</P>
    <P>Children must cope as much as adults with broken footpaths and inadequate public transport services, as demonstrated this week. Children's journeys to school by car aggravate traffic congestion because their parents do not trust public transport. Children play in public parks which are fouled by dogs against whose owners the law is not enforced. Children are afraid to take bicycles onto the roads because of the lack of cycle lanes and poor road maintenance.</P>
    <P>Where both parents of a child must work outside the home &ndash; 42% of mothers of younger children are in employment &ndash; the stress of raising a child begins within weeks of its birth when maternity or paternity leave ends. It is now almost impossible to find quality child care at an affordable price in many areas. The implementation of regulations by health boards has already resulted in the loss of at least 2,000 child care places nationally. In particular, the Fine Gael Party believes that five steps, two local and three national, should be taken to provide care for children.</P>
    <P>First, at local level, local authorities' planning guidelines should facilitate the provision of child care in residential areas. It is wrong for planning authorities to insist that a house in a residential area cannot be used as a small crèche to mind children who live in the immediate locality. The interests of children are best served by being cared for in their immediate neighbourhood. Second, at local level, primary schools should be made available for the franchised provision of child care during after school hours in unused rooms. New high density city housing schemes need to be designed with children and child care in mind. This aspect has been ignored in too many recently built apartment complexes. There is great potential for the better use of existing infrastructure in providing after school care.</P>
    <P>Third, at national level, child benefit for children under the age of five years must be increased to £25 a week. This is a huge commitment but our children deserve it. In addition, it is fair to all children. It guarantees that all children are treated equally, regardless of whether they are in paid child care or being looked after in the home by a parent, grandparent or other relative. Paid child care should not be privileged over unpaid child care or <i>vice versa</i>. The family should have the resources to make a free choice. The Fine Gael Party's child benefit proposal does not distort the choice of parents. It recognises that all families are different. It focuses first on the needs of children and only then on the economic needs <Col N="874" /> of adults. I will outline the rest of this policy at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is most important and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Environmental damage is an important issue at present. The motion is wide ranging and deals with different aspects of the damage caused by environmental pollution. The biggest polluters are local authorities, which are under the control of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Government. However, little is being done to rectify this situation, although it has been brought to the notice of the Minister and the Government on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the issue of car parks. There must be a stated interest in giving a boost to revitalising smaller towns and a stemming of the tendency of people to move to outskirts and surrounding countryside is desirable. However, this may bring its own problems. Recent upward trends in car sales have brought an increasing number of cars onto the roads. Sales so far this year are already 40% higher than in the same period last year. In towns such as Gorey, which is a busy market town, increased traffic has led to parking problems for locals and visitors.</P>
      <P>Much of the new traffic on our roads uses the national road network and Gorey is divided down the middle by the main Dublin to Rosslare road. Despite an effective new traffic control and parking system in the town, problems remain. The emphasis in the town renewal scheme will be on protecting and restoring our built heritage. This will include the refurbishment of existing buildings to include living accommodation and shops. The purpose of the scheme is to reintroduce population to these areas and this obviously will bring further traffic problems.</P>
      <P>In Gorey the main thrust of the scheme will be on regenerating the town's centre area, which is already congested. In this context, it is vital that the economic and commercial life of the town is not strangled. This will only be prevented if adequate car parking facilities are provided. I ask the Minister to make provision in the categories for initiatives involving tax relief for areas that can be designated for car parking, including multi-storey parking facilities. A proper car parking system will also contribute to the other aims of the town renewal scheme, increase the sustainability of places in which to live and work and stem the loss of shopping and other facilities to larger towns where parking is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to the extension of tax or other appropriate incentives for service industries to facilitate new jobs and relocation to selected provincial towns. This is a most important aspect and I ask the Minister to take note of it. The congestion in towns is unbelievable. We have repeatedly raised the issue of car parking. As Members are aware, space is at a premium. In terms of economics, no individual can afford to build a multi-storey car park because the cost per unit is <Col N="875" /> approximately £7,000. This will have to be subsidised by the Government. There is no space for car parks in towns such as Gorey, Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford. This is also a problem in towns in every other constituency.</P>
    <P>Flat car parks are extremely expensive and, therefore, the cost of providing multi-storey car parks must be subsidised. I appeal to the Minister to take this aspect into consideration. Tax incentives are not adequate. He may think they are adequate, but that is not the case. More subsidies are needed to remove bottlenecks and to restore the situation where car parking is available in small towns.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Government's neglect of our railways. The roads are loaded with cars but the railway from Rosslare to Dublin could handle 24 carriages. This would remove 1,000 cars from the roads each morning. The train could travel from Rosslare through Wexford, Enniscorthy, Gorey, Arklow, Wicklow town, Bray and onto Dublin. The failure of the Government to upgrade the railway lines is a disgrace. If the Minister wants to reduce pollution and to take cars off the roads, he should improve the railways. Numerous people commute from my county and from Counties Carlow and Kilkenny. We should fill the rail carriages and take the cars off the roads by providing proper rail services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition party for its support for the Government's policies outlined in the motion. I refer to decentralisation, balanced regional development, infrastructural investment in roads, water, telecommunications and industrial policy. The motion strongly supports action in these areas and, therefore, the Government's action in these areas. I note that, apart from the most tangential reference, it neglects to mention the important area of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> We can and should take pride in the record levels of economic growth and prosperity which have been achieved in recent years. Since the foundation of the State many of our citizens would have welcomed the opportunity to live in a country where employment is readily available and where emigration is a matter of choice and not necessity. It is easy to lose sight of the gains we have made, particularly over the past ten years. At the same time, I accept that economic growth brings its own difficulties and challenges which must be addressed and overcome so that economic and social progress can be maintained and built upon. The Government is fully aware of the infrastructure and environmental pressures created by recent prosperity and has taken steps to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The extent and quality of the country's physical infrastructure is of critical importance to economic competitiveness and the potential for growth. In recent years the combination in Ireland of unparalleled economic growth and demographic changes have created intense new demands in the housing, transport, water and waste water, waste and health sectors. There is also the need to better distribute economic gains around the country through physical and information networks and highways.</P>
    <P>The Government has demonstrated its commitment to resolving these problems by substantially increasing investment in economic and social infrastructure since it took office and prioritising, through the national development plan, investment in infrastructure during the period to 2006. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, planned investment includes £6.3 billion to bring the national and non-national road network up to higher standards of service, £2.2 billion to radically improve public transport services and £3.6 billion to upgrade environmental services, including water and waste water services and waste management. For the first time, the plan covers investment in housing, health and sports and recreational facilities, in addition to the traditional areas of economic and environmental capital expenditure, including £6 billion to meet the social housing needs of over 90,000 households and £2 billion to improve health infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Overall annual investment in economic and social infrastructure will run at £3 billion, an increase of 55% over 1999 levels. Investment in roads and water services will amount to almost three times the 1994-99 levels. This investment in infrastructure will be implemented principally through the Operational Programme for Economic and Social Infrastructure and an operational programme for the Border, midlands and western region and the southern and eastern region. The investment will result in far-reaching improvements in our internal transport networks, in the supply of serviced land and housing, in water and solid waste services and in health facilities.</P>
    <P>As regards national roads, our objective is nothing less than a transformation of the net<Col N="878" /> work. Some £4.4 billion will be invested in upgrading key inter-urban routes to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard while, at the same time, carrying out badly needed major improvements on other national primary and secondary routes. Equally, the investment of £1.6 billion in non-national roads will see the completion of the current non-national roads restoration programme. Almost £3 billion is earmarked for investment in water services to address, in particular, deficiencies in relation to waste water treatment, serviced land and the quality of rural water supplies.</P>
    <P>The £6 billion provided in the national development plan for housing reflects the Government's commitment to tackling social and affordable housing needs. In response to increased social housing needs since the agreement of the national development plan provisions, the Government has introduced a further range of measures to increase social and affordable housing provision. The number of local authority housing starts has been increased over the plan period from 35,500 to 41,500, that is, 1,000 extra in each year from 2001 to 2006. The four year local authority housing multi-annual programme which commenced this year will, accordingly, increase from 22,000 to 25,000 starts.</P>
    <P>Further additional measures have been taken by the Government to ensure enhanced capability in meeting social and affordable housing needs, including the improvement of the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes, improved funding for site acquisition for voluntary housing bodies, initiatives to facilitate better utilisation of the existing housing stock and the facilitation of land acquisition for social and affordable housing by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The £2 billion to be invested in the health service will enable major improvement to be made in the infrastructure and equipping of acute hospitals. In addition, it will make substantial progress in upgrading facilities in the non-acute sector, including facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, the elderly, the mentally ill and for children in need of care and protection. This level of investment in health infrastructure facilities represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. It demonstrates unquestionably that the objective of securing an improvement in the health service has been a priority for the Government and is an important part of the Government's commitment to addressing social inclusion.</P>
    <P>This infrastructural investment will take place in the context of a clear regional dimension to the national development plan, which has as one of its fundamental objectives the continued development of a dynamic competitive economy, but with more balanced regional growth. I cannot overstate the importance attached by the Government to the national spatial strategy. It will provide a long-term framework for economic and social development and planning that will set the <Col N="879" /> agenda for the development of the country over the next 20 years and beyond. The strategy will be about far more than the selection of key towns for large scale housing and commercial property development. It must address a range of issues relating to economic competitiveness, social cohesion, sustainable development, the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage and improving the quality of life for all sections in Irish society and for all areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy will provide a framework for achieving long-term growth on a balanced regional basis by providing the opportunity for each region to achieve its development potential. There will be a major role in this for &ldquo;regional gateways&rdquo; such as the existing major urban areas, as engines for growth, supporting national competitiveness while spreading growth within their zones of influence.</P>
    <P>The national development plan recognises that there will also be a role for a limited number of additional &ldquo;regional gateways&rdquo; whose identification is a key task for the national spatial strategy, based on criteria such as the gateway's ability and attractiveness to promote growth, its location and accessibility and its ability to diffuse growth within its associated sub-region. As part of this process, the strategy will have to address strategic infrastructure needs to facilitate the development of the designated gateways, particularly in relation to the additional centres.</P>
    <P>The strategy will also have to pay particular attention to the future development of Dublin, both in terms of the capital's future role in a Europe-wide context and in terms of the relationship between Dublin and the rest of the country. This will have to include the issue of applying restraints on further urban expansion in the Dublin area and the form this might take.</P>
    <P>The House will be reassured to know that, unlike Fine Gael, the Government has no wish to see all future development concentrated in major urban centres outside Dublin. For this reason, the strategy will also set out a basis for the future development of smaller urban centres through, for example, designation of development clusters with links to major urban centres and rural hinterlands. It will offer a development strategy which seeks to promote positive linkages between town and country and to promote self-sustaining rural and village communities.</P>
    <P>There is a strong focus on people in the way this strategy is being prepared. If it is to be successful, ownership of the strategy should be shared by our citizens generally and by the people who must implement it at local, regional and national level. I have been more than a little surprised, therefore, at comments from members of the Opposition in this House recently on the arrangements which have been made for the extensive participation in the preparation of the national spatial strategy by local and regional authorities, community groups, social partners, Departments, semi-State bodies and sectoral <Col N="880" /> interests, as well as individual citizens. The strategy has the potential to alter profoundly the way Ireland develops over the next 20 years. It is my view, a view apparently not shared by many in Opposition, that in an era of social partnership, as many people, groups and organisations as possible should be given every opportunity to contribute to its preparation.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with some environmental issues in the context of the motion before the House. Overall, Ireland's environmental quality remains relatively good in comparison with that of most other European countries. However, the motion draws our attention to the fact that economic growth over recent years is placing increasing pressure on the environment. The EPA's recent millennium report on the state of Ireland's environment identifies five main challenges facing the environment. These are reducing eutrophication of inland waterways, managing waste and preventing litter, protecting the urban environment, controlling greenhouse gas emissions and protecting natural resources.</P>
    <P>Eutrophication is identified as perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental problem. The phosphorous regulations made in 1998 will be important in helping to return the waters affected to a healthy condition. Record levels of investment in water services of £3 billion under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, development of catchment management strategies throughout the country, use of nutrient management planning, phase-out of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents and implementation of REPS are also among the key measures the Government has taken to secure and maintain good water quality.</P>
    <P>On waste issues, the regional waste management plans being developed within the policy framework, Changing our Ways, which I launched in 1998, will be integrated strategies, building on the recognised hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, reuse-recycling and disposal; some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the NDP and a programme of measures has been developed to complement local authority anti-litter action.</P>
    <P>In the major towns and cities, the elimination of leaded petrol and the extended bans on smoky coal, as well as other measures, have made a positive contribution to the improvement of urban air quality. However, the dramatic rise in vehicle numbers and use over recent years, referred to in the motion, means that more is required to meet new EU standards for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. The NDP commits to substantial investment in public transport over the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>As far as climate change is concerned, greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow at an unacceptable rate &ndash; if current trends persist, emissions will be nearly three times the Kyoto commitments by 2008 to 2012. I will shortly bring to Government for approval a draft national <Col N="881" /> greenhouse gas abatement strategy to set the framework for action to meet Ireland's Kyoto target.</P>
    <P>There is general recognition that there is room for improvement in relation to protecting the natural heritage. While substantial difficulties remain, progress has been made over recent years in terms of greater public information on and better resourcing for heritage protection.</P>
    <P>While action has been and is being taken to protect and enhance the environment, there is no room for complacency. Ireland has achieved an economic performance of which we can all be proud. The potential downside, in terms of damage to the environment and depletion of our natural resources, can only be avoided by resolute measures to step up environmental protection and make our development more eco-efficient. The Government is committed to doing this but responses are demanded from everyone. We are all involved in different ways in the choices that make a difference to our environment.</P>
    <P>I note that the Fine Gael motion calls for an accelerated roll-out of broadband high capacity telecommunications services to facilitate e-commerce business development. When this Government took office, the telecommunications market was very different from what it is now. For a start, it was not nearly as conducive to competition and growth as it is at present. That is due to the decisions of my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, to liberalise the market in December 1998, ahead of schedule. The telecommunications market is now much more than just voice telephony, as can be seen in the explosive growth in Internet use. The numbers using the Internet have more than doubled over the past year or so, and we believe that the Internet and e-commerce offer Ireland valuable opportunities for economic development and growth. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, will deal with this in greater detail tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, will deal with the specific issue of decentralisation. It is clear from what I said that the Government is committed to the objective of balanced regional development. We will achieve this mainly through a series of infrastructural programmes that will target investment of £20 billion at all regions, particularly those regions in which development has lagged behind. Better roads, increased serviced land, ramped up private and social housing output, modern public transport, enhanced waste management infrastructure together with improved telecommunications, energy and health facilities will all play a part in securing continued economic progress. The orientation of the national development plan, allied to the national spatial strategy, will ensure that future growth will be better balanced within and between regions.</P>
    <P>We accept that economic prosperity must be realised in tandem with and not at the expense of <Col N="882" /> our quality of life. That is why we speak of econ-omic and social progress. One example of social progress is the care we take to preserve and enhance our environment so that it can be enjoyed by all our people now and into the future.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support the amendment to the motion moved by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I listened with great interest to what he said and I am sure we all would agree with what is happening and what he has been doing in his Department.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to deal with the specific aspect of the programme of decentralisation announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, during the recent budget debate. The Government has a proud record in the establishment of an overall economic and social framework and has presided over record levels of economic growth and prosperity. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, outlined in some detail the initiatives being taken by the Government on regional development and the preparation of a national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>On budget day, the Minister for Finance announced a proposal to proceed with a new and extensive decentralisation programme. This announcement was an endorsement of an earlier Government commitment in the reviewed Action Programme for the Millennium to a policy of balanced regional development and set as a key priority the channeling of public sector jobs into provincial areas.</P>
      <P>In developing a new decentralisation programme, the Government has in mind a number of objectives including the promotion of regional development, the reduction of congestion in Dublin, the establishment of a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the procurement of office accommodation at lower cost than in Dublin city centre. In view of the contribution decentralisation will make to regional development, it is appropriate that some time should be spent addressing that important subject.</P>
      <P>I am glad my party has been to the forefront in the development of policies on decentralisation and can take great credit for spearheading the existing programme of decentralisation from Dublin to provincial towns and cities where it has acted as an important socio-economic stimulus. Some 4,000 public sector jobs have been relocated over the past 12 years or so. The impact of this programme cannot be underestimated, given that it involves almost 20 towns and cities throughout the country. I am far from alone in this House in having witnessed, at first hand, the benefits of decentralisation in my locality and community. As we come to the end of this round of decentralisation, it fair to say that it has been met with widespread satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may be surprised to learn that before <Col N="883" /> we embark on this new programme almost 50% of all civil servants are already located outside of Dublin. While decentralisation cannot account for all of that it has played a major part and contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. All regions have benefited from the Government's policy on decentralisation and it is the Government's intention that the new programme will maintain that policy. It is obvious that the addition of new jobs to an area, whether through decentralisation or otherwise, gives a positive economic boost to such an area. New jobs result in increased economic growth and better use of existing, and often under-used, local infrastructure.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed is a radical approach with the relocation of up to 10,000 jobs. Neither I nor my colleagues underestimate the extent of the challenge we have set ourselves in meeting that target. Notwithstanding the scale of that challenge, the Government is determined that the new programme will be the most ambitious and successful in the history of the State. The Government's determination has been bolstered by the quite extraordinary public reaction to the Minister's budget day announcement. My Department has received representations on behalf of or submissions from every country. These have included more than 90 cities, towns and villages anxious to accommodate a decentralised Government office. Cases have been made from areas ranging from suburban Dublin and Cork to small rural villages throughout the country. The Government's determination is such that we are not at this stage prepared to rule out any option which would ensure the programme's successful delivery.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies are aware by now that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently initiated an intensive series of meetings with his Government colleagues with the intention that he will be in a position to bring proposals before the Government in time for decisions to be taken on a new and extensive programme of decentalisation by the end of next month.</P>
    <P>I referred to the considerable public interest generated in the forthcoming programme and Deputies will be aware that interest has been reflected in this House and in the Seanad where the issue has been the subject of a considerable number of parliamentary questions, Adjournment debates, etc.</P>
    <P>Much of the interest in the forthcoming programme has centred on the locations to which decentralisation will take place. I have referred to the 90 or so cities, towns and villages throughout every county that have made their respective cases for inclusion in the new programme. The Government intends to give due consideration to all the submissions received and, when making final decisions, will take into account a large number of factors, such as the development needs of the various centres under consideration, the availability of suitable sites or office premises, transport links, capacity of local infrastructure, princi<Col N="884" /> pally water, sewerage and telecommunications, as outlined by the Minister for the Environment and local Government, population of the centre in relation to the numbers being relocated, proximity to third level education and the availability of housing and schools. That is to name but a few factors. There are many more, but that will give Members an understanding of some of the criteria being examined.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate that until such time as the Government has had the opportunity to consider all aspects relating to the new programme, it would not prudent of me to comment on the likelihood of any particular centre featuring in the programme. This is particularly the case given the number of centres anxious to be included. Given the level of interest this initiative has generated and the impact a new programme inevitably will have, I caution against any expectation that a large-scale relocation of public servants to provincial locations is imminent. Members of the House will appreciate that even after decisions have been taken to identify what should move and to where, it will be necessary to decide how this costly programme is to be financed and organised. It will be necessary to secure sites, observe planning procedures, design the buildings, appoint contractors and construct premises &ndash; all before staff can be transferred. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I am acutely aware of the existing constraints in the construction industry, but Deputies can be assured my office will work closely with the industry to ensure the programme is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible once decisions have been taken. In view of the importance of the new programme, I emphasise that I intend to take a personal interest in the programme's efficient delivery. I make this cautionary statement not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm on my part or that of the Government but simply to emphasise that after decisions are taken it will be some considerable time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>By way of confirming the Government's commitment to the new programme, I repeat the recent assurance given by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to the Committee on Finance and Public Service to the effect that the implementation of the programme will be given priority attention within the Department of Finance and that the programme will be pushed out vigorously. I can say from first-hand experience that very much is the case. Proper co-ordination will be ensured between the various Departments that will have a central role in the delivery of the programme, the Departments of Finance and Environment and Local Government as well as the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the very many worthwhile submissions I received on the subject of decentralisation and assure those who have made representations and presented submissions that they will be taken into account by the Government as part of the consultative process that has been initiated. <Col N="885" /> I reiterate the Government's commitment to ensuring the successful implementation of this new and radical programme of decentralisation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion proposed by Deputy Clune on behalf of the Fine Gael party. In many ways it complements the motion proposed by my party last week during Private Members' time which dealt specifically with the issue of housing. It, therefore, gives us an opportunity to critically evaluate the proposals the Government put forward last week to address the housing issue. It links housing with transport, planning, the needs of the community, the pressure on the environment as a result of development and the general quality of life enjoyed by our people.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate this evening , particularly in the contributions from the two Ministers who responded, I was struck by the utter lack of vision which the Government appears to have as to where this country is going. The country has prospered economically for some time. We have record levels of growth and investment and the Government has available to it record levels of revenue. That is something we all welcome. Yesterday Intel announced its intention to create another 1,000 jobs in Leixlip. It was interesting to note today that some of the media commentary on that announcement had to do with whether we are in a position to supply the skilled and educated labour which that type of industry requires given the prospect that this country may become the e-commerce hub of Europe. These are problems we could not possibly have imagined five or ten years ago. To some extent they are the problems of success. It is a success for which those of us in public life over the past decade can take a degree of credit because it did not happen by accident. However it creates new sets of problems. Those problems relate to the impact of the rapid development on the environment; the provision of housing, its availability and affordability; transport, child care and the quality of life we all experience.</P>
      <P>The sad thing is the lack of vision on the part of the Government. In the course of this debate I did not get any sense from either the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who has particular responsibility for the protection of the environment, the provision of housing and the major infrastructural development required to meet the development taking place, or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who has responsibility for the provision of the State's physical services, that the Government has a concept of where this country is going. We get a continuing mantra from Government that the&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with it because it is the core issue. There was an announcement that there would be a national spatial strategy, advertisements have been placed in the newspapers and documents have been released inviting the public to participate in a public consultation process thereon. That is welcome. It will take two years for the spatial strategy to be adopted. By the time the national spatial strategy is adopted and agreed we will be almost half way into the life of the national development plan. In other words, the Government is proceeding with the projects without any concept of what it is all about. While I would not expect the Government to automatically put in place a national spatial strategy I would expect some overview as to where this island is going and what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at what is happening in practice with the related issues of housing, planning and transport. In Dublin, for example, the largest urban conurbation, the city is growing enormously. There is a huge amount of suburban sprawl given the development of commuter towns all around the province of Leinster. The commuter belt for Dublin is an arc from Dundalk <Col N="887" /> across to Athlone and down to Wexford. What is the Government's policy and what is it trying to do? We know that the city of Dublin is growing. The point was made in one of this morning's newspapers that the physical size of the greater Dublin area is as big as Los Angeles &ndash; 40 miles from end to the other. Is there a policy that says Dublin will continue to develop or a strategy that says satellite suburban towns will be developed? Will Mullingar, Naas, Kildare, Gorey, Enniscorthy, Carlow and so on become satellite towns of Dublin? Is that the view? We need a statement from Government about what is being developed. We can see that two things are happening in parallel although they do not appear to be related. One is the continued expansion of the conurbation of Dublin, the other is the development of satellite towns. Both developments are exacerbated by the difficulties people have accessing affordable housing.</P>
    <P>Consider, for example, the 1,000 employees who will take up the new job opportunities being offered in Leixlip. Where will they live? Will they live in north Kildare or will they travel from Athlone or Mullingar? Will they be like a person I heard about recently&mdash;</P>

That results in two problems.

      <P>The Government's regional strategy, such as it is, is not based on the real regional requirements of the country. It was manufactured to fit a European funding mould.

    <P>In the core areas addressed by the motion the Government has been a pathetic failure. In the <Col N="890" /> case of the environment, under the Kyoto protocol and the basket of commitments agreed by the European Union as Europe's contribution to meeting the Kyoto targets, Ireland was allowed generous increases to its emission levels. The Government has failed to adhere to those targets.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was extraordinary. He said that Ireland is about to overshoot the Kyoto targets by a factor of three but he still has not put before the House the reduction strategy he has been promising for three years. We also have not seen any of the proposals which were launched in the Programme for Government with regard to eco auditing Government policies and measures. There have been no proposals for the introduction of eco taxation and no serious effort has been made to present the national greenhouse gas abatement strategy which has also been promised for three years.</P>
    <P>The Government has been seriously negligent of the domestic environment. There is chaos in relation to waste management. There are problems in virtually every county either in relation to the provision of landfill dumps or incineration. There appears to be no national waste strategy. A policy document was issued in 1988 called &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo; which changed nothing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Howlin: I hope I made a convincing case to the Minister. The import of amendments Nos. 15 and 17 is to modify the Minister's proposal in section 5(2)(<i>b</i>) relating to applications for judicial review. I have outlined the case as best I can. Amendment No. 15 seeks to ensure that the normal provision where judicial review is applied for <i>ex parte</i> is maintained for all applications, including those related to asylum. Amendment No. 17 seeks to substitute &ldquo;is an arguable case&rdquo;, to allow for normal grounds for application for judicial review, for &ldquo;are substantial grounds&rdquo;. It would mean putting a much higher level of case if the Minister's proposals are accepted. This applies only to planning matters. It is an important area of civil liberties and human rights and it is important that we do not set hurdles for access to judicial review which are higher than any other <Col N="891" /> procedure in our law or administration. I have heard no coherent reasons to date that these particular hurdles should be put in place. I hope my arguments are convincing to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, either the Minister can coherently and comprehensively argue why the uniqueness of the asylum issues require these higher hurdles to be put in place or he argues that there is a deficiency in the general administration procedure for judicial review, and the same should apply to all. He has done neither to date and I await his response.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> My amendment No. 16 seeks to remove from the Bill the provision that asylum seekers are requested at the stage of application for judicial review to present substantial grounds for contending that the decision, determination, recommendation, refusal or order is invalid or ought to be quashed. It is wholly wrong that any such provision would be included in any law of this land. I object to having these measures dealing with people seeking asylum inserted in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill on the day following the appalling tragedy at Dover when 58 Chinese nationals suffocated while attempting to get into Britain. It is particularly inappropriate that the Minister should have mixed up measures dealing with the gangsters who traffic in human beings and make massive profits from that with the victims of those gangsters, the suffering and vulnerability of whom we have tragically seen in the past 24 hours. The Minister should pause and think again about inserting into the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill measures strictly curbing the rights of innocent asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an appalling precedent for the Government to insert into the laws of the land a method of dealing with asylum seekers which is second class in the extreme to the normal treatment before the law of citizens of this country. It is discriminatory, unfair, invidious and a very bad departure on the part of the Government. It is clear from custom and practice as it has developed in the courts in the past ten, 15 or 20 years that everyone who comes before the courts, regardless of their nationality, should be treated equally. Article 40 of the Constitution states that people shall be treated fairly in the eyes of the law in having access to the courts. It is clear also from Article 16 of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights that the Government is in breach of that article. The section dealing with access to the courts states that a refugee shall have free access to the courts of law in the territory of all contracting states. A refugee shall enjoy in the contracting state in which he has his habitual residence the same treatment as a national in matters pertaining to access to the courts. The United Nations High Commissioner believes that asylum seekers should have the same rights and guarantees as refugees. Therefore, the Minister is in breach of these conven<Col N="892" /> tions, imperfect though they may be. The measure of protection afforded by these conventions is being breached by the Minister in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The reason the Minister has included in this Bill the provision severely limiting access to the courts to asylum seekers rather than in an immigration Bill or the Refugee Act is because it would not stand up to the scrutiny of the courts. If it was inserted into the Refugee Act, it would be in direct contradiction to the Schedule of that Act, the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees, which I quoted.</P>
    <P>Barristers who appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights stated that any statutory restriction on the right of judicial review must be interpreted in the context of the object and purpose of the Act. That is why the Minister drags it into the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill instead of inserting it into other legislation where it would clash with the rights that have to be granted to asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister expect that a substantial case can be presented within 14 days of a decision? With so much resting on a judicial review, barristers presenting the case for the applicant would have to make the substantial case at the point of application for judicial review. That will take up a considerable amount of time. They will have to present virtually the full case because to do otherwise would risk weakening it and if there was an unfavourable decision, the last resort is then finished. Many asylum seekers will be dependent on the free Legal Aid Board to make their cases. How does the Minister believe an applicant who has been refused asylum will have time to contact the Legal Aid Board in Cahirciveen &ndash; which is grossly under-funded &ndash; and get proper representation within 14 days? It is an incredible provision.</P>
    <P>The implication behind the reduction of the time for judicial review to 14 days is that cases appealing decisions made by the Minister are vexatious and without merit. It was clearly demonstrated by the lawyers who appeared before the committee that 30 such cases had already been taken and that there had been an arguable case and reasonable grounds in all of them. No case was thrown out &ndash; the Minister won one case and settled or lost the others. What evidence is there that vexatious cases have been taken when the Minister either settled or lost? The only conclusion is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is taking the appallingly crude advice of a fellow constituency TD that these unfortunate people should be shown the way out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This provision is entirely unjust and unprecedented. As Deputy Howlin pointed out, only in planning law has there also been a foreshortening of the time period for a judicial review and the reduction there is to two months. In planning we are dealing with land and buildings while here we are dealing with people with human rights, who <Col N="893" /> have lost a great deal already and who have a future in front of them. The Minister, by including this provision, severely curtails their rights and their ability to be heard by the courts in cases where he has refused their applications.</P>

        <b>:</b> I will be brief because I would like to hear the Minister's reply to the cogent arguments put forward by Deputies Joe Higgins and Howlin. I remind the House of the manner in which the former Independent Appeals Commissioner, Peter Finlay, was so incensed by this provision, and the manner in which the Minister has attempted to graft a whole new dimension on to the Bill, that he felt compelled to appear before the joint committee and offer his view on how this flouted the constitutional rights of asylum seekers. He also referred to the practicalities of the Bill, describing it as lamentable, inoperable, uninspired and ill considered.</P>

        <b>:</b> As I said on Committee Stage, it would be hard to find seven more apt adjectives to dismiss something as thoroughly flawed, something the Minister sees as fundamental to the regulation of the inflow of immigrants to this State.</P>
      <P>Not alone is the Minister determined to remove the constitutional rights of people by reducing the time for judicial review from three months, as it remains for Irish citizens, to 14 days, he is now determined to move the goal posts again by changing the requirements for judicial review. Three weeks ago, a brave man called Dennis Riordan had the courage to go before the High Court to seek a judicial review of the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the vice presidency of the European Investment Bank. He appeared before Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, who decided that there was a case to be heard on the basis that Mr. Riordan had an arguable case. The grounds required for a judicial review of an appointment to the vice presidency of the European Investment Bank are an arguable case. We are talking about the fundamental human rights of the people such as those who were unfortunate enough to be on the ferry from Zeebrugge to Dover yesterday or those who have come into member states by various methods to seek humanitarian protection. We are not prepared to allow them the constitutional protection we give to our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By ploughing ahead regardless, the Minister is thwarting his own determination to bring in the legislation. The lawyers who came before the committee are adamant that this is unconstitutional, Mr. Finlay believes it is unconstitutional and most people outside who are up to date on these matters agree. By introducing two new areas to the Bill, the Minister is frustrating measures we would commend. We were all in fav<Col N="894" /> our of a Bill to end the commercial exploitation of human misery. A fundamentally good Bill has been destroyed by the Minister's determination to graft on provisions which have changed the thrust of the Bill. The Minister cannot say he was not warned.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 15 seeks to remove from the Government the requirement that applications for leave to seek judicial review are to be on notice to the Minister, as distinct from being<i> ex parte</i> as is the position at present. It is an essential element of the Government's proposal that the Minister of the day be in a position to argue from the outset as to whether leave should be granted for judicial review in particular cases. It is relatively easy, on the basis of selective presentation by an applicant's lawyer of the facts of a particular case uncontroverted by a proper representative of the respondent in the case, to persuade the court that there is a substantial case for permitting judicial review of a decision or step taken. Deputy Howlin seemed to believe that, in some way, this was meant as a criticism of barristers who present cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not meant as a criticism, it is merely a statement of what actually happens. Court records show that, without doubt, applicants' lawyers engage in selective presentation. I am not making an allegation or an accusation, I am merely stating the facts. However, I intend no criticism of a particular barrister. Any advocate must do his best for his client.</P>
      <P>If there is a dispute as to the facts on which the applicant bases the application for judicial review, if there are substantial gaps in the facts put before the court or if there are arguments to be put before the court as to why leave should not be granted in a particular case, it is vital and fair that the court should hear the other side when the application for leave is made in order that it can arrive at a balanced view and make its decision accordingly. It should be remembered that the court is being asked, at this point, to decide that there is real substance on which to base the grant of leave to seek a judicial review. It is not enough that arguments which are merely plausible are offered, particularly when based on a presentation of the facts which can be expected to favour the applicant's side of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the provision is to ensure that if the processing of a person's case &ndash; be that the consideration of a deportation order, the removal of an asylum applicant to another Dublin Convention country to have the application considered there or the substantive consideration of an asylum claim in the State &ndash; is to be delayed, perhaps for a considerable period, pending the outcome of High Court proceedings and possibly appeal proceedings in the Supreme Court, then there are substantial reasons to justify that delay. <Col N="895" /> In that context, this provision should not be presented merely as a measure for asylum seekers. A substantive reading of the subsection makes clear that not only does it relate to asylum seekers, it also relates to others of a different status.</P>

      <P>That being the case, it is important that the court should have marshalled before it, at the earliest possible opportunity, the relevant facts and the arguments of both sides so that it can decide whether the basis for any potential delay is substantial.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin inquired to whom the provision also applies. I wish to correct what I said earlier by stating that a person's claim will be determined by the time he or she seeks a judicial review into whether the procedures were properly observed.</P>

      <P>It should not be the case that the first the Minister or his officials or the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal know of an application for judicial review in these areas is a report in the following morning's paper. The <i>ex parte</i> grant of leave to seek judicial review under present conditions means that, at a minimum, there is a delay of three weeks. The grant of leave <i>ex parte</i> in these cases at present is, it seems, appealable only to the Supreme Court. Such appeal proceedings could add considerably to the delay. Accordingly, in order that the High Court can arrive at a proper decision on whether there is sufficient substance to the applicant's argument to warrant postponement of further action on his or her case, it is essential for the court to hear both sides on that aspect of the matter at the very beginning. It is perfectly reasonable that the court should hear the other person's side of the case at this point. I see no difficulty with that.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 go even further in their provisions by seeking to remove, in the case of amendment No. 16, the requirement that leave to apply for judicial review not be granted unless there are substantial grounds, or, in the case of amendment No. 17, that &ldquo;an arguable case&rdquo; replace the requirement to show substantial grounds. Neither approach is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continued processing of a case in the immi<Col N="896" /> gration or asylum area should not be delayed by the existence of court proceedings unless there is a substantial, not merely an arguable, case to be made which would justify such delay. Nor can I accept that this provision be dispensed with entirely. To do this would make little sense in the context of the cases covered in this scheme of judicial review.</P>
    <P>The courts have already given dicta on the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;substantial grounds&rdquo; in similar statutory contexts. The effect of the judgments to date is that the grounds in question must be reasonable, weighty and that they must not be trivial or tenuous. It has also been determined by the courts that, regardless of the importance of the issue involved, a ground cannot be substantial if it cannot succeed. That is logical. These clarifications by the courts of this expression confirm the appropriateness of substantial grounds as distinct from merely an arguable case as a basis for allowing court procedures to delay the progress of particular immigration or asylum cases.</P>
    <P>Let us consider, for example, the deportation process under the Immigration Act, 1999, which sets out a detailed step-by-step process for dealing with persons who are liable for deportation. That process culminates either in the making of a deportation order or in permission to remain in the State being given or renewed. The steps are, in broad terms, as follows: first, the person in question is formally notified that deportation is under consideration, informed about the reasons for its being considered and invited to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made; next, once the time for making representations is exhausted, the Minister must consider all aspects of the case, including the list of considerations set out at section 3(6) of that Act, and taking into account whatever representations have been made; then, if the Minister decides that the person should leave the State, a deportation order is made, and the person is notified of the order and told to report on a specified date to the authorities so that the departure can be arranged.</P>
    <P>The process to which I refer is generous. It affords the person in question the opportunity to make out the best case possible to the Minister and for the Minister to take that case into consideration. The typical duration between commencement and conclusion of the process is 11 weeks, or just under three months. The person in question can, at any stage of that process, seek judicial review of the steps taken thus far in the case. If a merely arguable case were put to the High Court that there has been a procedural defect in the processing of the case so far or if, as Deputy Joe Higgins's amendment proposes, no grounds whatsoever had to be shown, the existence of the judicial review proceedings could serve to postpone the final outcome for many months &ndash; in some cases the period of delay could be as long as two years &ndash; regardless of whether there was a procedural flaw in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Under the section as it stands, the careful and <Col N="897" /> painstaking process leading to the final decision &ndash;  whether that be to deport or otherwise &ndash; will be delayed only in cases where the court is satisfied that there is a substantial case to be made that the step under challenge was procedurally unsound. That is a sensible basis for permitting delay in the process and for ensuring that there is no unfair treatment of the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15 and 17 in Deputy Howlin's name seek, in effect, to retain a procedure in immigration and asylum cases which applies also to all kinds of unrelated cases. Deputy Joe Higgins's amendment would go further and allow judicial review proceedings on demand without any grounds whatsoever. The continued application of the current, necessarily general, provisions to immigration and asylum cases, as distinct from the provisions of section 5 designed to meet the specific requirements of such cases, is unwarranted for reasons which I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>The law will work better from the point of view of the administration of justice and fairness to all parties on the basis of substantial grounds for judicial review determined by the court at the preliminary stage on the basis of facts and arguments from both sides, as section 5 proposes. The Deputies' amendments, in my view, are unsustainable.</P>
    <P>Listening to Members' comments, one would imagine that there is no due process prior to the making of an application for judicial review. We must remember that the individual concerned is entitled to make his or her application for asylum which will then be considered in a substantive manner. He or she also has the right to appeal a negative decision in respect of his or her application. The person concerned, if he or she so wishes, can then make an application to the Minister of the day to be allowed to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds. Finally, he or she has the option of seeking to establish that the procedures employed were flawed in some way by taking a case to the High Court. During the entire process, applicants can avail of legal aid. There is no question of the process being summarily dismissive because each of the procedures relating to it must be followed.</P>
    <P>Arguments have been advanced today to the effect that the requirement that the High Court must be satisfied that a substantive case exists before granting leave to apply for a judicial review somehow places too heavy an obligation on the applicant's counsel in preparing a case for court and that two weeks is insufficient time for a lawyer to put together a substantive case. These arguments ignore the fact that all decisions which may be challenged under this proposal, listed at subsection (1), are decisions about which the Minister has an obligation not only to inform the applicant but also to outline the reasons for them.</P>
    <P>Decisions which may be the subject of judicial review under this proposal are almost invariably the result of extensive prior contact with the per<Col N="898" /> son in question during which he or she would nor-mally have availed of the opportunity to take legal advice. In many instances, continuing legal advice and interpretative facilities are provided at the expense of the State. In those circumstances, I cannot accept that where there is a substantive case to be made and where there has been a procedural flaw in the process, it would be beyond the competence of a lawyer to proceed with expedition.</P>
    <P>In the case of an asylum seeker, all relevant documentation in relation to his or her application and any appeal is available at each stage of the application process. The existing administrative arrangements provide for a thorough consideration of each application. Applications which are examined substantively are examined to determine whether the applicant meets the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; as outlined in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996. The applicant is given a full interview and an opportunity to make submissions. Where a person is not recognised as a refugee, he or she is entitled to avail of the independent appeals process. The appeals are determined by an appeals authority comprising a barrister or solicitor with at least five years' practice. The appeals authority is provided with all the information provided to the applicant and with such submissions as may be made by or on behalf of the application in connection with the appeal. Legal aid and interpretative facilities are provided at all stages of the determination process.</P>
    <P>Under the Refugee Act these procedures are on a statutory and independent footing thereby providing further certainty to the applicant. By the time a case reaches finality, the substance of the case will be clear to all concerned and full documentation, including decisions and reasons, concerning the basis of a judicial review application will be available.</P>
    <P>Where issues of complexity arise, the High Court has the power under subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) to extend the time in which people may apply for judicial review where it is satisfied that sufficient reasons exist to do so. I do not agree that this is a provision which seeks to restrict access to the courts. It will fundamentally ensure that applications for leave to apply for judicial review are dealt with fairly and speedily. If the provision is one which applies to a particular group of persons, namely, those subject to asylum and immigration procedures, it is not for the purpose of singling these people out; rather it is to ensure that they will be satisfied that they will be dealt with in an open and transparent manner under consistent procedures which have integrity and reflect the State's obligations to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Jim Higgins' point, the issues and facts in any one case are very clear by the time a decision is issued and every decision is supported with reasons. The law applicable is quite self-contained and I do not see why any reasonably competent barrister should not be able to master such a brief within 14 days. All <Col N="899" /> that is required is that the proceedings would be brought within 14 days. Thereafter, the time limits for the delivery of the relevant pleadings is a matter for the rules of the superior courts and the discretion of the judge. On the Deputy's assertion that this measure is unconstitutional in some way, I can only say that I must take the advice of the first law officer in the land, the Attorney General, who is given the responsibility under the Constitution to advise the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to the passage of the legislation and the length of time it took to come to the House, the suggestion that I delayed the processing of this Bill in some way is complete nonsense. I have at all times pressed for the early processing of this legislation and any delays which arose occurred as a result of the demands placed on the House by other business. I sought to present the Bill to the House at an early date and I was grateful that Second Stage could be taken last November. I continually pressed for an early date for Committee Stage but the workload of the select committee did not permit an early hearing. Accordingly, following the hearing of evidence in February, the Bill finally went into committee at the end of March. Following completion of Committee Stage, the earliest available debate for commencement of Report Stage was the end of May. I have been more frustrated than anybody else by this delay but I do not intend at this point to lay any blame on anybody for it. The more one considers the matter, it would appear that other business placed demands on the House. I take great exception to the suggestion that I, having introduced the Bill and sought its early processing at all times, should be accused of delaying its passage. It is nonsensical to suggest that I would want to delay my own Bill.</P>
    <P>These issues have been debated comprehensively. I call a spade a spade and my reasons for introducing these judicial review measures are quite simple. I do not want a situation to arise whereby the judicial review procedure will become a mechanism to further lengthen an already lengthy process. I do not believe there is anything to be gained from allowing a situation to develop where people can use judicial review proceedings to prolong the process when they do not have any case.</P>
    <P>Ample safeguards are contained in the legislation. It is clear that if an individual can outline to the court that a case exists, the court will ensure that his or her case will be heard. I cannot be any fairer than that. Due process, natural justice and transparency are evident throughout the proceedings and legal aid and interpretative facilities are also provided.</P>
    <P>Some people may object to the provision relating to judicial review and I respect their decision to oppose my view. Deputy Joe Higgins's allegation to the effect that all judicial review proceedings have either been settled or lost by the State is simply incorrect and does not have any basis whatsoever in fact. I do not know where he <Col N="900" /> got his information but he has clearly been misinformed.</P>

      <P>We should not confuse the concept of judicial review with an application for asylum <i>per se</i>. It must be remembered that a judicial review is about whether the procedures applied in the processing of an application were applied correctly. It is about whether the procedures were flawed.

      <P>I am saying that a person has 14 days after all the procedures have been undergone to challenge those procedures. People have 14 days to establish whether they have a <i>prima facie</i> case. I do not see anything wrong with that. I am merely asking that the Minister of the day would receive notice in order that he or she would be in a position to advance his or her own argument. At the end of the day, this is a matter for the court. It is not as if either of the sides involved will make the decision. I believe this proposal is fair and balanced.</P>
      <P>I am at a complete loss as to the foundation for Deputy Joe Higgins's statement. He asked me to provide the facts and I will now establish beyond any doubt that his comment is at complete variance with the facts. In the period 1997 to the end of February 2000, a total of 52 asylum or immigration related judicial review applications were made and judgments were also handed down in a number of cases in which judicial review had been sought prior to that time. Of the 52 applications made in that period, 32 cases are ongoing and cannot, therefore, have been struck down. Nine cases were struck out by the court; three applications were withdrawn by the applicants; seven applications were granted or part-granted and one application has been heard but no order has yet been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the nine cases struck out, three applicants were granted permission to remain as the parents of an Irish child and so there was no point in pursuing the litigation. Four applicants were admitted to the asylum process in view of the delay arising from the absence of a power to deport as the result of the proceedings in the Laurentiu <Col N="901" /> case. These were cases where the asylum application was appropriate for consideration in a Dublin Convention country, where the applicant had already either applied for or had an opportunity to apply for refugee status, in which the time limits for removal had expired during the post Laurentiu period or when there was no statutory power to remove the applicant. One case was struck out and admitted to the asylum process and one case was re-admitted to the asylum process because it could not be proven that a refusal letter had been received by an applicant.</P>
    <P>Of the seven cases granted leave to apply or part granted such leave, six, including Laurentiu, were granted or in most cases part granted because of the finding in relation to deportation powers in the Laurentiu case. The remaining case related to procedural grounds.</P>
    <P>It is easy for commentators to make assertions of a greater or lesser degree of verifiability in support of an argument they want to make, particularly in circumstances where there is little or no prospect of such assertions being challenged. As a party to the proceedings however, in all these cases I owe it to the courts, the applicants and to this House to act with prudence in relation to any comments that might be made on the cases in question. I cannot, therefore, address the assertions about these judicial review cases as fully as I might like because of the <i>sub judice </i>rule.</P>
    <P>With regard to the terrible tragedy at Dover, I share the House's deepest concern and I express my deepest sympathy to the relatives of the tragic victims. This is an appalling case. It is deeply sad and words cannot express the revulsion and horror I feel for those who may have been involved in the trafficking of these vulnerable people. I have been saying for a considerable period that there was no doubt that people were being trafficked into Europe and Ireland. That is my principal reason for bringing forward this legislation. There may be elements of this Bill which some Members may not like, but none of it is meant to undermine the dignity of any human being, far from it. It is intended to be fair and honest, balanced and reasonable. Above all, it is intended to ensure that the asylum process itself is respected and that the 1951 Convention is enforced properly. It is intended to ensure that there is no open door policy in relation to immigration.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I was in France and met the French authorities. My understanding of the situation in France is that there may be up to 10,000 asylum applicants every month this year. This is a very large number. There is very little doubt but that trafficking exists between Cherbourg, for example, and Rosslare. That has been the case for some time. Fortunately, most people who come to Ireland by that route do so as foot passengers. While that fact is welcome, no individual has the right to abuse the asylum process. People are held to be illegal immigrants only after fair procedures have been gone through.</P>
    <P>I accept that people have grave criticisms of my policy and of the legislation. I respect them for <Col N="902" /> their opinions. However, I must do what the Government believes is right. In that context, this legislation is correct and will stand the test of time. These are the reasons, with the greatest respect, I reject the amendments.</P>

      <P>I will attempt a brief response to the Minister's half hour speech containing much information and a moving homily, for which Members are grateful.</P>
      <P>The Minister's general arguments do not hold water. The notion that the Minister wanted this legislation enacted speedily and that the vagaries of the House, the truculence of Whips and the difficulties of committees put obstacles in his path does not hold water. The Bill was delayed because the Minister constantly moved the goal posts and added further amendments which had nothing to do with trafficking in asylum seekers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister, during his half hour speech, was not admonished in that way. I confined my original remarks to amendments Nos. 15 and 17 but the Minister, in his speech, travelled from Paris <i>via</i> Cherbourg to Rosslare and gave a very lame justification of his own inaction.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears not to understand what judicial review is about. I am surprised to hear this from a trained and expert lawyer. Judicial review is not an administrative matter. The Minister cannot decide if it suits the State or balance the rights of the State against the rights of an individual. The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that administration is proper, fair and complies with the law. It is not for the Minister to make that judgment. It is for the courts, under our system, to do so. People must have access to the courts on an equal basis and not on the basis that it suits the State or the Minister. The Minister wishes to have a particular course of action for reviewing procedure in asylum cases which is different from all other cases. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I am profoundly disappointed that the Minister did not address the fundamental points in the two amendments. The first is the issue of <i>ex parte </i>as opposed to notice when the norm is that people have instant access. The second is the issue of substantive issues being put <i>ab initio. </i>I speak only of the right to launch a case, not to argue it.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am glad the Minister has quoted facts and figures. I shall study them in the Official Report. The Minister's figures do not support to his implicit contention that vexatious or frivolous cases have been brought to the High Court for judicial review. According to the Minister, approximately 20 cases were decided, seven were granted, which is one third, and others fall into various categories which I do <Col N="903" /> not remember exactly. There is nothing to show a wholesale trivial approach to judicial review, which is the main ground on which the Minister bases his case for inserting this measure in the Bill. The Minister is prejudging the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state why so much concern was expressed regarding this section. The recent tragedy in Dover and the knowledge that criminals are profiting by such traffic give the Bill an extra urgency. The Bill would have been enacted a long time ago had the Minister not introduced this measure when submissions had already been made by people engaged in judicial and humanitarian support for refugees. Without notice to us as parliamentarians or them, we were presented with something that really has nothing to do with this Bill or should have nothing to do with it. The members of a select committee were allowed to take oral submissions because it is part of the consultative process of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to do so. The submissions on this addition to the Bill were among the most passionate, committed and justified that were ever received during my experience of the committee. They cannot be marginalised or sidelined because they came from experts in the field. The committee received them in an all-party manner, being in no way partisan or wishing to delay this Bill which is of such urgency. In the democracy we must exercise in this House and in the committees, in particular, that was the time needed to take those submissions.</P>
      <P>We come again to the basic flaw in the Bill which related to a point of the most fundamental constitutional concern, that is, since the early 1980s jurisprudence has established that Article 40 of the Constitution guarantees access to and equality before the law to every person by virtue of their humanity alone, not how they came to Ireland or how they were treated once they came, but on their humanity alone.</P>
      <P>In addition, Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantee the right to a fair trial and effective domestic remedy to all persons within the party states. Thus, national and international law prohibit discrimination by the State against persons appearing before the courts, be they national or non-national. Equality before the law is a basic human right. The Minister in his long response to Deputies Howlin, Joe Higgins and Jim Higgins made the point that the process would be seen as fair and transparent. Evidently it is not seen in that way by a large number of people of whom it will be demanded to implement and process this part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limiting applications to the High Court, where the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision, determination, recommendation or refusal is invalid, gives direction to the courts which raises all kinds of problems about the separation of the <Col N="904" /> Executive and Judiciary. In addition, we know, even from the list that the Minister gave with regard to the cases that are already being processed, that it is claimed by the practitioners who will have to try to process this that to establish substantial grounds within 14 days, taking into account the necessity of detailed instructions, translation facilities and briefing counsel, is simply unduly onerous. The whole process may break down and be brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister that if we use the same sense of urgency in the process with regard to people's access to the country and the process through which they would go before judicial review became applicable to them, it would probably would be a greater use of our energy and our humanitarianism. It is extraordinary that we would try to congest this into 14 days when one of the most difficult experiences of refugees applying here and for people dealing with them is the undue delay because of the lack of process already.</P>
    <P>In his response the Minister said that it was a process that could be prepared within 14 days and it really would not take that much preparatory work. However, I have been informed by practitioners within the law that this demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of judicial review. The instructions necessary to ground an application for judicial review will not be the same as those already received relating to an asylum application, as the merits of the substantive case are not relevant to the judicial review process. Relevant instructions will only arise when the refusal has been handed down and preparation along different lines will then have to be made. It is not right to say that this is a rerun and will only take 14 days. This matter must be taken very seriously with regard to the recognition and acknowledgement of the law and the courts.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister, as we have done during the sitting of the select committee. We honestly believe, not wishing to be contentious, that this is unconstitutional because it unfairly prejudices persons before the Irish courts who are non-nationals and nationals. I take the Minister's point and I do not question his commitment to and compassion for refugees and people who are making their case to remain in this country. However, he said that nothing would be done to undermine their dignity. By proposing that our courts and the Constitution treat refugees and asylum seekers in different ways from people already living in this country who regard themselves as citizens, we are saying that we are offending their dignity and that they do not have the same status, dignity and rights under the Constitution and in the courts. It is a sad day if Parliament introduces such a two-tier system. Even now, we ask the Minister to consider this issue very carefully. It is causing much of the delay, although not an undue delay as this is one of the most fundamental, just and fair changes to a Bill that we have ever tried to argue and, hopefully, win in this House.</P>

      <P>There is nothing wrong with drawing distinctions once the basis for the distinctions serves a legitimate legislative purpose and is not unreasonably discriminatory. To put it succinctly, the purpose here is to provide for the first time in primary legislation a statutory code for judicial review of steps taken and decisions made in the asylum and immigration process which will facilitate the expeditious determination by the High Court of the procedure of validity or otherwise of those decisions.</P>
      <P>I have never at any stage suggested that I would be making the decision. All I said was that the court would decide whether a person had grounds to bring forward a judicial review case. I am not asking any individual to establish his or her case within 14 days of the decision having been made. All I am asking him or her to do is establish within that period that he or she has grounds upon which the court should hear the case in a substantive way. Also, there is provision in subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) that such an application would be made to the court within the 14 days unless the High Court considers that there is good and sufficient reason for extending the period within which the application shall be made. There is that saver as well.</P>
      <P>I am not denying anybody access to court but it appears to me that Members of the House, in insisting that this should stay as an <i>ex parte</i> application, are insisting that I or any of my successors on behalf of the people should not have access to the court because if the Minister should not be put on notice, that is not fair to the public.</P>

      <P>This is a fundamental issue and I regret that Deputy Higgins and others do not have a further opportunity to contribute on these amendments. I further regret that we only have two hours in total to deal with a series of other important amendments. The Minister has decided to entirely ignore my arguments in regard to amendments Nos. 15 and 17. The case he put was entirely disingenuous in terms of the notion that the normal judicial review procedure available to every citizen for any action he takes somehow is discriminatory against him. That is the import of what he said. He must have the application on notice, otherwise he would be excluded from the judicial review process.</P>

Is it not a fact that a judicial review taken against him is carried out on <i>ex parte</i> basis <Col N="907" /> in regard to any administrative decision for which he is responsible should a citizen want to have it tested in terms of its fairness? If the Minister believes that is discriminatory, the only way we could be convinced is if he proposed in legislation to delimit all applications for judicial review in the way he proposes to delimit the category of exclusions implicit in this legislation. They all relate to immigration or deportation matters. His argument does not hold water. It is vacuous and absolutely groundless.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 17, the Minister again wishes to change the ground rules to remove arguable case, which is the basis of any other application for judicial review. This refers to getting off the ground an application for judicial review, not a determination, but the Minister in regard to this category of administrative decision or action wants substantial grounds to be provided in a tight timeframe of 14 days on notice to the Minister so that he can argue against the substantial grounds from day one.</P>

      <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;calling a spade a spade&rdquo; earlier and that is what he wants to do. It would be honest of him if he said that he wants to put the highest hurdles in place to fast track as many people out of Ireland as he can and if there are unfortunate consequences where the normal judicial review pro<Col N="908" /> cedure would determine mistakes, so be it. That is what he is saying.</P>
      <P>Let me warn him, as others have, that this amendment must meet a number of hurdles. The first is its constitutionality and enough has been said about that by Deputy Barnes, myself and others. Another opt out is contained in section 5(2)(<i>a</i>). The Minister introduced proposals in the House some time ago to impose mandatory ten year jail sentences on drug traffickers above a certain threshold. He will recall the argument we had in that regard. It is interesting to note the statistics. The courts have decided that every case they have dealt with so far is an exception which does not require the application of that mandatory code. If the Minister pushes his amendment through, the High Court will consider good and sufficient reasons for extending the 14 day period despite what he wants, because it will not be thwarted in its determination to treat all human beings equally, citizens and non-citizens, by virtue of their humanity.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his response referred to his visit to Paris and Cherbourg. I could have a long conversation with him regarding the need for tightening controls at the port of Cherbourg. I hope he engaged in positive dialogue with his French counterpart in that regard. More than a year ago I wrote to the French ambassador about this because I predicted the type of awful tragedy that befell those unfortunate people in Dover yesterday and that one day a container would be opened in Rosslare and a similar tragedy would be witnessed. I have spoken to an ambulance attendant who had to treat desperately dehydrated people falling out of the back of a lorry in Rosslare. I hope his dialogue in France had more effect than my communications with the French ambassador or the letter of the Select Committee on Justice, Defence, Equality and Women's Rights which I proposed should be sent to both the UK and British authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong in regard to this set of amendments. His arguments do not hold water and he has not made the case effectively. There is nothing further to be said because the Minister is determined to follow this course. If he forces this through the House, it will be challenged somewhere else.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 43 to 50 and in page 8, to delete lines 1 to 6.</P>
      <P>I will not hold up the debate because the onset of its closure is imminent and there are many important amendments to deal with yet, particularly in the name of Deputy Howlin, in relation to further methods of executing deportation orders. Basically, this amendment closes off the right of appeal. Section 5(3)(<i>a</i>) states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The determination of the High Court of an application for leave to apply for judicial review as aforesaid or of an application for such judicial review shall be final and no appeal shall lie from the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court in either case except with the leave of the High Court which leave shall only be granted where the High Court certifies <Col N="910" /> that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>So, it should be in the public interest and it should be of exceptional public importance. Clearly, what is involved here is another curtailment of their constitutional rights. Already we have seen in quick succession that the fundamental constitutional rights of people, as enshrined in the Constitution and upheld by the courts, have been flouted. The period for a judicial review has been reduced from three months to 14 days. In addition, a substantial case must be made to gain a judicial review, rather than an arguable case. There will be limited access to the High Court and now a person's access to the Supreme Court has been cut off.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with broiler chickens that have to be produced within 14 or 21 days. This is not a conveyor belt or a mechanical project. We are talking about the fundamental rights of people who should be entitled to have their cases properly heard by the courts. We are discussing all the idiosyncrasies and intricacies of a particular case and no two cases will be the same. No two cases of people coming from Angola will be the same, let alone one coming from Angola and another from Romania.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barnes said, would that the Minister would apply the same degree of speed and efficiency to the asylum procedures both at the initial and appeal stages, as he is trying to do here by flouting people's constitutional entitlements.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> This is another extraordinary proposal by the Minister, further consolidating his all-out attack on the human rights afforded to asylum seekers. It further delimits their rights before the courts in contrast to citizens of this country. It is extraordinary that in this Bill, introduced to deal with gangsters at whom the Minister is supposed to be aiming his gun, some of his powerful salvoes are aimed at the victims of the gangsters in severely delimiting their rights. On this day of all days, we should remember that it is not just traffickers who create the problems that finished in the tragedy at Dover. Poverty, destitution, economic collapse, political and religious persecution, and the multinationals' exploitation of poor countries, all create conditions where innocent people put their lives on the line in order to have a better life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite incredible that in the same legislation that criminalises the traffickers, the Minister is delimiting the right of innocent victims both of economic and political conditions, and in some cases of gangster traffickers also. We would do well to keep in mind that despite all the laws, traffickers, unfortunately, thrive on the conditions that give rise to the horrific heroin problem here, just as they thrive on the conditions that created the terrible tragedy at Dover. Therefore, removing the conditions is the best way of removing the traffickers who deal in human lives. However, <Col N="911" /> instead of providing comfort to the victims of those terrible conditions of poverty and persecution, the legislation further delimits their rights. It is a very sad day, indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister was about to embark on a few arguments but he had to beat a hasty retreat because it was obvious that he was not going anywhere with regard to to whom these measures would be applicable. It is quite transparent that the only reason the measures are being introduced is to deal with people who are seeking asylum. The Minister was about to try to justify the legislation on the basis that a few alleged crooks from other countries would come before the courts every year. He said that because the legislation applied to them it is fine and it should apply to innocent asylum seekers also. Even the Minister was beginning to become embarrassed by his own argument so he did not push any further.</P>
    <P>It is simply and wholly to do with delimiting the rights of asylum seekers. The latest provision which cuts off access to the Supreme Court is an appalling precedent to introduce to our laws. The subsection states that leave for appeal:</P>
    <P>shall only be granted where the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>However, what about the individual rights of human beings before the courts? That is what is being openly attacked by the Government in this measure. It is quite shameful. It is incredible that the Minister is in effect prejudging the cases of many of those who will go before the courts to seek judicial review of his decisions. He said that these measures are necessary to prevent people lengthening the process unduly or using the judicial review process when they have no case. Who says they have no case? The presumption in every case that goes before a High Court judge is that the person concerned has a case and must be given a full hearing. This is the presumption on which the Minister, representing the State, should work.</P>
    <P>The statistics quoted by the Minister regarding the outcome of judicial review applications already heard or in the process of being heard demonstrate that the applications were not trivial or tenuous. I gave the wrong figure when I mentioned 30 cases, but the point is clear when it is analysed that in many cases there were substantial grounds for applications for judicial review. Therefore, it is spurious to try to use the excuse that trivial, tenuous or vexatious reasons will be used.</P>
    <P>Given that the time to make a substantial case for judicial review is being delimited to 14 days, the extra measure of refusing applications to the Supreme Court compounds the injustice. As it is delimited to 14 days, it is entirely possible that applicants will not be in a position to have the <Col N="912" /> best case possible put forward. As they will not have recourse to the Supreme Court, the Minister has compounded the injustice in this area. When one considers the particular complications and complexities faxing people seeking asylum in Ireland, who are generally very poor, one can understand the difficulties. There are often severe language problems and undoubtedly there will be major problems with legal aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister pretended that legal aid can be provided at the drop of a hat. However, given the language and logistical difficulties and the resources available, it is disingenuous of him to pretend that unfortunate asylum seekers can have solicitors and barristers to hand as if they were millionaires in a position to directly buy their services. That is manifestly not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take his direction from the necessity to protect human rights and the preservation of natural justice and people's right to seek asylum and refuge. He should do everything possible to ensure that no mistake is made. If a mistake is made and a person is forcibly deported to the wrong country, he or she could end up in prison or be killed. We are talking about people's lives and an understanding of the gravity of the human need in this area should dictate the policy of the State, not the rantings of Neanderthal politicians who occasionally, in order to consolidate a very narrow base of support, make outrageous racist statements targeting asylum seekers and minorities, people of a different colour and culture to the majority on this island. The State, the Minister and the Government should not take their lead from politicians whose ideas are from the caves. They should take it from the best practice and philosophy that obtains with regard to the preservation of human rights, human dignity and the right of people to have their rights vindicated in the same way as citizens of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The restriction on the right of appeal to the Supreme Court is one of the most outrageous provisions of the Bill. To my knowledge, it is the first time a Minister has tried to curtail the right of appeal in any area other than the technical and administrative sphere. My view is that the Supreme Court must be able to deal with basic constitutional and human rights. It must be able to deal with non-nationals in exactly the same way as it deals with nationals. For those reasons, the proposal is probably unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage similar to the amendments tabled by Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy Jim Higgins. The purpose of the amendment was to delete the section. I tried to give the Minister some scope to reflect by varying the tack on Report Stage so my amendments Nos. 20 and 21 are new. I am suggesting a more limited amendment than deleting the Minister's proposal. This amendment would allow the <Col N="913" /> Supreme Court to give a certificate of leave to appeal. I understand this happens in a criminal case. If one is convicted in the Circuit Court, one asks the judge there for leave to appeal. If the judge refuses, one can ask the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave to appeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reflect on this half way measure. It would allow a person the right to seek the right to appeal in the Supreme Court. It is most important to leave with the Supreme Court the final right on whether it should hear an appeal. Otherwise, if the Minister's proposal stands, the High Court will be the sole judge in the matter. I do not believe this is appropriate in a personal liberty matter.</P>
    <P>I tried to find a formula that might meet the Minister's requirements, which are simple although he will try to dress them up. He wants the quickest provision and he does not want people utilising mechanisms to prolong their stay in Ireland if a decision has been made. It can be argued that decisions other than those relating to deportation can be reviewed, but that is the kernel of the matter. However, a more fundamental issue is at stake and this is the way the courts are treated. In matters relating to personal liberty and rights, the Supreme Court has made an extraordinarily valuable contribution to the development of the corpus of law and rights in Ireland. We should not seek to delimit access to that jurisprudence to any non-national simply because of their category as non-nationals and because they fall within the remit of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My amendments are sensible. They do not go as far as the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage, which has been restated eloquently and well by Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Joe Higgins. However, they allow due recognition to the Supreme Court and would allow it to determine whether it should hear an appeal. I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to reflect on this matter and that he will not dismiss them out of hand. As he has conceded little in this debate to date, I hope he will see some merit in my argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 would remove subsection (3), the provision which confines appeal to the Supreme Court only on a point of law, and amendment No. 19 which would substantially amend it and in such a way as to effectively nullify the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) confines the right of appeal from the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court, in judicial review of immigration and asylum matters, to cases where the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that an appeal to the Supreme Court would be desirable in the public interest. The provision applies to decisions of the High Court to grant or refuse leave to apply for judicial review, which would arise at the earliest stage of the judicial review process, and also to <Col N="914" /> decisions of the High Court on the merits or otherwise of the judicial review application.</P>
    <P>Let us look closely at the terms used in the subsection and their precise application to the cases in question. Let us look at the situation of a person liable to be deported who goes to the High Court claiming that the procedure leading to the deportation order was flawed in some respect. In order to get past first base, the potential deportee must show the High Court that there are substantial grounds for this assertion. Because the application is not <i>ex parte</i>, the Minister is in a position to put counter arguments and factual clarification before the court.</P>
    <P>The court, having heard both sides on the preliminary issue, should have a good basis for its decision, whichever way that goes. If the court decides there is a substantial ground for arguing that the deportation procedure was flawed, the Minister, if he is not happy with that decision, can seek leave to appeal it to the Supreme Court. This subsection states in those circumstances that in order to be given leave to make such an appeal, the Minister must persuade the court that its decision involved a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that the appeal be heard. Similarly, if the High Court has refused the application for leave to seek judicial review, it would be for the applicant to demonstrate to the court that these two conditions were met in order to be allowed to appeal. In circumstances where the High Court has had the opportunity of hearing both sides of the issue, that is a perfectly reasonable restriction on the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>Let us also consider this subsection as it will apply following substantive consideration of the judicial review. The High Court will have arrived at a decision following full exposition of the facts of the deportation process as applied to the particular case, including all documentation. It will have heard both sides of any dispute on the facts of the procedure followed in the case and it will have heard detailed legal arguments on the issue of whether there was a flaw in the procedure as applied to the person in question. If, after all that, the Minister or the person in question is dissatisfied with the High Court's decision, it is not unreasonable that it should be for the Minister or the person seeking to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court to show the High Court there is a point of law of exceptional public importance and that an appeal would be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The constitutional position is clear. By Article 34.4.3º the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction from the High Court is &ldquo;with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;, and this subsection is such an exception or regulation. The protection under Article 34.4.4º for appeals involving constitutional issues is reflected in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the section. The appeal provision in subsection (3) is of a piece with the intent generally of this provision to ensure, consistent with the interests of justice, that the pursuit of court proceedings will not <Col N="915" /> unnecessarily delay the processing of cases in the immigration and asylum areas and that the interests of the public generally will be served by its retention in this section.</P>
    <P>The approach of Deputy Howlin's amendments is different. It is clear from the thrust of his amendments that he accepts the principle that the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in judicial reviews and applications for judicial review in immigration and asylum cases should be confined to those cases where a point of law of exceptional public importance is involved and that it is in the public interest that the appeal should be heard by the Supreme Court. The Deputy's amendments seek to spell out that the refusal by the High Court to certify that a particular case falls into that category should itself be appealable. I am advised this is implicit from subsection (3) as it stands and Article 34.4.3º and that the amendments are unnecessary. I assure the Deputy that the aim which he seeks to achieve with these amendments is already achieved by the language of the subsection. Deputy Howlin might wish to withdraw his amendments on that basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins referred to asylum seekers and refugees as if these were coterminous concepts or terms. They are not. There is a deep difference between an asylum seeker and a refugee. If that was not the case, there would not have been a need for the 1951 Geneva Convention. Just because one applies for an old age pension, for example, it does not mean one should be given it. If I applied for an old age pension, I would not be granted it on the basis of my birth certificate because I am not the appropriate age.</P>

Why should the Minister not have the same rights on behalf of the people as the applicant? I see no reason why he or she should not have the same rights. Anything else is ridiculous and tips the scales in one direction or the other.</P>
      <P>As regards criminalising asylum seekers, nothing could be further from the truth. There is nothing here which criminalises or stigmatises asylum seekers. I am applying common sense to this entire concept. I know a refugee is a person who is fleeing persecution or death and I know it does not cover a person who is an illegal immigrant. We cannot use the same terminology in respect of an illegal immigrant and a refugee.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be of greater import to refugees than that the definition which applies to them in international law would be observed by states. It is of considerable importance in the light of conflicts which have taken place throughout the world that human beings who are fleeing persecution or death receive sanctuary. It is an acknowledged fact by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that there is no greater cause of delay in the cases of applicants for refugee status than illegal immigrants clogging up the system. It is important that the language and terminology used are correct not least to those people who are refugees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin accused me of delivering homilies. I suppose I could accuse him of sermonising. While I have listened to many homilies, I have delivered none. I accept I have had to deliver some responsorial psalms during this debate, but that was not my fault.</P>
      <P>I am not seeking to delimit the rights of asylum seekers.</P>

The courts will decide whether the individual has a substantial ground to make that case and if he or she has a substantial ground, then obviously it will go to a full hearing and if the court decides otherwise, obviously it will not go to a full hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the idea that there is a presumption that people have a case, I am afraid there is no presumption about people having a case in our courts.

In a criminal case the prosecution must prove that its case is established beyond a reasonable doubt. There are no presumptions like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins is concerned that in the event of people being deported, and as a result of these measures, people could end up &ldquo;in prison or dead in a foreign country&rdquo; but he must not have heard of the rule against <i>refoulement</i>, a principle which has been enunciated in refugee law here and internationally. It simply means that an individual cannot be deported to a country where he or she might face persecution or death. That is the safeguard. That is the way it is and no amount of assertions to the contrary can deny that basic fact. I have put the case as well as I can and I think it is fair, balanced and reasonable. I have thought that from the beginning.</P>

The right of appeal to the various levels of the courts is fundamental and this subsection is putting another obstacle to the right of access to people from outside the jurisdiction to have their cases heard. To say it is adequate to expect the High Court to overturn its own decision &ndash; that is what the Minister is effectively saying here &ndash; and then set down exceptional public importance as the guiding principle, is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Geneva Convention we have given people the right to seek refugee status in countries when they are fleeing from degrading and inhuman treatment, yet we are now subjecting them to almost equally degrading and inhuman treatment by depriving them of the fundamental human right to have access to the courts to have their cases heard from the bottom to the top level. If the final decision is that they should be deported, so be it, but what the Minister is doing is most unfair. As we warned him earlier, in seeking to graft on to the Bill two fundamental <Col N="919" /> changes on Committee and Report Stages, the Minister is defeating the whole thrust of what started out as a worthwhile project but which will die a death. As a result, there will not even be the limited protection that currently exists for people coming into the country in containers. The sad reality is that, as Deputy Howlin has warned, we could have another Dover in any of our sea ports over a humid summer period.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The reason this is an attack on human rights by the Government is because it puts poor people and vulnerable people at a disadvantage compared to people and institutions that are far more powerful in Irish society. If a major bank and a large business enterprise were at each other's throats before the High Court in a dispute over filthy lucre &ndash; grubby fingers in the cash till &ndash; would the Minister come in here to try to stop whoever loses the case going to the Supreme Court? That is what he is doing on behalf of people who do not have that economic or legal clout, people who are in an extremely vulnerable position. The Minister's argument is that this is intended to streamline procedures. If it streamlines procedures for poor people who are seeking refuge in this country, then it will streamline them for all institutions including bankers, big business, multinational companies and all the others who can buy their <Col N="920" /> way through the Supreme Court, the High Court and every court in the land, and spend months and years doing it as long as they can come up with the money, which they invariably can do. Poor people, however, who are displaced from their countries do not have such clout or money yet the Minister is severely limiting their access to the courts and their appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest court according to our legal system, and he tells us that is not an attack on human rights. It is an attack on human rights; any ordinary person knows that.</P>
      <P>I have no confidence in the safety guaranteed by the Minister for people who will be sent back to extremely repressive regimes. We will have tragedies if the Minister has his way because people will be sent back to countries where they will be severely abused, incarcerated and perhaps even killed. Unfortunately we might not hear about it but that is the responsibility the Minister carries for bringing in this type of an attack on human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused and worried as are many people in Cork as to what is happening in regard to the promised £61 million expansion package for Cork Airport that should have started. On the one hand I have a positive response from the Minister to a parliamentary question today which states:</P>
      <P>I am aware that Aer Rianta has proposed expenditure of up to £60 million at Cork Airport over the next five years, on a variety of airfield, terminal and ancillary projects. I understand that the company has every intention of completing that expenditure programme.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I have a cutting from Monday's <i>Irish Independent</i> which has a headline &ldquo;Anger as £61 million plan for Cork is axed by Aer Rianta&rdquo;. The article states, &ldquo;The bid has now collapsed and Aer Rianta is shelving the £61 million development plan on the basis that it cannot afford it&rdquo;. I am informed that the chairperson of Aer Rianta, Mr. Noel Hanlon, came to Cork recently and while speaking to staff at the airport indicated that without an IPO the capital expenditure programme planned for Cork could not be funded and, therefore, could not go ahead. Will the Minister explain how she, as the largest shareholder in the company, is saying one thing while the chairperson has clearly indicated something else to the staff in Cork?</P>
      <P>Last September Aer Rianta announced a massive commitment to Cork Airport. At the time the commitment was not reliant on an IPO. I was present at the press statement. Am I correct in saying it is still the Government's position that if there is not Cabinet agreement on the IPO, the Minister will not provide capital funding to allow the essential development to take place in Cork?</P>
      <P>Cork Airport has a throughput of 1.5 million passengers annually. We face the prospect of having to deal with an estimated 2.5 million passengers by 2004 in an airport designed for less than half that number. I am in favour of investing State funds in capital projects that will ensure positive infrastructural development in transport. In this regard I do not see funding capital projects in airports to allow growth in passenger numbers as any different from investing in rail or road networks to allow for increased traffic.</P>
      <P>Cork Airport is close to turning away extra business because future investment is uncertain. I ask the Minister to make a clear and unambiguous statement on the promised development of Cork Airport. This is not about investing in a company but about investing in a central regional infrastructure in the south. I am pleased a Minister for Cork is present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Coveney, for allowing me to share time. I will probably reiterate some of his comments regarding the future of Cork Airport. Future development in that airport is uncertain. Last September we were invited to a presentation by the chairman of Aer Rianta of his intentions for Cork Airport which involved investment of over £61 million. I have raised the issue on an Adjournment Debate previously. The Minister for Public Enterprise has said the funding will go ahead. She also said it was a matter for Aer Rianta and that the Government will not provide the funding. We in Cork are confused. The workers at the airport and the general public in Cork are concerned. <Col N="923" /> Passenger numbers have increased in the first four months of this year and are 20% up on the same time last year. The airport has reached its capacity and is in need of development. The future development of the Cork region depends on the development of the airport. There have been numerous rumours about splits in Cabinet, the IPO, that Cork Airport will be sold separately, that Shannon Airport will be sold separately. That is not acceptable to the people of Cork who want Cork Airport retained under the umbrella of Aer Rianta. We seek answers and clarification with regard to the Government's commitment to the future of Cork Airport.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney and Deputy Clune for raising this important matter. I wish there was an airport in my constituency for which I could fight.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Aer Rianta has proposed expenditure of up to £60 million at Cork Airport over the next five years on a variety of airfield, terminal and ancillary projects. She understands that the company has every intention of completing that expenditure programme. There is ongoing investment at the airport with £6 million having been spent in 1999 on the overlay of the runway. Projects such as apron extensions and taxiway improvements, at a total cost of £8 million, are about to go to tender. They will commence as soon as possible and will take approximately 18 months to complete.</P>
      <P>Plans are currently being finalised for an extensive upgrading of the roads and public car parks, including a multi-storey car park for which planning permission has already been obtained from Cork County Council, and other infrastructure such as upgrading of the water supply, drainage and sewerage facilities. The estimated cost of these infrastructural developments is £15 million and it is hoped that work on these projects will commence before year end.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta also has plans to double the capacity of the existing terminal building, which is estimated to cost £30 million, planning for which has already commenced. Work is expected to commence on this project in 2001. In addition to these airport development projects, work has also commenced on the construction of the new Great Southern Hotel at Cork Airport, costing £7 million. This is scheduled to open in March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Minister will maintain an ongoing review of the capital programme at each of the State airports in the light of developments in traffic growth and Aer Rianta's future funding requirements and capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the delay in the commencement of the one-stop shop in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, which was approved by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on 28 May 1999. Sligo County Council made a good submission to the Department.</P>
      <P>I was delighted with the Minister's announcement of this project last year. I had pursued the project with him for some time and I was particularly pleased that he sanctioned it. The provision of a one-stop shop in Tubbercurry will be of great benefit not only to the town but also to the region of south Sligo which I represent. The area is sparsely populated. Within a seven mile radius of the town there is a population of 14,000 people, of whom 1,800 reside in Tubbercurry.</P>
      <P>The local authority services to be provided include a branch library, which will be one of the most modern in the country, and a planning office to which people will be able to apply for planning permissions. At present, there are between 300 and 400 applications for planning permission in the Tubbercurry area as a result of rural renewal. There will be a housing loans service. It will also be possible to come to the one-stop shop in Tubbercurry from any town in the surrounding area to tax one's car. Other services to be located there will include the Revenue Commissioners, general purposes administration, grants, licences, special projects offices, Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the National Social Services Board, the North Western Health Board which will have two floors in the building, FÁS, Sligo County Enterprise Board, Leader and North West Tourism. Members will be aware that the area is renowned for its tourism industry.</P>
      <P>This amounts to a mini decentralisation of local government and Departments. A total of 13 months have elapsed since the project was approved by the Minister. A design team has been in place for some time. What is causing the delay with the project? Why is it not progressing? Construction was due to have started in the first half of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirteen county councils have been approved by the Department for one-stop shops and I am delighted that Sligo County Council and the Minister chose Tubbercurry. I am anxious that this project should proceed as soon as possible. This year at least four more one-stop shops will be up and running. When the shop in Tubbercurry is opened it will enhance Tubbercurry, particularly Humbert Street where it will be built. At present, there is a number of derelict buildings <Col N="925" /> on the street and I look forward to construction starting.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that this facility be up and running as soon as possible. I have put a great deal of work into it. When the Taoiseach visited Sligo and Tubbercurry I arranged for a deputation and the Tubbercurry chamber of commerce to meet him and we put the case for the one-stop shop. It was approved 13 months ago and I hope it will not be long before it is operational.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this matter and I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
      <P>I first wish to clarify that no ministerial approval was necessary for the Tubbercurry one-stop shop project. This is a Sligo County Council project which was duly approved by the elected members on foot of a project proposal from the manager. The Minister did, however, approve total funding of £350,000 for the project under the national one-stop shop initiative and the Deputy was informed accordingly on 31 May 1999. This amount was allocated over a two year period &ndash; £100,000 in 1999 and £250,000 in 2000.</P>
      <P>Due to the initial delays in the project, the council did not expend sufficient moneys to draw down the 1999 allocation. However, the Minister has brought forward the amount to 2000 so the full allocation is available to the council this year. Incidentally, this funding represents approximately 27% of the total project costs.</P>
      <P>The reason for the delays in the project to date is that the council has had some difficulty acquiring a number of properties on Humbert Street, the site for the centre. The acquisitions are by way of a combination of compulsory purchase and negotiation. I understand that the difficulties have now been largely overcome. Full title for six properties on which the centre is to be located has now passed to the council. Separate processes are under way to acquire a seventh property, which will provide a second access to the centre, and for the acquisition of portions of rear gardens to allow for ample car parking. These will not impede the start of the development process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The centre has been redesigned to provide a second floor, giving additional capacity. The council will put a model of the centre on display in early July to coincide with the start of the planning process. On this basis, it is expected that site work will start towards the end of the year with the centre becoming operational towards the end of 2001. As well as the full range of council services, including a branch library and motor tax, the one-stop-shop will provide various levels of service from other public service agencies and bodies. These include the North Western Health Board, social welfare services, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Coillte, money advice and budgeting services, Revenue, North West Tourism, Marketing Sligo Forum, court services, North West Regional Fish<Col N="926" /> eries, LEADER and local development and VEC and educational services.</P>
    <P>Tubbercurry one-stop-shop will be a useful and vibrant facility for the people of the town and surrounding areas. The council is fully committed to getting it up and running as soon as possible and it will continue to get the Minister's support in bringing public services closer to the communities they serve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of reasons for raising this matter on the Adjournment. A number of weeks ago I attended a funeral in the northern part of my constituency. Recently I met a son of the woman who died who thanked me for attending the funeral. As well as the death of his mother, what upset him most was the fact that he had an elder brother who went to England over 40 years ago and could not be contacted when his mother died. The woman who was elderly died suddenly and the family made every effort to contact their brother. Last year, I was involved with Mayo County Council in relation to the case of a woman living in Camden Town who was dying from cancer. The woman's sister lived in another part of County Mayo and I made every effort to bring that woman back to Mayo. We found it very difficult to obtain accommodation for the woman and eventually her sister took her. She was here only four weeks when she died.</P>
      <P>Approximately one year ago I was speaking to a garda who asked me about a family in a certain part of my town. The Garda Síochána received a phone call about a woman who was dying in a hospital in England. This woman had not been home to Ireland for over 60 years. At the time there was some dispute at home with her parents after which she left and never returned to this country. Within 24 hours of her family being notified they were at her dying bed in England. Over the years the family tried to make contact with her but did not know how to go about it. They did not know who could assist them.</P>
      <P>Recently Mr. John Neary came to my clinic in Castlebar. He is now trying to set up some kind of agency whereby he could contact people's relatives in Britain. However, if this man is to set up a semi-voluntary agency he should be entitled to grant aid for equipment, advertising and so on. It is a reasonable request from this man who is prepared to set up this agency. I am sure other voluntary organisations are prepared to do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that Irish people are the largest ethnic group in Britain with the highest death rate. Most Irish emigrants who left in the thirties and forties lived in rented accommodation and worked hard to send home money. When this State was sinking in the 1930s and 1940s, what kept it alive, particularly the west, was the pound sterling coming from Britain. Many people forget this nowadays. These people who worked in menial jobs in hotels and on build<Col N="927" /> ing sites did not think about when they would not be able to work. They did not think about their pensions or what would happen to them when they got older. Many of them can now be found in cardboard cities throughout Britain. These people are being buried by the State in Britain even though their families here would be pleased to assist them if they knew how to contact them.</P>
    <P>Given that our economy is doing so well, we owe it to these people who helped their families and who may be ashamed to say they did not make it, to do something for them. In every walk of life not everyone makes it. There will always be those who worked abroad and did not make it. These are the people we should target and bring home to many parts of rural Ireland. We should try to get them into nice accommodation they can afford in the last years of their lives where they will have friends to assist them. If they have no family to help them, at least we should look after our own because they did a good job for us when they were able to work.</P>
    <P>I intend to put down a question to the Minister for Finance in the coming weeks in relation to what English pensions are now coming into the country. In many parts of my constituency more English pensions than Irish pensions are being paid to people who worked abroad. Now that times are good, I ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs not to forget those who left this country and perhaps did not do so well. We should not be ashamed to assist them and bring home to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with Deputy Ring because I was one of those people who went to that part of north-west London. I and many like me were lucky during the good times in the sixties to be able to return to this country. However, as the Deputy has said, many people were not able to do so. I recall doing an exercise on the Irish abroad as a sub-group of the British/Irish Parliamentary Body, together with Deputy Spring and members of the Deputy's party. We met with representative groups in London and came across some horrific discoveries. Therefore, I can empathise with what the Deputy said.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this motion on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who is unable to be here this evening. I thank Deputy Ring for raising this important issue affecting older Irish people who may wish to return to their native surroundings after many years spent working and living abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific target group referred to by the Deputy concerns elderly Irish people living abroad who wish to return home and who may need assistance to do so. As part of the social welfare package in Budget 2000, the Minister announced a special fund of £100,000 to provide this year for the development of emigrant infor<Col N="928" /> mation and advice services. The primary purpose of this measure is to identify and respond to the information needs of Irish people living abroad and to improve access to pre-departure advice for those who may wish to go abroad. The Minister would be prepared to consider applications for funding from organisations involved in the provision of information to Irish people, including older people, who are considering returning to Ireland after periods spent working and living abroad.</P>
    <P>An issue of major importance to older people is pensions. The primary role of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is the provision of a broad range of income and other supports to individuals, families and communities. Generally speaking, those services apply to people living in this country or those living abroad who, by working in this country for certain periods, have established entitlement to transferable pensions and benefits under EU regulations or by virtue of the various international bilateral agreements currently in force.</P>
    <P>It is normally the responsibility of the host country, that is, the country of residence or country of last employment, to provide pensions, benefits and other relevant social services. Both EU regulations and the bilateral agreements include provisions for the protection and maintenance of pension rights for people who move from one country to another. Full information in this regard, including any necessary documentation, can be obtained prior to departure from the relevant administrative authorities or, indeed, from any office of the Department on arrival in this country.</P>
    <P>The Government has already announced its intention of establishing a task force, to be chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and comprising social partners and other relevant interests, to develop a coherent long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs. This task force will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the role of both the statutory and voluntary organisations in meeting the needs of emigrants and, in particular, the needs of vulnerable groups, and bring forward recommendations for a long-term coherent policy in this regard. This can include a review of the current mechanism for supporting organisations working with Irish communities both at home and abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. The Minister, through you, will note that my request refers to the entitlement to carer's allowance for those in receipt of retirement contributory pensions. I recently had a case where this issue came to light. It is outrageous that someone who has contributed through the State for over 40 years to a retirement pension cannot receive two social welfare payments. A contributory pension belongs to the person who <Col N="929" /> paid for it. Someone receiving the same amount of money from a private pension qualifies for a carer's allowance. It is outrageous that someone who gives money to the State to protect his or her interests on retirement cannot get their rights in terms of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Upon reaching retirement age, a person rightly receives a retirement pension. If that person decides to work somewhere, he retains his contributory pension. That proves that it is not a benefit. It is a pension to which he has contributed and to which he is entitled. If he wants to work by looking after an elderly relative, which is work in itself, the State says he cannot have his pension or else he will have to forego the carer's allowance. That does not make sense. I would understand if a person was receiving a non-contributory pension. In those circumstances the point could be argued that they are in receipt a social welfare payment but not when the pension in question is contributory.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is not here because the example I will give relates to a couple living in his constituency. I received the complaint through a solicitor in my constituency who feels very strongly about this. The couple in question are both over 70 years of age and the lady is looking after her deaf and dumb cousin. There is no one else to look after him. They applied and received notification from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs telling them that they qualified for a carer's allowance at the rate of £75.70 per week from Thursday 23 April 1999. The letter informed them, however, that they were in receipt of retirement pension at the weekly rate of £83 and that they could not get a carer's allowance while they were in receipt of a retirement pension.</P>
      <P>I have laid out the arguments as to why people should qualify but this lady is working on behalf of the State. She is looking after a deaf and dumb cousin who is over 70 years of age. If she was not doing that, he would be in a home for which the State would have to pay considerably more than the miserly sum we would give her for looking after this cousin.</P>
      <P>The income limit to qualify for a carer's allowance at that time was £6,000 and the retirement pension is well below that figure. The only thing stopping that lady from getting the carer's allowance is this argument that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister regard a contributory retirement pension as a social welfare benefit. It is not a social welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>I am asking, therefore, that those in receipt of contributory pensions who go through all the due processes and are told by the Department, as this person was, that they qualify for a carer's allowance should get it. If this continues the State will face a much higher bill for someone who has to go into a home because he or she cannot be cared for within the family set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> It is time this was sorted out. I tabled a parliamentary question and received the standard reply. There was a ray of hope in the reply that the Department was examining the matter and there was a possibility that a new payment could be introduced. I hope the Minister will confirm in his reply that people similar to the couple I described will get what they are entitled to from the State and we will recognise that people who contribute for more than 40 years to a fund for a pension from the State are entitled to other benefits. If I retire at 65 and draw my pension, I can take up another job and retain that pension, so why do I not get the carer's allowance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for raising this important issue. All of us come across such cases in our constituencies.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the carer's allowance is to provide a means-tested income support payment to those who are caring full-time and who are on low incomes.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and was published in October 1998. Arising from this review, Deputy Dermot Ahern introduced major improvements to the carer's allowance scheme in the 1999 and 2000 Budgets.</P>
      <P>At the end of May 2000, there were 15,380 carer's allowances in payment. When this Government came to office three years ago, there were approximately 9,500 people in receipt of carer's allowance. This represents an increase of more than 60% in the number of carers claiming the allowance during that period. Again, when this Government came to office in 1997, expenditure on carer's allowance was £36.5 million and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. The review of the carer's allowance examined the question of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. It noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. As indicated, the practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual.</P>
      <P>The review concluded that this practice should continue. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a non-means tested &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envis<Col N="931" /> aged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children. The Western Health Board agreed to undertake this pilot project in its area and that the results of this study will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government also pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities is to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development by the State, in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs.</P>
    <P>To this end, one of the remaining proposals arising from the review of the carer's allowance will be examined this year. A consultancy study <Col N="932" /> will be undertaken to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, also announced in Budget 2000 the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme which recognises that leaving employment to provide care is a contingency broadly similar to other contingencies under the social insurance code and, as such, the benefit will fill a gap in the social insurance system. The new carer's benefit scheme, which will be of 15 months duration, is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>The scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by the Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. The carer's benefit scheme will come into effect from October.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the Government's key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of the action programme. The Deputy's salient point was that a contributory pension should not be deemed to be a social welfare payment. I will bring that point to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 June 2000.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob): I have no funds with which to provide direct financial assistance to householders for radon remediation measures in the current year. While I can give no commitment about a grant scheme at present, I am keeping this matter under continuous review.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of radon problems throughout the country and in highlighting public awareness of radon. Along with the RPII, I have encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas and who have not had their homes measured for radon levels to contact the RPII with a view to having radon levels assessed.</P>
    <P>I will continue to take an active role in monitoring progress on dealing with the radon problem in households and in encouraging the RPII in its public awareness campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airports' policy. Over recent years, both the Minister for Defence and I have received several proposals in relation to limited development of civil aviation at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>The position of Baldonnel was considered in the Warburg Dillon Read/AIB report on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction, which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that, with regard to Baldonnel, the advisers see no reason for the Government to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approvals. They believe, <Col N="934" /> however, that while the development of a corporate jet facility on a commercial basis could be viable, a larger scale passenger airport development at Baldonnel would be commercially challenging.</P>
    <P>These issues are addressed in the advisers' report which is now publicly available. I am now giving careful consideration to the findings and recommendations of that report and I will submit my proposals for consideration by the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>As military aerodromes are excluded from the provisions of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, the IAA are unable to exercise jurisdiction over civil aviation activities at the aerodrome until such time as a legislative amendment is introduced.</P>
    <P>Proposals to amend Section 3 of the IAA Act, 1993, to enable the IAA to regulate the safety aspects of civil aviation operations at military aerodromes are being included in the Aviation Regulation Bill which is at present before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Aer Rianta has proposed expenditure of up to £60 million at Cork Airport over the next five years, on a variety of airfield, terminal and ancillary projects. I understand that the company has every intention of completing that expenditure programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> There is ongoing investment at the airport, with £6 million having been spent in 1999 on the overlay of the runway. Projects such as apron extensions and taxiway improvements, at a total cost of £8 million, are about to go to tender. They will commence as soon as possible and will take approximately 18 months to complete.</P>
    <P>Plans are currently being finalised for an extensive upgrading of the roads, public car parks, including a multi-storey car park for which planning permission has already been obtained from Cork County Council, and other infrastructure such as upgrading of the water supply, drainage and sewerage facilities. The estimated cost of these infrastructural developments is £15 million and it is hoped that work on these projects will commence before year end.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta also have plans to double the capacity of the existing terminal building, which is estimated to cost £30 million, planning for which has already commenced. Work is expected to commence on this project in 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition to these airport development projects, work has also commenced on the construction of the new Great Southern Hotel at Cork Airport, costing £7 million. This is scheduled to open in March 2001.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta funds its capital development programme at each of the three State airports from its own resources and borrowings. I will maintain an ongoing review of the capital programme at each of the State airports in the light of developments in traffic growth and Aer Rianta's future funding requirements and capacity.</P>
    <P>As regards the management-staff constructive participation programme, the participation process in Aer Rianta is voluntary and there have been varying degrees of involvement by different groups at all locations. Cork Airport operates in a participative climate regardless of any formal structure and, against that background, communications between management and staff continue to receive a high priority.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future of the State airports, including Cork Airport, as the Deputy is aware, I have already submitted the Warburg Dillon Read report on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta to my Cabinet colleagues and also made it publicly available. I intend to bring specific recommendations to Government in this regard as soon as possible. No decision on future plans for any of the three State airports, including Cork Airport, will be taken in advance of that.</P>

      <P>Assuming that the Corrib <Col N="936" /> field will be declared commercial, the gas will have to be piped to where the gas market exists, mainly on the east coast. It has to flow through a significant segment of the west of Ireland for that to happen. In that scenario it is reasonable to assume that gas service will be provided to towns and industries along the way wherever it is economic to do so. Detailed decision making in this respect will be for BGE and other market players.</P>

      <P>A draft of the report has been received by my Department in the last few days. The consultants examined a number of railway options and concluded that there were good opportunities for developing the rail network alongside a supportive land use development policy.</P>
      <P>While most of the options considered would not be financially viable the consultants took into account the wider social and environmental issues which arise. When these are factored in, a case can be made for the development of new stations and services and the re-opening of the Midleton line. However, the scope for such developments is critically dependent on the appropriate land use strategies being brought forward for the areas adjacent to the rail corridors.</P>
      <P>In this context the Deputy will be aware that both Cork Corporation and Cork County Council are engaged in developing the Cork Strategic Plan 2000-2020. I would expect that the rail study will be fully taken into account in the formulation of this plan.</P>

      <P>Following full liberalisation of the telecommunications market in December 1998, competition has been developing with the sector, with consequential benefits for Irish consumers and business. In addition to the traditional fixed line telephone network a number of new platforms, such as digital cable, MMDS and wireless in the local loop will provide customers with alternative sources of access to telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>There has been much recent debate concerning the local loop. On 19 April 2000 the Director of Telecommunications Regulation announced a decision mandating the introduction of bitstream access to the local loop and laying out a framework for the introduction of local loop unbundling in Ireland. On 26 April 2000 the European Commission issued a recommendation on unbundled access to the local loop. I will be introducing legislation to address competitive access to the local loop in the context of a new regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am advised that bitstream access as proposed by the Director of Telecoms Regulation does not require legislation. However, full local loop unbundling requires primary legislation.</P>
      <P>In the coming weeks my Department will be consulting with interested parties on the proposed legislation. Following this, I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government later this year.</P>

      <P>The paper which I put forward to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships proposed to increase private participation in the provision of bus services in the greater Dublin area in two ways. Bus Átha Cliath will be encouraged to subcontract more of its services to private operators. Subsequent to the presentation of my paper, the company obtained trade union agreement to do this. Subcontracting will allow private operators to gain some limited operational experience in the Dublin bus market, without the wider financial risks attendant on full franchising.</P>
      <P>Private bus operators will be granted licences to operate services on certain routes in the greater Dublin area under the provisions of the existing Road Transport Act, 1932. The first step will be to complete the consideration of existing licensing applications for routes in the greater Dublin area. Subsequently the guidelines for the consideration of licence applications will be reviewed and a licensing round of specified duration will be announced during which applications for licences which accord with the revised guidelines may be submitted.</P>
      <P>Within a year it is proposed to draft and enact legislation to establish a shadow bus regulatory body for the greater Dublin area. The principal functions of this body will be to make the necessary preparations for the phased implementation of a fully franchised bus market and the authority will have the power to enter into public service contracts with the CIE companies, thus dealing with the legal problem that currently prevents me from entering into such contracts.</P>

      <P>The process leading to the finalisation of the public transport elements of the national development plan entailed a detailed analysis of public transport investment needs by my Department in consultation with the Dublin Transportation Office and CIE and its operating subsidiaries. The Dublin Transportation Office published its Transportation Blueprint 2000 to 2006, while CIE prepared a series of investment reviews covering mainline rail, suburban rail, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and rail freight.</P>
      <P>The result was seen in the national plan which provided for an unprecedented level of investment in public transport in the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>This amounts to more than £2.2 billion and can be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>Greater Dublin Area &ndash; Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow £1.6 billion; mainline rail £500 million; other regional public transport £150 million.</P>
      <P>However, the evaluation of transport requirements is an ongoing process. There are currently a number of studies under way which focus principally on longer-term requirements.</P>
      <P>The DTO is currently working on finalising an updated transportation strategy for the period 2000-2016. This work takes account of the findings of the bus network review and the suburban strategic rail study, both of which were commissioned by CIE.</P>
      <P>When the Government has considered the DTO recommendations, it will then be in a position to decide on an updated longer-term transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities and public transport bodies in both the Cork and Limerick regions have commissioned consultants to undertake planning, land use and transportation studies. These are currently under way and my Department is actively involved with both studies. A similar <Col N="942" /> study has recently been completed in Galway. These studies will bring forward public transport proposals for these areas. I will be favourably disposed to supporting these proposals, where they are fully integrated with coherent land use development strategies and where they provide for the implementation of effective traffic management and bus priority measures.</P>

      <P>I have said on several occasions that questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis in the context of developments in their main business areas.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the commercial State companies under my aegis is as follows: the process leading to an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus is under way. In this regard, the Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, to provide the legal framework to enable the IPO to proceed was published on 14 June last. Depending on market conditions and the satisfactory finalisation of all preparatory stages for the IPO, it may be possible to complete the offering in the latter half of 2000 or early 2001.</P>
      <P>In regard to the CIE group of companies, the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships recently accepted in principle my proposals that consideration will be given to the transfer to private ownership of either Bus Átha Cliath or Bus Éireann within three years, most likely Bus Átha Cliath, as a key element of the introduction of competition into the Dublin bus market; consideration be given to the possible privatisation of the second bus company at a future date; and Iarnród Éireann be split into separate operating and infrastructure companies and that consideration be given in the future to privatising the operating company. I plan to bring those proposals to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>There are currently no plans to privatise ESB. I have asked the board to review its future options to meet the challenges and exploit the opportunities provided by competition in the liberalised electricity market, including ownership, alliances and strategic partnerships. I expect the board to report to me in the autumn.</P>
      <P>In relation to Aer Rianta, I am continuing to give detailed and careful consideration to the findings of the Warburg Dillon Read-AIB report on the future strategic direction of the company with a view to bringing specific recommendations to Government in this regard as soon as possible. It would not be appropriate to speculate as to what these recommendations might be in advance of Government consideration of the matter.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to privatise Irish Aviation Authority, which was incorporated as a commercial state company in 1994 and is the safety regulator and the provider of air navigation services in Irish-controlled airspace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no current timetable for BGE's privatisation. However, I have written to the chairman of BGE concerning the company's future structure and ownership and I have invited the board to put forward its views on the impact of liberalisation on BGE's structure and related issues such as public/private partnerships and <Col N="944" /> future ownership. The BGE board are still considering these aspects and I would expect to hear from them later in the year.</P>
    <P>I should also add that draft legislation is currently being prepared to establish BGE as a public limited company to allow it greater freedom to operate in a liberalised market.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to privatise Bord na Móna plc. In December 1998 Bord na Móna was incorporated as a public limited company under the Companies Acts. On vesting day, 31 December 1998, Bord na Móna plc took over the staff, assets, liabilities and undertakings of Bord na Móna statutory corporation, which was dissolved on that day. The operating divisions of the company &ndash; peat energy, horticulture, solid fuels and environmental products &ndash; were incorporated as separate subsidiary companies in March 1999.</P>
    <P>On transfer day, 1 April 1999, the staff, assets and so on of the board were transferred to the above-mentioned subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>The four companies are Bord na Móna Energy Limited, Bord na Móna Fuels Limited, Bord na Móna Horticulture Limited and Bord na Móna Environmental Limited.</P>
    <P>In relation to An Post, the Government has given its approval for that company to initiate negotiations on a strategic alliance with a suitable postal operator in view of the changes in the postal sector in the EU. However, privatisation is not currently envisaged or planned for An Post.</P>
    <P>As part of a Government decision of 23 February 1999 to approve an investment programme to upgrade the Whitegate refinery, INPC was requested to actively pursue and report on the scope for other commercial opportunities to underpin the refining operation, including possible joint ventures or a strategic partnership in activities ancillary to, or having a synergy with, the refining business.</P>
    <P>In response to this request, INPC has been conducting a search process to identify business development opportunities, including the possible sale of equity in the company. It has recently received a number of formal proposals from interested parties, which it is currently evaluating. I am prepared to consider all suitable development opportunities for the company.</P>

The main concern of independent insurance brokers concerns compulsory disclosure of commission levels to consumers. In general, disclosure benefits consumers by enabling them to make an informed and rational choice of products available, thus leading to enhanced competition.</P>
      <P>Disclosure of commission should, therefore, exercise a downward pressure on the levels of commission, which are at present not subject to any controls. It should also minimise the scope for mis-selling, including churning of policies. Moreover, disclosure of commission is becoming the norm throughout the financial services sector. Under the Investment Intermediaries Act disclosure of commission is required.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the observations from representatives of independent advisers, our Department sought the expert assistance of the Society of Actuaries to frame the disclosure regulations in such a way as to avoid unfairly discriminating between commission disclosure by brokers and other insurance intermediaries, on one hand, and disclosure of remuneration for salesforces employed directly by the insurers themselves or through tied agents such as banks and building societies, on the other. A formula is currently been devised with the co-operation of the Society of Actuaries, which I believe will achieve equivalence of disclosure, as far as is practicable, between the different distribution channels.</P>

The latest statement entitled &ldquo;Statement Regarding Guarantees by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of Borrowings by Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta&rdquo; was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 May 2000.</P>
      <P>Since 1987, one of NET's main functions has been the management of the State guaranteed debt. In view of this debt management role, the arrangements for payment of interest on the loans is a day-to-day operational matter for NET. I have, therefore, requested the chief executive of NET to write to the Deputy as soon as possible with details of the interest payments.</P>

      <P>Neither the Tánaiste nor I, nor our Department or the Government, has any statutory control over the premiums levied by insurance companies, nor do we have the right to influence the criteria used for covering risk. Our responsibility is to ensure the solvency of insurance companies, so as to safeguard the cover granted to a policyholder and the capability of each company to meet <Col N="948" /> the financial liabilities of its claims responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The formation of the EU Single Market for insurance in 1994, granted access to the Irish motor insurance market to all authorised insurance companies within the EU. This encourages as many insurers as possible to compete on the Irish market so that the Irish consumer is getting the most competitive quotes from the insurance companies availing of the opportunity to compete on the Irish market.</P>

My Department has some concerns in this respect and has already conveyed them directly to the parties involved.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The current situation in the Competition Authority arose from a series of resignations which took place at all levels in the authority over the past nine months. The chairman and one full time member of the authority, together with five supporting professional staff, two legal advisers and three economists, resigned to take up alternative employment. In addition, vacancies arose at administrative level.</P>
      <P>I acted to rectify the situation. I have increased the authorised staffing numbers of the Competition Authority from 24 to 29 by adding five professional staff. The authorised staffing of the authority is now one full-time chairman, four full-time members, 12 professional staff &ndash; five legal advisers and seven economists &ndash; and 12 clerical-administrative staff.</P>
      <P>There are currently vacancies for five economists, five legal advisers and three administrative staff in the authority. Arrangements for the recruitment of economists arising from a recent competition are well advanced and interviews were held last week for legal advisers. The recruitment process to fill the new professional posts will begin soon under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>The new chairman, Dr. John Fingleton, took up appointment last month and a new member, Dr. Paul Gorecki, has taken up his appointment this month. Both have been appointed following an open competitive interview process held earlier this year. Dr. John Fingleton has also been appointed director of competition enforcement.</P>
      <P>This staffing situation placed major constraints on the authority's capacity to investigate new complaints. I am confident that this situation will now change as the newly recruited staff take up their positions. To ensure that the situation regarding staffing is tackled comprehensively, my Department, together with the authority, is currently involved with outside consultants in a study of the authority's operations with a view to having its future resource requirements assessed. All staffing issues are being dealt with in the study. I am fully committed to ensuring that the authority is adequately resourced to discharge its important statutory functions.</P>

      <P>The national development plan sets out the strategies for Ireland's continuing economic and social development over the period 2000-2006. The plan provides for three national inter-regional operational programmes, two of which are the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme and the Productive Sector Operational Programme. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the overall managing authority for both programmes. The third operational programme is the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme which is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The operational programmes will contribute to the overall national objective of the NDP by continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness; fostering balanced regional development and promoting sustainable development through increased social inclusion, more environmentally friendly development and improved economic growth.</P>
      <P>The operational programmes have been submitted to the European Commission and are awaiting approval. The programmes will be supported by programme complements, which will outline in detail the measures under each operational programme. The programme complements will be submitted to the monitoring committees, set up under each programme, for approval. The monitoring committees supervise and monitor the implementation of all measures under the operational programmes.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the various measures in the operational programmes is the responsibility of a number of implementation bodies. These bodies, under the aegis of my Department, include IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the county enterprise boards which promote micro-enterprise development within the national development plan. While the boards are under the aegis of my Department, the measures to give effect to their development are contained within the regional operational programmes and are the responsibility of the various boards.</P>

The board informs me that it has written to the Deputy in recent days on this matter. The board has explained that the landowner does not require the permission of the board to remove the gravel, however, it does draw attention to the obligation on the landowner to comply with the law in whatever he may choose to do. There are, for example, circumstances where planning per<Col N="952" /> mission may be necessary and, in addition, the person must not injure or disturb any fish spawning bed or any bank or shallow where the spawn or fry of salmon, trout or eels may be.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Waterways Ireland that it is carrying out maintenance dredging and bank stabilisation works on the River Barrow between Goresbridge and Ballytiglea Bridge in the interest of navigation. These current works commenced in 1998 and are due to be completed this year.</P>
      <P>The Southern Regional Fisheries Board, which has statutory responsibility for the protection of fisheries within its fisheries region which includes the area in question, informs me that it is in ongoing consultation with Waterways Ireland and that the works are being carried out with due regard for the fisheries interest.</P>

      <P>There is a wide range of salmon conservation measures currently in place dealing with the length of the open season, times of fishing and fishing methods. These measures, which are based on the recommendations of the salmon management task force, have to be maintained in view of the vulnerable state of the salmon stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have established the National Salmon Commission to assist and advise me on future salmon management and conservation strategies. I have asked the commission to provide me with analysis and advice on a range of key priorities relating to the conservation of the national salmon resource. The salmon tagging programme and the national fish counter pro<Col N="954" /> gramme will provide the statistical base which will inform future decisions.</P>
    <P>In relation to generally held concerns about salmon stocks in the River Suir, the staff of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board are monitoring the stock position very closely. In particular, the board has informed me that it is keeping under constant review the operation of fishing weirs in the estuary. No fishing weirs have operated in the Suir estuary during the smolt run in recent years. The board is also drafting a development plan for the river based on the catchment management model. The River Suir is included in the three rivers project under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in partnership with the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>

      <P>There are currently no professional foresters on the board of Coillte Teoranta. The purpose in appointing non-executive directors to State boards is to have access to external expertise and experience and to complement the organisational capabilities of the management of the company.</P>
      <P>The management committee of the company, which is led by the chief executive and which reports to the board, comprises professional foresters and other senior staff in specialist areas. This ensures that the board has full access to all necessary information and guidance in relation to silvicultural or other areas of expertise within the company.</P>
      <P>Appointments to the board since 1989 have always included a representative of the staff of the company. At present, the board includes a representative of the forest worker group.</P>

      <P>A sum of £24 million has been allocated by the Government for tourism and recreational angling under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Of this amount, £17 million has been allocated for the Border, midlands and <Col N="955" /> western regional operational programme. The detailed arrangements for the expenditure of this funding will be finalised following EU approval.</P>
      <P>On the forestry side, it is estimated that £1.54 million will be paid to landowners in Counties Longford and Roscommon under the afforestation grant scheme, which forms part of the national development plan. It is not possible to estimate expenditure on other forestry measures as such is dependant on the level of uptake of these schemes.</P>

      <P>Shelter, a voluntary association in Britain which advises and supports people with problems regarding housing, recently published a fact sheet entitled &ldquo;Irish People and Housing&rdquo; in which it is stated that it is estimated that 11% of people sleeping on the streets of greater London are Irish. This estimate is based on statistics for the year ended 31 March 1999 by ethnic group compiled by the Housing Services Agency, an official body which provides resettlement services for homeless people in London. Those figures show that 57.2% of the &ldquo;rough sleepers&rdquo; were English, 11.5% were Irish and 11.3% were Scottish. I am <Col N="956" /> concerned that there are Irish people in Britain without accommodation at night. There are many reasons why this is so. One reason is that too many young people still go to London and other cities in Britain inadequately prepared. The Government and voluntary organisations in Ireland are doing what they can to assist intending migrants in this regard. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs supports voluntary groups such as emigrant advice who give pre-departure advice and information. FÁS, the training and employment authority, makes available comprehensive information about coping with problems of living and working abroad.</P>
      <P>Through the Díon committee, based at the embassy in London, the Irish Government gives financial support from the Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote to voluntary Irish organisations in Britain which advise and assist homeless Irish people there.</P>
      <P>The Shelter fact sheet mentions that most single people do not qualify for local authority housing as they are not in priority need categories. A report for the British Commission on Racial Equality in 1997 confirmed the existence of discrimination against Irish people there, including when claiming benefits such as public housing. Taking up this point, the fact sheet states that &ldquo;the failure to recognise Irish people as a distinct group means that disadvantages and discrimination may not be recognised. This in turn makes it difficult to develop policies and practices to tackle past and present discrimination&rdquo;. In the next census in England and Wales in 2001, Irish people will be able to describe themselves as a separate ethnic category, a development which should in due course assist in better identifying their problems.</P>
      <P>The social and health problems of the Irish in Britain are currently receiving special attention from the interdepartmental committee on emigration. Irish and British officials are considering the possibility of special action, in the context of combating social exclusion, to address the particular social and health problems of Irish people in Britain, including homelessness.</P>

      <P>Following the conclusion of the UN Covenants on Human Rights, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation which made proposals for the possibility of extending the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, so as to enable the Convention to co-exist with the UN covenants.</P>
      <P>Thus, protocol seven of the European Convention on Human Rights created new rights relating to the rights of aliens in the event of expulsion from a state, the right to appeal a criminal conviction, the right to compensation for a miscarriage of justice, the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence and equality of rights between spouses.</P>
      <P>Protocol seven was opened for signature by the Council of Europe in November 1984 and entered into force in November 1988. To date, all but five of the member states have signed this protocol, with Ireland having signed it in December 1984. The Government is currently considering proposals to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. It is expected that incorporation will be completed in October of this year. The question of ratification of the protocol will be considered in that context.</P>

However, a small number of staff are affected and the Department has implemented a new arrangement under which those staff now liable for income tax are compensated for their loss of salary through a non-pensionable supplementary tax allowance. The allowance is set locally and is calculated based on the federal, state and local income tax rates in operation. As a result, staff affected by the double taxation agreement are in receipt of salaries similar to those of their counterparts who are not affected by the agreement.</P>

      <P>The NGO co-financing scheme receives applications for small scale development projects which meet the basic needs of the poorest sections of the population in developing countries.

The application from Cradle was not considered appropriate under the NGO co-financing scheme as funding for projects for second level schools are outside the scope of this scheme.</P>
      <P>The rehabilitation fund, EPPR, is designed to assist the most vulnerable people in post-emergency societies. This fund is focussed on a limited and specific number of regions or countries which at present includes Rwanda, Bosnia-Herzegovina, East Timor and Honduras. Albania is not a post-emergency society and, therefore, does not qualify under the criteria for this fund.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is never going to be possible to respond positively in every case. Although Ireland's aid programme is reasonably significant in size, and will continue to increase, the level of needs around the world is always going to exceed available funding.

      <P>My Department has commissioned three studies in relation to the light rail project, in order to help define the best options for the development of the Luas system. In June 1996, Oscar Faber Consultants were commissioned to conduct a comparative socio-economic evaluation of potential routes from Tallaght to Dundrum and from Tallaght to Ballymun. That study cost £74,300 and was co-funded by the Exchequer and the EU under the technical assistance programme of the operational programme for transport. W.S. Atkins Consultants were commissioned to carry out an independent study to assess the option of putting the light rail system underground in the city centre. That study, which was funded by the Exchequer to the tune of £251,000, was completed in April 1998. In April 1999, Arthur Andersen and Steer Davies Gleave completed a report on a public-private partnership approach to the Dublin light rail project. That study cost £64,000, and was also funded by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In addition to these commissioned studies, two reports have also been produced by the Light Rail Advisory and Action Group.

This must be achieved on the most economically efficient basis possible. The target will be met by means of additional competitions under the alternative energy requirement programme and direct sales of green electricity to final customers under the accelerated liberalisation of the green electricity market provided for in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. I see my task as creating a regulatory environment for good projects to flourish.</P>
      <P>There may be opportunities for development of renewables on offshore islands under both of these mechanisms. However, it is a fact that proposals from locations such as Bere and Cape Clear islands face obstacles. For instance, access to the national grid presents particular difficulties. In relation to offshore developments, these are likely to be developed on a large scale, thereby achieving economies of scale unavailable to island and small scale projects. This is particularly pertinent to grid connections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, carries out a comprehensive programme of monitoring radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea. It includes sampling fish, shellfish, seawater, seaweed and sediment from the Irish Sea and analysing them for radioactive contaminants such as caesium-137, technetium-99 and plutonium-239,40. These samples are collected from the coastline and the principal fishing ports as well as from the Irish Sea using the Department of the Marine and Natural Resource's research vessel. The objectives of the monitoring programme are to measure the radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea and assess the likely radiation doses to the Irish public and estimate the risks to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant source of artificial radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea is the discharge of low-level liquid waste from Sellafield. In addition, demobilisation from sediments of historic discharges is now an important source of caesium-137 in the seawater of the western Irish Sea. Current caesium-137 levels in seawater from <Col N="963" /> the north-east Irish Sea are typically in range of 20 to 35 millibequerels per litre. There was a considerable increase in the technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield in the period 1994 to 1996 especially and this was reflected in increased contamination of the Irish Sea. As a result of these discharges, I made protests to the UK Government about the impact on the Irish Sea and asked that they should stop. Since then, discharges have been reduced and consequently there has been some reduction in contamination levels. For example, the technetium-99 contamination in seawater for Balbriggan was 45 mBq/l in 1997 and 22 mBq/l in 1999. However, I have demanded further reductions and I await an evaluation from the UK authorities as to how this will be done.</P>
    <P>The consumption of fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea is the dominant pathway through which radioactive contamination of the marine environment results in radiation exposure of the Irish population. The mean caesium-137 level in fish species collected from north-east ports over the past two years was 0.8 becquerels per kilogram. The mean dose to the heavy consumer of seafood from the Irish Sea over the last few years from artificial radionuclides was about 1.5 micro sieverts with relatively little change from year to year. The risk to typical Irish seafood consumers is not significant from the health viewpoint.</P>
    <P>While radiation doses to Irish people resulting from Sellafield discharges are now very low and do not pose a significant health risk to the public, any contamination of the marine environment, due to an installation from which Ireland derives no benefit, remains highly objectionable from an Irish viewpoint. Public perception of the impact of radioactive discharges on the legitimate uses of the sea for marine livelihoods and the enjoyment of the sea's amenities is a reason there is an OSPAR strategy for achieving close to zero concentrations from marine discharges by 2020. I would also refer to other parliamentary questions answered by me today on the subject of OSPAR. The institute publishes its results routinely in a series of reports. Up-to-date results are available on the institute's web-site, which is regularly updated.</P>

      <P>Under the short-term programme, the combination of the infrastructural improvements and the additional rolling stock will increase DART capacity by almost 7,400 places, 39%, and suburban rail capacity by 7,800 seats, 26%, and will allow additional services at peak times and the operation of eight car trains.</P>

One element of the DTO's proposals for meeting future public transport needs up to that date involves the development of a metro system. The DTO made a preliminary presentation of its proposed strategy to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships in April. The DTO is now proceeding to urgently complete its work on its updated strategy, including a full economic evaluation. This strategy will then be considered by the Government following formal submission by the DTO.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999, Iarnród Éireann is currently engaged in doubling the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth. Most of the trackwork has been replaced from Connolly Station to Kilcock. Work on these projects is progressing satisfactorily and will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Currently two six-car train services operate in the peak hour. This gives a capacity of 1,800. When this work has been completed it is planned to operate two additional services using eight-car train sets between Maynooth and Dublin in the peak, giving additional capacity of 2,500. These additional railcars are on order and are due to be delivered before the end of this year and will be entered into service following a period of commissioning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any recent request to provide alternative airport facilities in the Dublin area. As the Deputy is aware, the consultancy study on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction assessed the merits of a second airport for the Dublin area particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>With regard to Baldonnel, the advisers see no reason for the Government to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approvals. They believe, however, that while the development of a corporate jet facility on a commercial basis could be viable, a larger scale passenger airport development at Baldonnel would be commercially challenging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, it has been my understanding for some time that Dublin does not need a second airport in terms of the capacity of Dublin airport to grow for the foreseeable future. I note that the advisers formed the view that Dublin airport is not constrained from a capacity point of view and that it has sufficient capacity to expand and accommodate up to 40 million passengers per annum. The advisers also believe that plans cur<Col N="967" /> rently under consideration to improve surface transport links to the airport will greatly ease current access difficulties.</P>
    <P>These issues are addressed in the advisers' report which is publicly available. I am continuing to give careful and detailed consideration to the findings and recommendations of that report with a view to submitting my proposals on the future of Aer Rianta for consideration by Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department has, as part of its strategy for the aviation sector, the objective of ensuring that the standards, the safety and the security of aviation continue to inspire confidence in the use of Irish aviation and our airports.</P>
      <P>This policy is based on standards which are set internationally, mainly through the International Civil Aviation Organisation Convention to which Ireland is a signatory. Effect is given to this policy through the air transport and navigation Acts and the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. Both Government policy and the development of these standards is designed to ensure continuing acceptable passenger and aircraft safety levels.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority has responsibility for regulating the technical and safety aspects of civil aviation and for the provision of air traffic services and it monitors the activities of airlines in this regard. The IAA also oversees aviation safety standards in the operation of Irish aerodromes and I am satisfied that proper procedures are in place to ensure such standards are being met.</P>

      <P>To my knowledge the mobile telecommunications services available within the State are of a quality that is consistent with that available in the rest of Europe. Mobile telecommunications operators are required to comply with quality of service conditions laid down by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. These conditions are specified in their telecommunications licences. It is also a function of the director to monitor compliance with these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of a top quality telecom<Col N="968" /> munications system, covering fixed and mobile services, is important for economic and social development as well as for economic growth and competitiveness. It is generally recognised that one of the best ways to bring this about is to foster a pro-competition environment that stimulates ongoing investment in both infrastructure and services.</P>
    <P>The delay in the award of the third mobile licence, due to litigation, was not helpful with regard to increasing competition in the sector. It is generally accepted that a third operator is necessary to provide adequate competition and impact on pricing. However, now that the matter is resolved I am confident we will see further significant tariff reductions in the future. The forthcoming licensing of third generation mobile telephony services will also increase competition in the sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As outlined in my reply of 16 May 2000 to the Deputy, all current market demands for electricity are being met by the ESB. I also indicated in my previous reply to a parliamentary question on 24 November 1999, and again on 7 December 1999, that the chairman of the ESB has given me a categoric assurance that there will be adequate electricity supplies provided by ESB up to, and including, winter 2000.</P>
      <P>Regarding additional power generation, work has been completed on the new gas unit at Poolbeg, which has increased capacity by 160 MW from the end of last year. The new IVO plant at Edenderry will add approximately 120 MW of capacity, and is now due for completion in December 2000, over six months ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>I have recently given approval to ESB for capital expenditure of £20 million in relation to the lease of five 22 MW portable gas turbines in order to provide standby capacity at times of peak demand.</P>
      <P>In addition, work is proceeding on plans to upgrade the north-south interconnector from 275 MW to 480 MW approximately, which should be completed around the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, introduced by me, approximately 31% of the electricity market is now open to competition. This will rise to 40% in 2002, and to 100% in approximately five years. This means that any interested party can apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the necessary licences and authorisations to build new plant and start supplying eligible customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the very high level of interest shown <Col N="969" /> by prospective entrants to the electricity market, there is good reason to believe that sufficient capacity will be built to meet market demand.</P>

      <P>The future utilisation of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with me in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard the recent report to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance on the future of Aer Rianta did consider the possibility of a second airport in the Dublin area and this was considered in the context of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>This report which was carried out by Warburg Dillon Read/AIB on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome. Their recommendations will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. Following consideration of the report it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and myself will report to Government with specific recommendations in regard to the future of Baldonnel and which will include all aspects relating to safety and the concerns of local communities. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what these recommendations will be.</P>
      <P>Proposals to amend section 3 of the Irish Aviation Act, 1993 to enable the IAA to regulate the safety aspects of civil aviation operations at military aerodromes are included in the Aviation Regulation Bill which is before the Oireachtas at present.</P>

      <P>Where wet suits are in continuous regular use by individual members of the Defence Forces such as Naval Service divers, they are a personal issue. Wet suits are normally worn over a woollen total body garment. Therefore, as the woollen garment is directly next to the skin, the wet suit itself would not be considered to present any potential hygiene hazard. The woollen body garment requires washing by the individual who uses it, in accordance with normal practice. Where these woollen garments are not themselves a personal issue, the unit concerned is responsible for ensuring they are washed after use.</P>

      <P>The social butter scheme, which was fully fundable by the EU, was one of a number of measures used to contribute to balance within the EU dairy market. Ireland was the only member state which operated it. The aid level was progressively reduced from year to year and a decision was taken by the EU Agriculture Council in December 1998 to allow the scheme to operate for one final year. The new basic council regulation governing the EU dairy regime as agreed under Agenda 2000 did not provide for this scheme beyond January 2000. There was, therefore, no legal basis for continuing the scheme beyond that date.</P>
      <P>The cost and the number of beneficiaries who availed of the scheme over the last five years are as follows:</P>

      <P>The position is that a new area based compensatory allowance scheme is to be introduced with effect from 2001. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a task force representative of my Department and the main farming bodies was established to formulate proposals for a new scheme. The task force met on a number of occasions and having considered a range of options the group recommended a scheme which would involve a payment per hectare linked to the type of livestock on the holding. The proposals envisaged a one hectare payment for each livestock unit. I announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last. I also announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments for the period 2001-06. In the case of farmers with mountain breeding ewes it was envisaged that a payment of £113.33 per hectare for each livestock unit subject to a maximum of 30 hectares would apply. This was the equivalent of £17 per ewe &ndash; one ewe represents 0.15 livestock units &ndash; up to a maximum of 200 ewes.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with officials of my Department the European Commission expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of the scheme being proposed mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. That each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment was seen as continuing the link to production. The task now is to devise a scheme which is best suited to our requirements and which meets with Commission approval. My officials are in continuing contact with the Commission with a view to devising an alternative proposal. Further consultation is also taking place with the farming bodies with a view to formulating such a scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on a total of 24 beef cows under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme; 16 beef cows under the herd number quoted and eight beef cows under another herd number. Both herd numbers have been amalgamated on the grounds that the two herds involved were intermixing and the person named was informed by my Department of the <Col N="976" /> decision to amalgamate the herd numbers on 2 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection of his herd on 13 July 1999, four animals were absent and one animal had no ear tag. The person named was advised of the position on the date of the inspection and was formally notified in writing on 2 December 1999 that no grants were payable on these animals and that the grants payable on the remaining animals would be subject to a reduced payment in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the schemes. The person named was given the opportunity to have this decision and the decision to amalgamate the two herd numbers reviewed by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. While the person named requested a review on 6 January 2000 on the matter of the absent animals, he did not request any review regarding the amalgamation of the herd numbers. On the basis of the additional information provided my Department wrote to him on 20 April 2000 advising that sufficient proof had been provided to verify that three of the four animals absent at inspection were in fact present in his herd during the retention period but were not presented at the inspection. These three animals are now eligible for payment. However, insufficient evidence was given to verify the presence of animal tag number UFA172406 during the retention period nor was there sufficient evidence to verify that animal tag number UGA013517 was retagged by tag number UIA188294. No grants are payable on these two animals and the grants payable on the remaining 22 eligible animals will be subject to a reduction penalty. The person named was given the opportunity to appeal this decision by contacting the Department's independent headage and premia appeals unit. As no appeal has been lodged, payments under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme will issue to the person named within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>Processing of the application was completed on 4 May but a further issue was then identified during an administrative check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named applied for the early retirement scheme on 31 August 1999 under a joint management arrangement with her husband. It is a condition of the scheme that participants must apply, on reaching their sixty-sixth birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. This condition also applies to participants' partners in a joint management application. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this <Col N="977" /> condition when they join, and they are required to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old age pension.</P>
    <P>The applicant's husband reached the age of 66 on 9 February 1989 and was entitled to apply for an old age pension but my Department was not told whether he had done so or been awarded one. If he has been awarded the old age pension, it will have to be offset against payments under the early retirement scheme. Before these payments can commence, my Department is obliged to confirm the position on this issue. My Department wrote to the applicant on 23 May last asking for the necessary information.</P>

The funding relates essentially to measures for farmers and the food processing sector. The following table gives full details.</P>

It is not possible to indicate at this stage when any of the schemes involved will commence but they will all apply in Longford and Roscommon, with the exception of the Western Investment Fund which will apply only in Roscommon and the cattle breeding and equine infrastructure measures which will not apply in either county as they relate to organisations located in Cork and Kildare respectively. The latter two measures will, of course, benefit the whole country as they relate to overall improvements in cattle and equine infrastructures.</P>

      <P>Under the current bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes compensation arrangements, compensation under a range of measures &ndash; reactor grants, income supplement, depopulation grants and hardship grants &ndash; are payable provided the herdowner meets the specified requirements for each compensatory scheme. The relevant information relating to the various compensation measures is contained in a booklet which my Department issued to all herdowners in September 1998. I am arranging to forward to the Deputy copies of this booklet and separate documentation on the eligibility requirements and rates for the 1999-2000 hardship grant scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware in addition to the compensation payable by my Department, a herdowner is also paid salvage value by the factory which slaughters the animal. The amount of the salvage value is a matter between the factory and the herdowner.</P>

      <P>The revenue job assist scheme was introduced in April 1998 to complement the wide range of schemes already available to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The scheme is a focused two-part initiative that gives employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person. Under the terms of the scheme the long-term unemployed person also qualifies for a special tax allowance over a three year period. The scheme has been extended to include persons in receipt of certain disability payments and prisoners released under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>However, where the employer or the employee has or is benefiting under other employment schemes, such as the back to work allowance scheme in respect of the employment for which the revenue job assist is being claimed, relief will not be due under the scheme.</P>
      <P>As a general principle, individuals are entitled to benefit from no more than one employment scheme at the same time and the legislation governing the revenue job assist provides accordingly. I have no plans to alter this condition.</P>
      <P>The revenue job assist scheme is, however, available to individuals who have been in receipt of the back to work allowance for different employment in the past, subject to satisfying the other conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that profits or gains arising to Irish residents who invest on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ via US on-line brokerage firms are chargeable to Irish tax in the same manner as profits or gains arising as a result of investments via an Irish stockbroker. Where the investor is dealing in investments in the course of a trade or an adventure in the nature of a trade, the profits or gains would be chargeable to income tax. Otherwise, the profits or gains would be chargeable to capital gains tax. To determine whether income tax or capital gains tax is the appropriate tax in relation to any particular share transaction, I have been advised by Revenue that it would examine factors such as the number of transactions carried out by each individual investor, the motive of the investor in carrying out the transaction and the circumstances giving rise to the transaction.</P>
      <P>Irish resident investors are statutorily obliged under self-assessment to return all profits and gains derived from on-line share dealing outside the State on their annual returns of income and these returns are subject to the usual Revenue audit programmes.</P>
      <P>I do not have statistics in respect of the volume of on-line share dealing outside the State by Irish resident investors.</P>

      <P>The parliamentary questions and the Adjournment Debate to which the Deputy refers relate to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, this scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions governing the scheme have not been referred to the National Disabilities Authority as that newly established authority has no function in determining whether a claimant meets the medical criteria necessary for admittance to the scheme. The former National Rehabilitation Board provided secretarial service to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. The chairperson of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, who held the post of a senior medical officer with the National Rehabilitation Board, prior to its dissolution and whose post has now been transferred to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, together with another member of the board of appeal made an oral presentation to the review group.</P>
      <P>The review group has met in formal session on six occasions. Oral submissions were heard by the group over a three day period in early May. An advertisement was placed in the press on 11 May 2000 seeking written submissions from interested parties. The closing date for receipt of those submissions was 26 May 2000. I understand that 236 written submissions were received by the group. The group in its deliberations is also informed by the submissions which it received from members of the public and from public representatives prior to 11 May 2000.</P>
      <P>While I have no definite date for completion of the report, I hope that the receipt of the submissions will facilitate the group in its deliberations and in early finalisation. The report will be submitted to my Department for consideration and a decision to publish will be made at that stage. Pending receipt of the report, I do not consider it prudent to make further comment on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxpayers in general have benefited from the tax improvements introduced in the recent budget and Finance Act, 2000, that is, the 2 percentage point reductions in both the standard and top income tax rates, the increase in the personal allowances of £500 single or £1,000 married to £4,700 single or £9,400 married and the widening of the standard rate band.</P>
      <P>Under the new standard rate band arrangements the single standard rate band is increased to £17,000. Two income married couples will have a combined standard rate tax band of up to £34,000 per annum, with a maximum transferability of £28,000, which is equal to two single bands of £17,000 each. This means that the second spouse will now have his or her own standard rate band worth up to £6,000, which reduces their tax bill by £1,320 per annum.</P>
      <P>This will provide an incentive to enter employment and particularly for married women to re-enter the workforce, as they will now have the benefit of their own standard rate band. Previously their spouse would have used up all of the couples married allowances and standard rate band, meaning that, generally speaking, the second spouse would start paying tax at the higher rate from the first pound.</P>
      <P>Child care has become an important issue in Ireland and it raises very important and complex issues. The Expert Working Group on Childcare reported to the Government in February 1999. Its recommendations covered a wide area including financial supports for parents availing of child care services and a particular complaint was the lack of supply of high quality, affordable child care.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the report by an interdepartmental committee, the Government agreed that the most urgent task was to increase the number of child care places. As a result, in Budget 2000, I decided to implement a major package of measures to that end. These measures will cost £46 million in a full year and include a £10 million grant scheme towards the cost of upgrading crèches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Finance Acts, 1999 and 2000, also provided a number of tax reliefs to encourage the provision of crèche facilities and increase the supply of places. The 1999 Finance Act introduced capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child <Col N="985" /> care premises which meet the required standards as set out in the Child Care Act, 1991. These allowances were improved in this year's Finance Act. For expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999, 100% capital allowances are allowable in year one.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Finance Act also provided an exemption from a benefit-in-kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care for their employees. The exemption applies where the employer makes a premises available or, if a joint scheme, is involved in both the management and financing of the childcare facility.</P>
    <P>Child care was also identified as a priority in the national development plan which has allocated £250 million to be invested in childcare over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>Finally, as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is committed to adopting before the end of 2000, an equitable strategy to support parents in meeting their childcare needs. The strategy will be implemented in the period of the programme and will address the question of direct payments per child.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, Ireland is not a creditor of any of the world's poorest countries, nor a member of the G8. It is, therefore, as a member of the multilateral lending organisations, in particular the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to alleviate the debt burden of these countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland has made a significant contribution to the review of the World Bank or IMF debt relief package for the world's most heavily indebted poor countries. Under the enhanced HIPC initiative, the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled and a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief. My concern now is that these improvements are fully financed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants. Ireland contributed £12.1 million in 1999 to the debt relief package and is committed to payment of a further £2.9 million by 2008.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to a question from the Deputy on 6 April 2000, I indicated that while there is a specific tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable projects, individuals can also invest in such projects through limited partnerships. The details are as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 62 of the Finance Act 1998 provides for tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, or £7 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Following clearance of the scheme by the European Commission, I made an order providing that the relief would come into operation from 18 March 1999 for a three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the section 62 relief was designed for a corporate structure, as I said already individuals can also invest through a limited partnership structure. However, in regard to such limited partnerships, I would like to remind the Deputy of a provision in this year's Finance Act which <Col N="987" /> has an impact on the availability of the relief to individuals involved in a partnership structure.</P>
    <P>As a result of an abuse of the right to offset losses, interest and capital allowances of limited partnerships against non-partnership income, I brought forward measures to curtail the use of such partnership losses. Section 70 of the Finance Act, 2000, restricts the application of this set-off, as it applies to non-active partners in partnerships, so that in future, relief for losses, etc., will only be available for set off against income arising to the partnership and will be subject to an upper limit equal to the capital contribution to the partnership.</P>
    <P>In the case of investment in renewal energy, I included transitional arrangements, in section 70, which allow for expenditure incurred under an obligation entered into before 1 March 2001 to be excluded from this restriction. These arrangements are very reasonable in the circumstances and I have no plans to make further changes in this area at this stage.</P>

      <P>Superannuation benefits for Members of Dáil Éireann are paid in accordance with the provisions of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme. The scheme was amended by regulations made by the Minister for Finance on 25 November 1992. The provisions which applied up to that time are referred to as the &ldquo;old scheme&rdquo; and the provisions as amended are referred to as the &ldquo;new scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In broad terms, any serving Deputy who had eight or more years' pensionable service on 6 June 1997 could opt to have all his or her service reckoned for superannuation purposes under the terms of the new scheme or to have his or her service up to that date reckoned under the old scheme. All service subsequent to 6 June 1997 is reckoned under the new scheme. All service prior to 6 June 1997 of any member with less than eight years' service on that date is reckoned under the terms of the new scheme.</P>
      <P>A Deputy with ten years service in the Dáil to whom the new scheme applies is entitled to an annual pension of £9,796 and a retirement gratuity of £29,388, payable from age 50 or from age 45 subject to actuarial reduction, on ceasing to be a Member of the Oireachtas. The annual pension payable in respect of ten years' service to a surviving spouse who has not remarried is half the Member's pension, £4,898.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy with 20 or more years' service to whom the new scheme applies is entitled to the maximum award under the scheme of an annual <Col N="988" /> pension of £19,592 and a retirement gratuity of £58,776, payable from age 50 or from age 45 subject to actuarial reduction, on ceasing to be a Member of the Oireachtas. The annual pension payable to a surviving spouse who has not remarried is half the Member's pension, £9,796, the maximum allowable.</P>
    <P>To the extent that a Deputy has opted to have service up to 6 June 1997 reckoned under the provisions of the old scheme, such service accrues pension and lump sum entitlement more slowly than under the new scheme &ndash; 262/3 years rather than 20 years &ndash; but the benefits are payable on ceasing to be a Member of the Oireachtas, without age restriction.</P>

    <P>Assistant Secretary Bonus Scheme</P>
    <P>In 1994, on foot of the recommendations contained in report No. 35 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, a bonus scheme was introduced for assistant secretaries. Each year 4% of the paybill for the previous year for the assistant secretaries in a Department-office is available to the head of the Department-office to cover the payment of lump sum bonuses to assistant secretaries. The purpose of the bonus scheme, as specified by the review body, is to recognise and reward exceptional performances by assistant secretaries. The number of the bonuses, if any, and the scale of individual bonuses, paid in a particular Department-office is <Col N="994" /> totally at the discretion of the head of the Department-office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Clinical neurology is the national specialty concerned with diagnosis, treatment and the continuing assessment and care of patients with disease of the central and peripheral nervous system and the muscles. Most neurological conditions are <Col N="997" /> chronic, requiring input of care across a vast range of health, social and other services.</P>
      <P>Consultant neurologists treat many complex conditions including Alzheimer's disease; certain brain injuries; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; Huntington's disease, Friedreichs ataxia, cerebral palsy, stroke, epilepsy, migraine and many other neurological disorders.</P>
      <P>These conditions have a wide-ranging, variable and complex set of physical and psycho-social problems requiring specialist expertise both for recognition and treatment. The needs span a wide range of services, including hospital and community-based health services, employment, legal and social services.</P>
      <P>The Irish Consultant Neurologists Association has recently submitted a report to my Department which identifies the need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet the ever increasing demands from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report explores the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing rapidly with new effective complex therapies for many disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease becoming available. The challenge is to develop an integrated, co-ordinated, and dependable health and social welfare system that is geared towards the particular needs of the individual.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every consideration will be given, within the context of the many competing demands and available resources, to providing a comprehensive strategic plan for neurological services in Ireland, including an increase in the number of neurologists and the development of a multi-disciplinary approach towards the management of patients with neurological disability that integrates the hospital and community based services and which recognise the importance of voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>The Irish Neurological Alliance is an umbrella organisation representing the collective goals of many individual neurological charities. The Irish Neurological Alliance has recently completed a report, the first of three I understand, which outlines the standards of care for those with disabling progressive and static neurological conditions. A further two reports will follow which will deal with standards of care for those with non-physical chronic disabling neurological conditions and those with disabling neurological conditions where cognitive decline is a major feature.</P>
      <P>I will be meeting with a representative of the alliance today, 20 June 2000, to discuss this initial report and how services can be progressed on a national basis.</P>

      <P>The health authority has informed me that the area health boards are currently implementing an action plan to improve matters. The main details of this action plan are as follows: the appointment of two additional consultant orthodontists &ndash; these posts have recently been advertised by the Local Appointments Commission; the appointment of additional clinicians with specialist qualifications in orthodontics; and the opening of two regional orthodontic units at St Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, before end 2000 and at Beaumont Hospital before end 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year I have already made an additional £0.3 million available to the health authority on an ongoing basis for the further <Col N="999" /> development of orthodontic services. I have approved capital grant allocations totalling £3.6 million for the development of the additional two regional units at Loughlinstown and Beaumont.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that these developments will provide a significantly improved level of service and substantially reduce waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In addition, at my invitation, the health authority has recently submitted proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment might be further reduced. I will be meeting shortly with the director of planning and commissioning at the health authority to discuss these proposals.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance for people with disabilities was introduced by Department of Health Circular No. 15/79 and is available to all persons with disabilities, including those with a visual impairment, who meet the eligibility criteria laid down in that circular. Circular No. 15/79 states that:</P>
      <P>the scheme applies to persons in the age group 16 to 66 years who are unable to walk and who would benefit from occasional trips away from home.</P>
      <P>Although eligibility is confined to persons who are normally living at home, mobility allowance may continue to be paid in respect of occasional stays in hospital of up to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>As stated, an applicant must be under pensionable age. However, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance is a means tested allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential medical criterion for the grant of the allowance is that the applicant is unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or is in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous. It is necessary that this criterion should be interpreted strictly. The inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year and the applicant must not be forbidden for medical reasons from being moved. The <Col N="1001" /> applicant must be in a condition to benefit from a change in his/her surroundings.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in any individual case.</P>
    <P>The current maximum rate of payment for the mobility allowance, as of 3 May 2000, is £45.60 per month. The rate is increased each year in line with budgetary increases in social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>The article to which the Deputy refers was included in the information pack sent by the Irish Medicines Board to all Members of the Oireachtas and all Irish MEPs as a consequence of the appearance of the officers of the board at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Health and Children and Enterprise and Small Business which discussed St. John's Wort and related matters. The pack consisted of fifteen <Col N="1002" /> different items and included the board's presentation to the meeting, documentation relating to St. John's Wort and the general issues surrounding the safety of herbal medicines, the board's recently published &ldquo;Guide to the Definition of a Medicinal Product&rdquo;, and also the article in question. I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that this article was included as an alternative perception in respect of herbal medicines and which had been published in a reputable international non-technical journal. The board wishes to point out that the inclusion of this article in the information pack did not constitute any endorsement by the Irish Medicines Board of the views expressed in the article concerned.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the Irish Medicines Board plays an impartial role in the regulation of the distribution and sale of herbal medicinal products in Ireland. The Irish Medicines Board has recently published its three year strategic plan which outlines the board's philosophy in relation to all medicinal products including herbal medicinal products. Implicit in this philosophy is the board's total impartiality in its actions.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I would not agree that sending out this article demonstrates an inconsistency in their advertising for a person with a scientific background to investigate and be responsible for the development of a national policy of herbal medicines and that this might be wasted work.</P>

      <Quest>if the regulations currently in place to control the sale and supply of medicines were enacted in the 1960s following the thalidomide disaster, to protect the public from such a tragedy recurring; if he has had inquired into the establishment of a simpler regulatory system for herbal and homeopathic medicines which could reside within the Department of Health and Children and be administered by relevant experts within these disciplines given that the practice of medicine today is dominated by the use and development of powerful pharmaceutical drugs which must be strictly controlled; if he will make a statement on the progress and the steps being taken to ensure the industry will be included in the process given that he has asked both officials from his own Department and the IMB to progress regulation specifically in the area of herbal medicines; if he has had inquiries made into other models being implemented in other member states, particularly Belgium and Holland, given that many countries in the EU are grappling with the same legislative hurdles concerning the regulation of traditional and homeopathic medicines; and his views on whether the practice of this traditional medicine is in grave danger given that herbal practitioners are professionals specifically trained in the use and application of herbal medicines but are currently prohibited from using many herbs in their practice by the proscribing of these herbs.</Quest>

      <P>The current regulations are a continuation of the controls first introduced in the early 1950s to control medical preparations containing cortisone, barbiturates and oral diabetic treatments. The thalidomide disaster of the early 1960s and the debate which followed in subsequent years alerted authorities to the potential dangers of medicinal products regardless of their source.</P>
      <P>The position is that all medicinal products placed on the market must be safe, effective and of appropriate quality for their purpose. In this country the competent authority, having the expertise in this area, is the Irish Medicines Board. It would be wasteful and inappropriate to set up a second authority to discharge this function. In any event any such authority would of necessity have to act on the basis of the same rules laid down by law that the Irish Medicines Board must currently follow. There can be no compromise where the protection of public health is concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department has sanctioned the appointment of an additional senior assessor by the Irish Medicines Board to facilitate a detailed review of arrangements to be put in place for the introduction of the interim licensing scheme. The assessor, titled &ldquo;Project Manager-Herbal Medicines&rdquo; is required to be a graduate in the medical, biological or pharmaceutical area with a demonstrated knowledge of herbal medicines. One of his tasks will be to liaise with the industry and with other interested groups and individuals.</P>
      <P>The recent debate has highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level to the regulation of traditional medicinal products. This matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU Pharmaceutical Committee last year. I do not anticipate an early resolution to the difficulties of harmonisation in this area. Any national scheme introduced therefore, must of necessity have to be on an interim basis pending the introduction of appropriate EU measures when full authorisation of such products will be required on the basis of whatever requirements are to be eventually agreed. Obviously, in the drawing up of any such interim scheme consideration will be given to regulatory models in use in other member states.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the practice of traditional medicine as described by the Deputy is in grave danger.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 150, 151, 154 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provide for notification to &ndash; rather than registration &ndash; and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the <Col N="1005" /> existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
    <P>Based on the most up-to-date information available from the health boards the number of notifications and the number of inspections, including first, second and third annual inspections, carried out to date is as follows:</P>

    <P>Precise information on the number of pre-school providers who have not complied with the notification requirements is difficult to compile. Notifications to the health boards are ongoing as new facilities come on stream and inspections are ongoing also. Health boards continue to take steps to pursue pre-school providers who have not complied with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the regulations in 1996, health boards estimate that the reduction in places arising from the inspection process amounts to approximately 4,000 of which approximately 1,000 are currently being reduced. The reduction took place as the health, safety and welfare of the children could not be guaranteed. Approximately 943 of these are in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area; approximately 210 in the Midland Health Board area; approximately 565 in the Mid-Western Health Board area; approximately 685 in the North Eastern Health Board area; approximately 46 in the North Western Health Board area; approximately 140 in the South Eastern Health Board area; approximately 650 in the Southern Health Board area and approximately 818 in the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>The reduction should be seen in the context of approximately 47,400 child care places for 0-6 age group notified to health boards under the regulations.</P>
    <P>The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per <Col N="1006" /> child in the premises and/or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times. A reduction in the number of places is not necessarily recommended following inspection. Where deficiencies in services are identified during inspection, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction i.e. not replacing children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The timescale for making improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months &ndash; exceptionally, a longer period may be allowed. The Deputy will appreciate that, having regard to my responsibilities, the health, safety and welfare of children must be my primary consideration.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. Funding of approximately £3.9 million &ndash; capital and revenue &ndash; was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 8,000 places were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided for this purpose in 2000.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been allocated £250 million under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for the expansion of its equal opportunities child care programme. The objective of the funding is to increase the supply of child care facilities and child care places and to improve the quality of services available. These measures comprise the equal opportunities child care programme which includes, <i>inter alia, </i>grant supports to establish, renovate, and/or upgrade and staff community based not-for-profit child care facilities and capital grants for self-employed private child care providers to build, renovate or upgrade facilities catering for not more than 20 children at any one time.</P>
    <P>Applications have been invited by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for these grant schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was announced in Budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, will apply to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996 &ndash; the allowances are subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.4 million has been made available to my Department this year to strengthen both the pre-school advisory and the inspection role of the health boards. This will <Col N="1007" /> facilitate health boards in responding to the anticipated increase in the number of child care places.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that there is an information gap in respect of the number of child care places available in this country and the demand for child care provision. In an effort to address this problem, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the European Social Fund has commissioned ADM Ltd. to develop a national child care census and database of group settings, that is, all child care facilities and services excluding individual childminders. This project involves the co-ordination of a national child care census and the establishment of a database on child care facilities in Ireland and will provide information about the range, extent and location of services currently available in terms of quantity and quality. The county by county reports of the child care database, which are almost complete, will provide much needed facts and figures and for the first time baseline statistics on group based child care facilities in Ireland will be available. The database will facilitate analysis of future demand for child care services.</P>

      <P>Most of the counsellors currently being recruited to the health service are employed to deal with victims of childhood abuse. Having regard to the nature of this work, counsellors and therapists are required to have a primary degree in social work, psychology, nursing or medicine as well as a relevant post-graduate qualification or an accredited counselling/therapy qualification. This model was agreed by the health boards and is not considered to be an impractical requirement.</P>

      <P>EEC Council Directives 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 85/584/EEC deal with the mutual recognition of qualifications in pharmacy. Attempts were made by the European Commission on several occasions to introduce <Col N="1010" /> measures which would facilitate the free movement of pharmacists. However, restrictions in most member states on the freedom of pharmacists to open new pharmacies became a major stumbling block to the adoption of any Council directives which would provide for the free movement of pharmacists.  Member states that had restrictions on the opening of new pharmacies were unwilling to remove them and other member states, including Ireland, were unwilling to support a measure which would impact unfairly on their own graduates.  For example, while Irish graduates were restricted from opening pharmacies elsewhere, their peers from other member states were not restricted from opening pharmacies in Ireland and in other countries with no controls.</P>
      <P>Eventually, a compromise proposal was worked out which provided for a derogation incorporated in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC which was a derogation from the obligation to recognise EC qualifications in respect of &ldquo;new pharmacies,&rdquo; in this case pharmacies which have been in operation for less than three years.  Regulations were then made in this country to give statutory effect to the directives.</P>
      <P>Issues arising from unrestricted pharmacy openings were later addressed in Ireland by the introduction of the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996. However, these regulations quickly became the subject of a judicial review and it was decided to defer any change to the regulations dealing with the mutual recognition of qualifications until all legal issues concerning the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, were resolved.</P>
      <P>My view is that the derogation in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC is not a satisfactory solution in the longer term. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it would be premature to amend the regulations providing for the mutual recognition of qualifications until all legal issues concerning the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, have been resolved.</P>

      <P>In view of the current primary immunisation uptake levels generally, my Department wrote to all the health boards requesting them to make every effort to achieve the national targets in this programme this year and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR. Among the issues which boards were asked to address were the <Col N="1011" /> need to undertake an analysis of the reasons for the unsatisfactory level of uptake, to ensure that immunisation databases are regularly validated, to address low uptake in the traveller population and to follow up unimmunised children. Boards have been asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches if considered necessary in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake.</P>
      <P>On 31 May, at a meeting between officials of my Department and senior health board management, the importance of addressing the unsatisfactory uptake of MMR and other primary immunisations was again emphasised and all boards were asked to take the necessary measures to maximise uptake levels.</P>
      <P>The Office for Health Gain has developed a new campaign to heighten public awareness about the importance of MMR immunisation and this was launched today.</P>
      <P>With regard to an alleged link between the MMR vaccine and the development of certain conditions or disorders, I would like to reiterate that my Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is a very safe and effective one. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism and recently published studies in the UK and Europe have further confirmed this. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has indicated to my Department that the factors contributing to the low level of uptake in its area are many and multifaceted, and include difficulties with following up unimmunised persons, the concern of some parents regarding the safety of the vaccine and some general practitioners not sending in immunisation returns. The board has also indicated that these factors are being examined and proposals to bring about an urgent improvement in the matter are under consideration.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity strongly to urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella for individual children and the population generally.</P>

      <P>The drug refund and the drug cost subsidisation schemes were merged into one new drugs payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these <Col N="1013" /> are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79, and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one-third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the provision of incontinence wear to persons in receipt of subvention in a nursing home is covered by the provisions of S.I. No. 227 of 1993 Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, section 16.1 which state that:</P>
    <P>A registered proprietor or person in charge shall not seek any payment in addition to the amount of the subvention determined by a health board and the contribution of the person in receipt of a subvention payable under article 13.1 of these Regulations for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Article 16.2 states that among services which are considered to be essential are bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person, incontinence wear and bedding, and aids and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to estimate the cost incurred by the health service due to drug addiction with any degree of accuracy. Since 1996 a total additional sum of around £24 million has been allocated to drugs and HIV/AIDS services in health boards. However, it would be impossible to estimate the cost of treatment of drug users who are admitted to hospital or attend general practitioners as a direct result of taking drugs.</P>
      <P>Ireland is participating in activities being co-ordinated by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction &ndash; EMCDDA &ndash; on estimating the amount of public spending on drugs. Projects initiated by the centre during 1999 include a network of modelling costs of drug use and cost effectiveness of interventions. Through this project the EMCDDA has created an expert network for estimating costs of problem drug use and cost-effectiveness of interventions using dynamic models. The network on costs consists of three working groups, one on epidemiological and social aspects, one on dynamic modelling and one on economic aspects. The work initially concentrated on the health costs of hepatitis C and B and HIV, while the work will be extended to cover all social costs of all aspects of drug use. The centre, as well as using EU data, will also link with US experts in the field. The timespan for the project is December 1998 to December 2000. This specialist project is at the initial stages of developing methodologies to estimate the impact and costs of various aspects of the drug problem.</P>
      <P>The management board of the EMCDDA, of which Ireland is a member, and member state focal points, which in Ireland's case is the health research board will be kept appraised of developments in this project and its outcome should assist member states to develop reliable and comprehensive estimates of the cost of drug misuse, using common criteria.</P>
      <P>Research into the cost of illegal drug misuse has been listed as a priority for attention for the proposed advisory group on drugs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The particulars to be recorded in the register of deaths are set out in the Births and Deaths <Col N="1015" /> Acts, 1863 to 1996, and in regulations made under those Acts. The Acts provide that all deaths occurring in Ireland should be registered, in the registrar's district in which it occurred, as soon as possible. The person registering the death &ndash; the qualified informant &ndash; must produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner who treated the deceased within 28 days before the death. The qualified informant signs the entry in the register of deaths. The list of qualified informants includes relatives of the deceased and the occupier of the hospital or institution in which the death took place. Once a death has been registered a certificate of the entry in the register of deaths may be obtained directly from the registrar at the time of registration.</P>
    <P>If the deceased was not seen by a doctor within 28 days or if s/he died as a result of an accident or in violent or mysterious circumstances the death must be referred to the coroner, in which case the death will be registered on foot of a certificate issued by the coroner to the registrar containing all the details to be registered. The arrangements for a post-mortem examination and possibly for an inquest can cause some delay in the registration of a death.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy is aware of a problem in relation to the registration of a particular death, perhaps she would communicate the details so that the matter can be investigated.</P>

      <P>Existing consumer legislation sets standards for tanning equipment and requires appropriate warning notices to be displayed on the equipment. I am advised that no licence or medical training is required to operate one. I have no plans to introduce stricter controls in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to use of sunbeds the advice from my Department is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by persons under 18 years of age, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer, and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions is available from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds by beauty therapists in beauty salons were drawn up by the Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients. The health promotion unit in my Department supports a range of initiatives organised by the Irish Cancer Society which impact on awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers including melanomas. A sunsmart campaign is organised each year by the society to increase awareness of risk factors for skin cancer and to encourage people who are high risk to avoid excessive exposure to the sun and to avoid the use of sunbeds.</P>

      <Quest>the capital programmes contained in the national development plan and funded by his Department that have commenced in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon in 2000; the details of any such programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The constituency of Longford-Roscommon is administered by two health boards, namely, the Midland Health Board and Western Health Board. The capital commitments of the Midland Health Board and Western Health Board include a wide range of projects and other initiatives across all health care areas. These also relate to initiatives that carried forward into 2000 from previous years.</P>
      <P>Given the extent of the programme, and the fact that much of the minor capital expenditure is administered by the relevant health boards, and my Department, on a global rather than an itemised basis, it would not be practical for me to detail all such capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>Among the capital works that are planned this year in the Longford-Roscommon area are the upgrading of the casualty unit at Longford Hospital and the commencement of a significant upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the national development plan, I <Col N="1019" /> recently made available an additional £8 million to each board for the important areas of re-equipment and refurbishment works. This sum will be prioritised by each board for the acute hospital and non-acute hospital areas throughout the regions. Other possible capital initiatives for this year under the plan will be considered on an individual basis by the relevant boards and my Department, to take account of normal criteria governing capital projects. These relate, for example, to agreement on costings, timing and priority of projects. The question of new or extended service provision will also be examined in detail in the context of NDP priorities.</P>
    <P>In general, the question of what projects are funded this year in the Longford-Roscommon area, and the extent to which they are funded, depends on the drawdown by the relevant boards for individual projects within their overall capital programme.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment in County Kilkenny is the statutory responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board. I have asked the chief executive officer of that board to investigate the position in relation to the case referred to and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic services are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The plan provides for the development by each health board of a comprehensive orthodontic service under the overall direction and supervision of a consultant orthodontist. The guidelines, which were issued by my Department in 1985, allow for the provision of fixed appliances &ndash; braces &ndash; where deemed necessary by the attending orthodontist. Currently, the waiting time for orthodontic treatment in the South Eastern Health Board area is 20 months.</P>
      <P>This year I am making an additional £100,000 available to the South Eastern Health Board on an ongoing basis for the further development of their orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The orthodontic services were the subject of a comprehensive review by a group representative of health board management and the consultant orthodontists. This group furnished its report, the <Col N="1021" /> Moran report, to the chief executive officers of the health boards. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the chief executive officers on the report and its implications. Some interested parties have also commented on the report.</P>
    <P>Many of the proposals in the report are being implemented as part of the dental health action plan while the implications of others are still being teased out with the health boards and other interests. My Department will give a full response to the chief executive officers on all aspects of the report shortly. In addition, I have also recently asked health boards to submit proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment in their areas might be further reduced.</P>

In accordance with section 43(4) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Fingal County Council (Howth) Special Amenity Area Order (Confirmation) Order, 2000, was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 May 2000. If a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within 21 sitting days after the order was laid before it, then the order shall be annulled accordingly.</P>
      <P>The order is, therefore, available for consultation by Deputies in the Oireachtas Library. Copies of the confirmation order have also been forwarded to Fingal County Council and to all those parties who were represented at the public inquiry into the special amenity area order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not have a budget for completing infrastructure in estates left unfinished by the developer. The question of taking in charge of estates is essentially a matter for each local authority. My Department carried out an informal survey of local authorities in 1998 on the extent of the problems with unfinished estates and the factors contributing to such problems. Replies received from 77 of the 88 planning authorities revealed that 706 estates were then regarded as unfinished, which, with a further 542 finished estates, had not yet been taken in charge. Expenditure arising on the issue of unfinished estates would be dealt with by local authorities in the context of their annual estimates.</P>
      <P>However, under section 2(e) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, conditions may be imposed on granting a permission requiring the giving of security for satisfactory completion of the proposed development. The use of bonds by local authorities has been shown to be generally effective.</P>
      <P>The construction industry federation's national development bond scheme was set up to assist CIF members originally in the Dublin area. The scheme has now been extended throughout the country and a circular letter asking city and county managers generally to give early and sympathetic consideration to its introduction in their administrative areas was issued by my Department in April of this year. This bond scheme will co-exist with the current alternatives of cash lodgment and bank/insurance company guarantee &ndash; some builders are not CIF members and, therefore, are not eligible to participate in the CIF scheme.</P>
      <P>New requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of estates are provided in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The bill provides that where an estate has been finished to the satisfaction of a local authority, the authority must take an estate in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so. Where an estate is unfinished and the period &ndash; seven years &ndash; for taking enforcement action has expired, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will also be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department and bodies under the aegis of my Department are concerned there are a number of schemes and ways whereby assistance may be made available for community type facilities.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities and amenity areas, including community centres, specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for individual local authorities in the first instance. However, appropriate facilities of this kind are, on a limited basis, funded as part of the overall cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations. This funding is related to the size and nature of the individual schemes and my Department's social housing design guidelines contain guidance for local authorities in this regard.</P>
      <P>Funding, including funding provided from the national lottery, is made available to assist the provision of communal facilities in new or existing voluntary housing projects. Local authorities are responsible for determining whether individual proposals comply with the qualifying conditions and the submission of applications to my Department. Authorities are advised in guidelines issued by my Department to seek to have such grant aided communal facilities used to serve broader local community needs such as meals-on-wheels, recreation and social services where it would be compatible with the needs of the residents of the project.</P>
      <P>Under the Regional Operational Programmes, 2000-2006, funding will be provided by my Department to local authorities to implement a wide range of urban and village renewal projects, including, where appropriate, the provision of community facilities. In addition, under the Peace II Operational Programme, 2000-2004, funding will be made available by my Department to county council led task forces in the six Border counties for locally based regeneration, including, where appropriate, assistance towards the provision of community facilities. These operational programmes have been submitted to the EU Commission for approval and a decision is awaited.</P>
      <P>While these would be different application forms, eligibility criteria, etc, for the different types of communal facilities for which assistance is available, the relevant local authority should be consulted regarding the provision of facilities in their area in any case.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative &ndash; DTI &ndash; strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructure projects such as Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-ring, other improvements in public transport, such as quality bus corridors, and traffic and parking management measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructure projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the extension of the DART, the southern cross motorway, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght/Abbey Street and Sandyford/St. Stephen's Green links of the Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and the south eastern and northern motorways. By the end of 1999, an estimated £500 million had been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, over £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office &ndash; DTO &ndash; short-term action plan which is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the quality bus corridor &ndash; QBC &ndash; network with three QBCs now in operation; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced; and the upgrading of the Maynooth Clonsilla rail line is due for completion by end 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Office of Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, has been established to bring greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration within the city and has already achieved significant improvements in parking enforcement and traffic engineering.</P>
    <P>For the longer term, the DTO is now finalising an update to the original DTI strategy, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999 and of a planning horizon to 2016.  This process will facilitate consideration of all relevant measures, including those referred to in the question.</P>

The allocation of a tenancy to any particular individual is solely a matter for the local authority concerned, in this case, Kilkenny Corporation, and I have no function in deciding how it allocates its houses or in deciding who should be selected for a tenancy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service. The intended outcomes of the year are that more needs be identified with which volunteers can help; that more people everywhere offer their services as volunteers; and that volunteer programmes receive increased resources and facilities, to help them assign those new volunteers to tackling the needs.</P>
    <P>In such a year all can gain. Individuals can find a renewed sense of purpose. Volunteer groups can be reinvigorated. Governments and the non-profit and private sectors can enter into fresh partnerships to make for greater participation, alleviate problems and promote good governance.</P>
    <P>The UN Year of the Volunteer will provide a focus for activity to support volunteering. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a national committee on volunteering will be established, with participation from relevant interests, which will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. The committee will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government regarding the setting up of this committee and issues of structures, staffing and finance will be examined as part of this process. I know that various organisations involved in volunteering have already met to discuss how to make the most of IYV 2001. A number of organisations have already made submissions to my Department in</P>
    <P>relation to IYV 2001. All these submissions, including the one from the Carmichael Centre for voluntary groups, will be made available to the national committee on volunteering to assist it in its work.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline Ireland's position with regard to child poverty in the latest UNICEF report; and the way in which Ireland compares with other OECD countries in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17088/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UNICEF report, A League Table of Child Poverty in Rich Nations, includes a number of references to the Irish situation. It should be noted that much of the data available on child poverty in Ireland relates to the early to mid-1990s and the rate of child poverty has fallen in the late 1990s, as recognised in the Combat Poverty Agency's recent submission to the national children's strategy. Having said that, <Col N="1032" /> the Government recognises that much still needs to be done.</P>
      <P>The report recognises that the Irish approach to poverty reduction may have much to offer and states that the national anti-poverty strategy shows that it is possible to conduct a public debate on poverty, to develop poverty reduction targets that command national support, and to establish social goals alongside economic targets as measures of national progress. The report acknowledges that Irish poverty reduction targets have succeeded in broadening and deepening public debate and in winning a new place for poverty on Ireland's national agenda.</P>
      <P>UNICEF also acknowledges the value of a framework, provided by the strategy, within which both economic and social policy can be assessed, and within which governmental and non-governmental agencies can work towards common goals.</P>
      <P>With regard to child poverty levels, the report places Ireland in thirteenth position of 19 countries in terms of absolute poverty and eighteenth of 23 countries in terms of relative poverty, with 16.8% of Irish children living below the national poverty line which is defined as households with income below 50% of the national median. Turkey, the UK, Italy, the USA and Mexico are placed 19th to 23rd respectively in the child poverty league.</P>
      <P>The view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty is widely acknowledged and is fully shared by the Government. The recent 2000 budget provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rates of child benefit, resulting in a full year increased investment of some £106 million, bringing the total provided in 2000 to a record £504.6 million. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) also contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>The best way out of poverty, for both adults and children, is employment. It is Government policy to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. The unemployment rate is now well below the EU average and the live register has fallen by 100,000 since we took up office in June 1997.</P>
      <P>Long-term unemployment has fallen more rapidly than the live register as a whole and employment opportunities have increased. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce. By increasing income from work, not just the individuals themselves benefit, but the families and communities in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> The PPF provides an opportunity to progress a number of policies in relation to the needs of children. Under the terms of Framework III of the programme, new targets will be considered under the various themes of the national anti-poverty strategy, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners. The programme also provides for the strengthening of child protection services.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national children's strategy will seek to build on the efforts of statutory, voluntary and community agencies in a renewed effort to develop more child-focused services.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, all policy proposals across Departments are poverty proofed to ensure that the needs of children, among other target groups, are kept to the fore in the design of policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206, 213 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that this scheme was not terminated in February 2000, as suggested in Question No. 206. My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came in to office in mid-1997, 53,000 individuals have benefited under the scheme. In the last three years £13 million has been provided in the estimates for this scheme and another £5 million for this year. Some 70,000 people have <Col N="1034" /> benefited since the scheme began in 1996. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and have provided a sum of £5 million for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme of community support for older people, grant aid is available towards the cost of: small-scale physical security equipment, such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm which is operated <i>via</i> the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
    <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over, must: be living alone; or be living in households made up exclusively of older people; or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable; and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme a maximum of 90% of the once-off costs associated with the purchase and-or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not provided for under the scheme.</P>
    <P>While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the security needs of the most vulnerable older people were being met, my Department in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme in 1998 to consider how the scheme was meeting its objectives and whether it was doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The review, which was published in April 1999, concluded that the security and social support of a large number of people had been greatly enhanced by the scheme. It also noted that, while the primary purpose of the scheme was to respond to the security threat to elderly people, it also had an important and beneficial health-community care effect.</P>
    <P>While the review indicated a general satisfaction with the scheme among participating community groups, a number of issues of concern were raised by the groups consulted. These included the need for improved publicity for the scheme, the need to ensure that grants are as close as possible to the 90% maximum grant available under the scheme, and for more clarity on how to select applicants on the basis of vulnerability.</P>
    <P>I have actively sought to address the issues of concern identified by participating groups and have endeavoured where possible and with refer<Col N="1035" /> ence to the available resources and the demands which must be met in any given year, to provide maximum funding under the scheme. My Department also actively enhances the profile of the scheme and promotes its benefits by advertising it on a national basis and by disseminating information on the scheme through a range of voluntary organisations and through the community liaison section of the Garda Síochána. Disseminating information in this way also ensures that vulnerable older people in the community who may not be aware of the scheme's potential benefits can be targeted for assistance by voluntary organisations. In addition my Department, to ensure maximum awareness of the scheme, circulated a newsletter outlining details of all supports available to elderly people to some 330,000 pensioners last November with an updated newsletter sent out last week.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the single most important conclusion of the review was that the available resources should continue to be targeted at those elderly people deemed at risk or vulnerable and unable to meet the cost of the equipment themselves. In accordance with the recommendations of the review, it was decided to maintain the existing eligibility criteria for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The review also identified a number of possible options with regard to the future management of the scheme, which included it continuing to be administered by my Department or being administered by other Departments-agencies.    </P>
    <P>Having considered the experience of the scheme's operation since 1996 and the conclusions of the review that the scheme was, and continues to be of significant benefit to many vulnerable older people, a decision was made to continue to operate the scheme under existing terms and there are no plans to amend or extend the scheme. Copies of the review have been sent to the Oireachtas Library for reference.</P>
    <P>The scheme of community support for older people was not terminated in February of this year. In fact, details pertaining to the 2000 scheme were announced as recently as 14 April last and extensively advertised in the national and provincial press at that time. Those advertisements invited voluntary groups seeking assistance on behalf of vulnerable elderly people to submit applications to my Department.</P>
    <P>While the closing date for receipt of applications was 26 May 2000, the regional offices of my Department are and always have been flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern in this regard being the safety and security of vulnerable older people. Individuals who wish to obtain assistance under the scheme should contact their local representative of any organisation actively participating in the scheme, such as, Muintir na Tíre, neighbourhood watch, community alert or any other local group which may be involved in the scheme. Alternatively, they may contact the relevant regional office of my Department.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be attending an approved course of study at a recognised second or third level institution. Courses covered under the back to education allowance scheme range from second level through to third level post-graduate courses of study.</P>
      <P>However, in cases where a person's choice of course falls outside the realm of formal second and third level courses for which the back to education allowance is payable, the programme also contains provision to allow unemployed people and other categories attend approved courses of education, training and development. Participants on these courses continue to receive their social welfare payments for the duration of the course. Education and-or training courses which might be of benefit to recurring drug addicts can be considered under this option. Prior to attending such courses participants are required to obtain my Department's approval. Provided that the necessary qualifying conditions are satisfied, I would be generally supportive of any such measures if they enhance or contribute to the employment prospects of the target group.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf <Col N="1038" /> of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent supplement recipients to retain their rent supplement on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions. Prior to 6 April 2000, any person who availed of my Department's back to work allowance scheme, job assist or other employment support schemes could retain their rent supplement for three years, subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month, provided their household income did not exceed £250 per week.</P>
      <P>New conditions for the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were announced in budget 2000 and came into effect on 6 April 2000. These changes include disregards in the assessment of means and a tapered withdrawal of the supplement over four years. Existing recipients may opt for assessment under either the new arrangements or the previous arrangement, whichever is more beneficial to them.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is on a back to work allowance scheme and is subject to maximum rent supplement of £250 per month. It is more beneficial for this person to continue to be assessed under the old rules for the retention of rent supplement.</P>
      <P>These measures have been designed to assist and encourage people, some of whom are long-term unemployed, to make the transition from welfare into work. Previously a person would receive support at a constant level for the duration of the scheme and then be faced with a sharp drop when moving into full time employment. Under the new tapering system the withdrawal of the supplement is gradual over the duration of the scheme making the transition into full time employment easier.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>I have been very conscious of the need to promote the active involvement of people in community and voluntary groups as an essential component of a democratic society and to foster measures that promote active participation by people in the community. Volunteer bureaux is a vital ingredient in promoting such active involvement and participation by people in community and voluntary groups. They have the capacity to support organisations and volunteers, and to publicise the potential of volunteering to citizens.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service. The intended outcomes of the year are that more needs be identified with which volunteers can help; that more people everywhere offer their services as volunteers; and volunteer programmes receive increased resources and facilities to help then assign those new volunteers to tackling the needs.</P>
      <P>The UN Year of the Volunteer will provide a focus for activity to support the volunteering movement. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a national committee on volunteering will be established, with participation from relevant interests, which will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. The committee will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term. I will shortly be bringing a memorandum to the Government regarding the setting up of this committee.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector will be instrumental in outlining measures, including funding measures, that will support the volunteering movement in promoting active participation by people in the community. I am finalising these proposals for discussion at Government in the coming weeks. At this stage I intend that the White Paper will be finalised in July.</P>

      <P>The provisions relating to judicial pensions are contained in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1998, and the Court Officers Acts, 1926 to 1998.</P>
      <P>Section 26 of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Officers (Amendment) Act, 1998, sets out the pension entitlements for a judge of the District Court retiring at the age of 65 years. Under that section, when a judge vacates his office after five years or more of service a pension of one-eighth of final remuneration with the addition of one-fortieth of such remuneration for each additional year of service in excess of five subject to a maximum pension of one-half of the remuneration is payable. Part years of service are reckoned on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, a pension of one-quarter of final remuneration would be payable in the case of a judge retiring with ten years service and a maximum pension of one-half final remuneration would be payable to a judge with 20 years service. A judge with service between 20 and 30 years service would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of pension. It might be noted that section 28 of the same Act provides for the payment of a retirement lump sum of three times the pension.</P>

      <P>The optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, makes it possible for women, as individuals or in groups, to submit complaints about alleged violations of CEDAW to the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women, an international body of 23 independent experts. The protocol also entitles the committee <Col N="1045" /> to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women's rights.</P>
      <P>My Department is satisfied, on the basis of the advice of the Attorney General's office, that there is no legal or constitutional impediment to the ratification of this optional protocol.</P>
      <P>The usual procedure when signing or ratifying international agreements is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs brings the proposal to Government. My Department is asking the Department of Foreign Affairs to expedite procedures to enable Ireland to sign and ratify the optional protocol as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council agreement was reached in March 1994 which provided, <i>inter alia, </i>for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force who retired after 1 January 1993. The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause, clause 3, of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The claim does not allow for retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1997 the Government decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals <Col N="1047" /> under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3% in their pensions, or 2% in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1%.</P>
    <P>The Government has considered the issue of pension increases for public servants on several occasions since coming into office and, in order to help in its deliberations, referred the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions is expected to be published later this year. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that following Government consideration of the report, a working group of the public service unions, relevant Departments and other appropriate parties will be established to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decision with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pension arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that in 1997 an offer under the PCW, of revised pay scales, retrospective to 1994, was issued to FUGE. This offer was not accepted by the union and the matter was referred to arbitration under the terms of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department and the Department of Finance met with FUGE at an adjudication hearing on 24 May 1999. The report of the adjudication board issued in August 1999. Subsequently, a meeting was held on 17 September 1999 at the request of FUGE to discuss the adjudication board's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adjudication findings allowed for a further assessment in the light of possible changes to court crier duties arising from the establishment of the Courts Service. The Deputy will be aware that since 9 November 1999 responsibility for the management and administration of the courts have been transferred to the Courts Service Board. The chief executive officer, with the agreement of the union, has initiated a process of examining the duties and role of the court crier by the establishment of a working group. <Col N="1048" /> However, these matters cannot progress until such time as the PCW adjudication findings are put to rest. Informal contact has been maintained between courts service management and FUGE at all times since January of this year.</P>

    <P>I can tell the Deputy, however, that while, obviously, not all crime is drug related, it is clear that drug related crime is a major element of the factors contributing to the cost of crime. Garda research has indicated that approximately 66% of detected crime in the Dublin metropolitan area is drug related. While it would be unsafe to apply <Col N="1049" /> this figure outside the Dublin area, it nevertheless gives an indication of the extent of drug related crime.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that costs in relation to drug addiction are also borne by other Departments and agencies such as the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>I should point out that project co-ordinators who have practical experience in youth work, are employed by either the project management committees or by youth organisations. The selection of a project co-ordinator is entirely a matter for the management committee of the project in question.

A total of two probationer gardaí were also allocated to Salthill in 1998.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that local Garda management is satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided in Galway city with the current deployment of resources. The policing situation is, however, kept under continuing review and changes made as necessary. When additional personnel next become available, the needs of Galway city will be fully considered in conjunction with the needs of other cities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I made a comprehensive statement to this House on this advertisement, in the course of an Adjournment debate in the wake of the tragic death of Anthony Cawley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A formal written complaint was subsequently made to RTE by the Prisons Authority Interim Board about the broadcast of the advertisement. I understand that the board, through the prisons' director general, made the complaint out of concern on two counts. First, the board was concerned that a person in the custody and care of the prison service should have been referred to in <Col N="1053" /> such derogatory terms in a public broadcast and secondly, that the advertisement, according to prison staff, caused considerable distress to the person in question in the time immediately prior to taking his own life on the day of the broadcast.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that, having considered the complaint, RTE indicated that it shared the concerns of the prisons board about the advertisement and recognised that the objectionable reference to this prisoner was inappropriate and degrading. I understand that RTE has indicated that the advertisement as submitted to the station should not have been accepted and expressed regret that it was broadcast. I welcome the assurance of the RTE director general who dealt personally with this complaint, that, as a result of this case, the station is reviewing its procedures so that all possible steps are taken to avoid the broadcast of unsuitable words, pictures or any other matter which would risk affronting human dignity.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland has upheld a separate complaint about the advertisement made by the head chaplain of the Irish prisons service and decided that the advertisement breached its code of advertising standards. This adjudication has been publicly announced by the authority. In addition, the National Steering Group on Deaths in Prison have written to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland to register its view on the inhuman treatment of Anthony Cawley by sections of the media. The group, established in May 1996, includes in its membership experienced representatives of prison management and staff and medical practitioners who are involved in prisons work. Its role is to advise me on preventative measures to deter suicides, to provide a forum for collating reports of the local suicide awareness groups in the institutions and to disseminate significant findings and lessons learned through the prison system.</P>
    <P>I believe that the prison authorities who have kept me informed throughout were the appropriate people to pursue this matter and that the outcome of their complaints have vindicated my stance on this subject as set out in my Dáil statement of 18 April 2000.</P>

    <P>(a) Expenditure figures for 2000 are at present difficult to estimate due to the proposed commencement of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, and the consequential setting up of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which will have resource implications.</P>
    <P>(b) The reduced level of expenditure in 2000 on departmental legal representative fees reflects the refugee legal service coming into full operation in that year.</P>
    <P>(c) As training is provided to all staff and persons working in the asylum area, including appeals authorities, it is not possible to provide separate training costs for the appeals process. Total training costs for all staff and persons for 1999 is £41,682; as per (a) above, and particularly in regard to training, it is extremely difficult to estimate expenditure on training for 2000, but it is likely to exceed the 1999 figures.</P>

      <P>While the percentage of <Col N="1055" /> applicants granted refugee status following appeal is approximately 30% on average, it should be noted that an overall percentage of 25% is more accurate when those who do not avail of the opportunity to appeal, those who withdraw from the process or those whose applications are abandoned are taken into account. At any rate, I do not consider the rate of successful applications on appeal to be unduly high.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the situation indicates that a number of factors are at issue. For example, applicants can avail of State funded legal assistance and representation from the Refugee Legal Service, set up by the Legal Aid Board, at all stages of the asylum process. However, fewer than 10% of applicants avail of legal assistance to complete the applicant questionnaire, prepare for first stage interview and only a small proportion take up the opportunity to make a written submission within five days following the interview. By contrast almost all appeal applicants are represented at the appeal hearing. It is likely, therefore, that elements of many applications are presented for the first time at appeal stage. It would be preferable if all information was presented and legal advice was availed of at first stage so that this would reduce the need for some applicants to appeal and reduce the waiting time for genuine refugees to have their status established.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department is currently examining, in conjunction with the UNHCR, the Legal Aid Board and non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council, appropriate mechanisms to increase the take up of legal services at the initial stages of the asylum process.</P>
      <P>Views are expressed on the asylum process on a continuous basis by a range of persons and bodies; these are examined in my Department and taken into account in the development of policy, as appropriate. The Deputy will be aware that the appeals authorities are independent in their function of hearing appeals and making subsequent recommendations.</P>

      <P>Funding of approximately £365 million has been allocated to my Department in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, of which £114.5 million is in respect of capital expenditure on my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, on a programme <Col N="1056" /> to prepare prisoners for employment and on projects to be developed by the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department's equal opportunities child care programme has been allocated £250 million to invest in the development of child care service provision. The amount of £100 million of this £250 million is in respect of capital expenditure. On 28 April last I launched capital and staffing grant measures under the programme and to date almost 3,000 requests for application forms have been received. There is no closing date for applications as the programme is being operated on an open ended basis. It is not possible to say at this stage how may projects will be funded in any county during 2000.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a programme to prepare prisoners for employment after their release. The programme is an expansion of an existing activity which has been carried out within the past two years with EU funding. This is a co-ordinated programme within the national development plan, as regards the agencies within my Department, the prisons and probation services and the Garda Síochána and other State bodies working in this field. The total expenditure on work and training planned in prisons is approximately £46 million of which £7 million is capital expenditure. It is not possible to say how many offenders in the Longford-Roscommon constituency will be referred to the Probation and Welfare Service by the courts or will be in custody to avail of projected developments there. There is no provision in the prison services training and development programme of the national development plan for capital expenditure for implementation in 2000, specifically located in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service of my Department has been allocated funding under the national development plan of almost £25 million of which £7.5 million is in respect of capital expenditure. The proposal in respect of this funding will target a number of groups such as those under 25 years who have been before the courts and are likely to reoffend and become long-term unemployed. Another target group will be women, particularly young women with drug problems and those with families whose lives are disrupted, for example, by domestic violence. The projects to be developed under this programme relate to developments across the regions as needs apply and will cater for those referred to the Probation and Welfare Service by the courts as well as those receiving custodial sentences. There is no capital expenditure planned in 2000 for the constituency of Longford-Roscommon. However, individuals from Longford-Roscommon will be able to benefit from these projects.</P>

The directorate has been accommodating asylum seekers under these new arrangements since 10 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that an environmental health officer from Cork County Council inspected the premises on 16 June and was satisfied that the sewerage system presented no evidence of any public health nuisance. The water supply is attached to the mains system and was considered <Col N="1058" /> adequate. The hotel had been operating on a commercial basis up to May 2000.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that asylum seekers will be accommodated at the Ashbourne House Hotel for six months approximately while their applications for asylum are being processed. There are two rates payable to owners of hotels and guesthouses for full board accommodation for asylum seekers &ndash; £157.50 including VAT per adult per week or £189.00 including VAT per adult per week. The rate applicable depends on the overall standard of the accommodation and facilities provided.</P>
    <P>As it is impossible to anticipate in advance the nationalities, age, etc. of those asylum seekers entering the country and requiring housing, it is not possible to give an exact profile of the category of asylum seekers to be housed at the Ashbourne House Hotel. However, it is intended that the Ashbourne House Hotel will be used in the main as a family accommodation centre due to the type of accommodation and the facilities available at the premises. It is anticipated that asylum seekers will be relocated there in the coming weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the major new initiative for the integrated education of special needs pupils launched in November 1998. This initiative provided the first ever automatic support for many children with disabilities. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring, that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
      <P>The measures extend right across the entire spectrum of special needs and deliver extra teaching and child care services to special needs children, whether in groups or in individual isolated settings.</P>
      <P>The key measures of the initiative include: the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs; and the introduction of a formalised system of child care support for all children with special needs, including those in special schools, special classes, and ordinary schools, who have been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
      <P>The level of response in each case has regard to the number of children and the severity of the disabilities involved. Where a group of special needs children attend an ordinary school or adjacent schools, the support may take the form of full-time resource or child care posts or both. Where individual or small groups of children are involved, the support may take the form of part-time teaching hours or part-time child care support or both. The level of support has regard to the number of children and their particular assessed needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulties arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children. Where special needs are concerned, flexibility of response is essential. Each case needs to be assessed on its <Col N="1062" /> individual merit. The level and type of response will reflect the special need involved.</P>
    <P>The enrolment policy of mainstream and special schools is a matter for each board of management. My Department will sanction additional full-time or part-time teaching support and-or special needs assistant support when requested by special schools to accommodate increasing needs.</P>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate has recently completed an investigation of the educational needs of the pupils attending the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>This report is currently being considered and my officials will be in contact with the school authorities in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The question of an extension of the post-primary school bus route referred to by the Deputy has been re-examined in the school transport section of my Department.</P>
      <P>The position generally is that post primary school bus routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible pupil will have more than three miles to travel to the nearest pick-up point. Pupils residing off the main route of a service are expected to make their own way or be brought to the convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>
      <P>The families who would benefit from the route extension in question reside between one and one and one half miles from the route. This is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is not open to my Department to extend the existing bus route for the pupils in question.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. For the purposes of the scheme, an approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>I understand that the course in question is the B.Sc. in health studies, Queens University, Belfast. The duration of the course is one year and is not an approved course for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Similarly, the course is not an approved course for purposes of the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme.</P>
      <P>Schemes, setting out details of student supports for the 2000-01 academic year, have recently been issued by my Department to local authorities and to the vocational education committees.</P>

It would appear that the pupil in question will be commencing secondary school in September 2000. If this is the case and he has not had an assessment by that time, then he should be referred to NEPS through his secondary school. All secondary schools have access to a designated psychologist from NEPS. This psychologist will also meet his teachers and parents to discuss his educational needs and remediation programme.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this particular school on 30 September 1998 was 86 pupils which warrants a staffing for the current school year of a principal and three mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>

    <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 81 pupils which warrants a staffing for <Col N="1068" /> the 2000-01 school year of principal and two mainstream class teachers. The number of pupils required to retain the third mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year is 83.

      <P>The student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing certain full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state as and from the 1996-97 academic year. The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at post-graduate level and accordingly, there is no grant aid available for students pursuing post-graduate studies outside Ireland. Any extension of the arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses outside Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may be aware that section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provides for the introduction of tax relief for post-graduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax. It will be available to full time and part time post-graduate students and includes distance education courses offered here by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): I am happy to inform you that up to 50 additional psychologists have been selected by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission and will, I hope, be taking up their posts before September. I have already approved the appointment of 25 of these psychologists. The appointments will bring the total number of psychologists in NEPS to 100 and further appointments will be made to increase the number to 200 over the coming years in accordance with the development plan for the agency.</P>
    <P>I am aware that difficulties exist in relation to educational assessments for pupils in primary schools not yet served by the National Educational Psychological Service. Pending the expansion of NEPS, a working group of representatives from NEPS and the Department of Health and Children has been established to put procedures in place to deal with urgent referrals for psychological assessment. In the case referred to in your question, an application should be made to the health board for the psychological service required. I am aware that an assessment is required in order to obtain additional resources for a pupil.</P>
    <P>It is planned to organise NEPS in ten regions, corresponding to the health board regions. The overall allocation of psychologists to regions will be largely based on the projected student numbers in each. In the interests of equity, it is proposed that each cohort of additional psychologists will be shared among the regions on a pro rata basis, until each region has reached its target staffing quota.</P>
    <P>However, within each region, priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county that has recently been undertaken by the NEPS psychologists. Among other matters, NEPS has investigated the level of access to psychological services apart from NEPS. Any local difficulties will be taken into account in planning for expansion at local level.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware children with special needs who are attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis may require special teaching or child care support. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to the support services they require to enable them to benefit fully from the education system. The service in question may take the form of resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated more than 347 additional resource teachers and more than 1,011 child care assistants to cater for children with special needs within the primary system. My Department is continuing to extend these services in response to assessed needs.</P>
      <P>Overwhelmingly the cases to which the Deputy refers are cases involving children with disabilities or other special educational needs and arise under the provisions of the Constitution which require the State to provide for free primary education for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to try to ascribe motives to those parents who have sought redress in the High Court in respect of the education of their children. Neither would it be appropriate for me to comment in any way on their reasons, or on the cases themselves, other than to say that clearly the parents concerned believe that the services which are provided for their children by the State are not adequate to their needs as they, the parents, see it. In seeking such redress the parents, as is their right and the right of their children, are seeking to establish <Col N="1071" /> constitutional rights or to have those rights set down in the Constitution vindicated, in circumstances where they believe the State is in default.</P>

      <P>The women's education initiative, established in 1998, was built upon the principle of participation by the key stakeholders in women's education. The Department of Education and Science, with the support of the European Social Fund, assisted 13 projects to address gaps in provision for educationally disadvantaged women and to develop models of good practice in this area. The aim was that these models would be capable of wider application and would impact on future policy, thereby bringing about long-term change in the further education opportunities for educationally disadvantaged women and men. Child care was provided for participants. Some £600,000 was allocated over 1998 and 1999 for the projects, together with child care funding of £150,000. Expenditure was as follows.</P>

    <P>The initiative has reached its final months and was due to finish in March 2000. The national development plan provides for the expansion of the women's education initiative, and for the inclusion of a men's strand within a broader equality initiative. £3.5 million has been allocated over the period 2000-2006, or £500,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the national development plan, £2.5 million will be used to support groups in the southern and eastern region and £1 million will be used in the Border, midland and western regions. This is the only prior commitment of funding into which the Department has entered.</P>
    <P>A consultation process was held with represen-tatives of men's groups on 27 March last to ensure that the criteria under consideration would not discriminate against applications from men's groups. Applications have been invited through newspaper advertisements, with a closing date of 14 July.</P>
    <P>The criteria are aimed at providing funding for projects which address gaps in the provision of education and training for specific marginalised groups; develop innovative approaches to outreach and pre-development work; build local capacity and test models of community education; develop support structures and provide for accreditation; foster partnership between statutory and voluntary agencies; develop models of good practice in relation to analysing and <Col N="1075" /> informing policy; mainstream learning; facilitate progression of marginalised groups and individuals and disseminate learning and share good practice.</P>
    <P>Subject to these criteria, and to the regionalisation policy within the national development plan, projects will be selected on merit according to the degree to which they effectively target educational disadvantage among disadvantaged groups and without regard to whether these target groups are male, female or mixed. Successful projects will be recommended by a selection committee, based on the above criteria.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently examining the educational requirements of Balbriggan at first and second level, having regard to projected population growth and the capacity of existing facilities to meet demands. In this regard, Department officials have visited the area and are maintaining regular contact with Fingal County Council. When the matter has been fully examined, a decision will be made regarding the appropriate educational provision required to meet the future primary and post primary needs of the town.</P>
      <P>Funding for the provision of adult education services is provided by my Department to the vocational education committees, which are responsible for the delivery of the services at local level. The provision of additional adult education facilities in Balbriggan, County Dublin is a matter for County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>I will shortly announce substantial additional funding for adult education and it will be open to the VEC to seek additional places in line with demand.</P>
      <P>In relation to third level provision, Balbriggan is currently well provided for by a number of existing higher education institutions in the greater Dublin and County Louth area. As regards the pre-school sector, policy in this regard was set out in the White Paper, &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo;, published recently. Planning for the implementation of the White Paper is currently under way in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the findings of the 1997 feasibility study of practical assessment in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Practical work is an integral part of the science curriculum. The limitations on the extent to which practical work can be assessed as part of a terminal written examination are recognised.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study on practical assessment was undertaken to assess if a fair, valid and reliable system for assessment of practical work could be implemented across the sciences at leaving certificate. This study was undertaken in leaving certificate physics and chemistry in spring 1997. The work was directed by a steering committee with representation from the Department of Education and Science and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report by the steering committee indicated in its general conclusions that the model of assessment of practical work tested was considered feasible, reliable and fair and that its procedures had validity. It also indicated that the model did not allow for differentiation between ordinary <Col N="1077" /> and higher level candidates especially in chemistry. The steering committee recommended that the proposed mode of practical assessment be implemented with the introduction of the new syllabi. However, the committee also recommended that minor modifications in the chemistry model and more extensive modifications in the physics model be put in place. In addition teacher training and the resource enhancement programme required to meet the needs of the new syllabi in physics and chemistry were proposed.</P>
    <P>The Department considered the recommendations of the study and commissioned some further analysis. The overall conclusions reached were that the model as proposed, did not allow for sufficient differentiation between candidates. In addition, while the model had achieved some of the objectives set down by the steering committee, it was not considered suitable for introduction into schools in its current format.</P>
    <P>The introduction of practical assessment has far reaching implications, not least for the integrity of the leaving certificate examination itself. Any model of practical assessment must be shown to be capable of producing valid and reliable results. Also, the model of practical assessment adopted must be applicable to a range of science subjects and at different subject levels. The mode of practical assessment should not cause disruption in terms of class contact time.</P>
    <P>I have decided to introduce the new syllabi in physics and chemistry in September of this year without a practical assessment component for at least the first two cohorts of candidates, that is, those taking the leaving certificate examination in 2002 and 2003. This will allow an opportunity to implement the resource enhancement programme, which is currently under way, and to develop the teacher skill enhancement programme. It will also allow time to further explore possible models for practical assessment and to provide training for implementation.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to working towards establishing a method of giving recognition to practical work across the sciences.</P>

      <P>The general aim of the colloquium was to carry out an analysis of approaches to physics education at 16+ within the general education systems of participating countries and to investigate methods of comparing standards in physics at 16+. The proceedings of the colloquium compared and contrasted different features of physics education within the participating countries and identified areas of common concern.</P>
      <P>The following recommendations arose from the proceedings. There should be a general willingness to test current practices in physics education against evidence of their effects and outcomes. A variety of physics courses is required at 16+ because courses which are fully directed towards a preparation for the study of physics in higher education seem to become less attractive for those with other ambitions and interests. It is possible that lowering the standards of the intended curriculum may lead to increasing standards in the attained curriculum. Physics education needs assistance from other institutions, such as professional associations, universities and industries in offering challenging extra-curricular activities for students and support for teachers. Practical work, some of which should be investigative in nature, should be assessed. Further work is required on how this can be done in ways that are both valid and reliable. Some components of high stakes examination systems will have to be assessed by teachers within the context of normal classroom learning if it is accepted that it is impossible to assess some of the important aims of science education by means of short written tests. Induction and classroom practice should be seen as an integral part of teacher education.</P>
      <P>A table comparing features of physics education in the participating countries is included in the colloquium proceedings. The table includes a comparison of curriculum and assessment processes for the eight participating countries with details on duration of physics courses and types and styles of examination papers and practical and coursework assessment.</P>
      <P>The principal outcome in regard to investigating methods of comparing standards in physics at 16+ has been an analysis of the difficulties attached to such a venture which results from differences between countries in physics education at second level.</P>
      <P>A copy of the proceedings of the colloquium will be forwarded to the Deputy for his information.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, the principal of Ormonde College has made alternative accommodation available for the 22 students on the arts and crafts post leaving certificate course because in her view the prevailing conditions at Ormonde College are unsatisfactory.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department, as a matter of practice up to 1979, did not adhere to its own regulations in Memorandum V31, in admitting trainee technical school art teachers into the teacher qualifying examination, the principles of teaching art, and then withheld recognition from those who passed the examination until they complied with entry conditions to the examination which the Department itself did not adhere to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Memorandum V31, which set out the requirements for the award of the art teachers' certificate, provided that the Department's examination in the principles of teaching art, PTA, was to be held in June each year. Entry to the examination was confined to candidates who satisfied specific eligibility requirements as set out in the memorandum. The closing date for receipt of applications for the examination was 30 April each year.</P>
      <P>My Department's position is that only those candidates who were eligible should have been admitted to the PTA examination. That said, my Department is aware of a case where, through error, a candidate who was not eligible was admitted to the examination. However, recognition as a qualified teacher of art requires more than the passing of the PTA examination and as the candidate in question did not have other essential qualifications she did not qualify for recognition until she obtained these.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and two mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 78 as at 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of a shared special additional assistant.</P>
      <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-2001 school year is based, was 77 which means there will be no change in the staffing for the next school year. Unfortunately, there is no basis whereby I can grant a concessionary post to the school. However, the school may wish to examine its position in relation to developing status. The awarding of a developing school post is conditional on a school satisfying specific criteria. These criteria were outlined in Circular 11/00, which was recently issued to all schools. The school may contact officials of my Department in this regard should the criteria apply.</P>

      <P>Having examined the comprehensive submission, I have informed the principal that, in view of the detailed statistics which she provided concerning the particular needs of the children in the infants classes I was happy to approve the appointment of a concessionary teacher with effect from 1 September 2000. This school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher. All available posts were utilised in the current school year to ensure that no primary school in the country should be without a remedial teaching service. However, I can assure the Deputies that I have noted the situation to which they refer and that the remedial needs of the school mentioned will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>
      <P>From the commencement of the current school year, the home-school-community liaison service has been extended to all first and second level schools which have disadvantaged area status. The school referred to by the Deputies was considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme when it was last expanded in 1994. However, the school did not rank high enough on the priority list to be considered for inclusion at that time.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of the school on the 30 September, 1999 was 44 pupils which warrants a staffing for the 2000-01 school year of a principal and one mainstream class teacher. The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher.</P>

    <P>I understand that the board of management of the school is seeking the appointment of a second <Col N="1087" /> mainstream class teacher on the basis that the enrolment of the school for September, 2000 is projected to increase.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria for the 2000-01 school year is outlined in Circular letter 11/2000 a copy of which was forwarded to the board of management of the school recently. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter the enrolment of Achonry school on 30 September, 2000 would have to increase by at least 25 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September, 1999. Accordingly the school would require an enrolment of at least 69 pupils on 30 September, 2000 to gain an additional teaching post.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of the school are confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September, 2000 will be in excess of 69 pupils they should apply to the primary payments branch of my Department for the allocation of a teaching post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a stay in school initiative to tackle the problem of early school leaving has been developed by the Christian Brothers secondary school in Wexford town; the specific supports which he will provide to the school in its endeavours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June last year the major new stay-in-school retention initiative at second level was announced. This provides funding to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they are helped to design themselves. The intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative are multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools and agreed with my Department. This will provide for a range of targeted measures directed at the particular needs of the individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention.</P>
      <P>Late last year 58 post-primary schools, including one school in County Wexford, accepted invitations to participate in the first phase of the project. In May this year a further 59 schools were invited to participate. This includes two schools in County Wexford. The selection of schools for invitation to participate has been based on overall enrolment figures and the number of pupils failing to remain in school up to the completion of the senior cycle, with particular emphasis on junior cycle retention. For some time, my Department has been involved in a detailed analysis of data from individual schools, which has allowed a more complete picture of early school leaving to be developed. This in turn has allowed resources under the stay-in-school initiative to be targeted at schools in a focused way with the objective of helping as many students as possible who are at high risk of dropping out of school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Christian Brothers secondary school in Wexford town and some other schools who have not been invited to participate in the initiative have planned and, in some cases <Col N="1090" /> are implementing, programmes to support those of their pupils who are at risk. I appreciate that these schools are doing very valuable work to retain young people in school and, while it is not possible to provide funding to them under the current phase of the initiative, they may if they wish avail of the service provided by the co-ordinators of the initiative who are available to all second level schools for consultation and advice.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 includes provision of £1.6 billion for capital expenditure in the education sector. This will cover investment in primary and post-primary schools, further education centres and third level institutions, representing the largest ever multi-annual commitment to investment in the improvement of our education infrastructure. In addition there is an overall provision of £550 million for a research, technological development and innovation fund in the education sector, which includes funding to promote the development of a world-class research infrastructure and the provision of equipment in third level institutions, thereby providing the foundation upon which research excellence can be developed.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy, with regard to capital projects, is not available. The allocation of funding to capital projects by my Department depends on factors such as the rate of progress of architectural design, site acquisition, the granting of planning permission and the outcome of the tender process. Delays can arise at any stage of the process. Consequently it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will proceed to construction. If the Deputy requires information on any individual building project, I will be happy to provide the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two facets to the provision made for physical activity in our education system. These are: (1) the formal physical education curricula at both primary and post-primary levels; and (2) the co-curricular sports programmes. There are clear links between these two elements as the co-curricular sports programme relies on implementing the skills, understanding and attitudes developed within the formal curricular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In primary schools, it is recommended that a minimum of one hour per week should be allocated to physical education. It is further envis<Col N="1093" /> aged that an appropriate proportion of the discretionary curriculum time of one hour per week for infant classes and two hours per week for classes I to VI would be devoted to the teaching of physical education, as circumstances may warrant. As part of the revised primary school curriculum &ndash; 1999 &ndash; all teachers in national schools were issued with a new programme in physical education at the start of the current school-year. This is set out in the form of two booklets &ndash; a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims, objectives and content for each class level, and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, the NCCA is finalising new syllabi at junior and senior cycle levels. It is recommended that junior cycle students should have two hours per week of physical education. By 2001, there will an opportunity to study the subject for the leaving certificate. Students who select this course will study the subject for up to three hours per week. Teacher guidelines have been produced to support the implementation of the junior cycle programme. A programme will shortly be put in place for the implementation of the revised syllabi at both junior and senior cycles.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a new scheme of grants for primary schools for the development of sports and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. At an initial cost of £2 million per annum, the scheme will involve an annual grant of £1,000 for each primary school in a disadvantaged area and £500 for all other primary schools. This grant will be used for coaching, mentoring and equipment. Detailed information on the new scheme will be sent to all primary schools at the beginning of the next school year.</P>
    <P>I am also appointing a new national sport co-ordinator for primary schools. The national co-ordinator, assisted by a number of assistant co-ordinators, will have the brief of raising the awareness of sports and healthy lifestyles throughout our schools nationally. I am establishing a national steering group to oversee this project. Charlie Redmond has accepted my invitation to chair this group.</P>
    <P>As regards the linking of the formal physical education curricula with sports programmes, my Department is in on-going contact with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and with the Irish Sports Council. At present, there are two projects in place in which there is joint involvement. The school sport project is an initiative designed to put in place a common training programme for teachers and coaches who are working with school children. This project is being co-ordinated by the National Coaching and Training Centre. The top sport project aims to investigate the provision of a broad-based activity experience for children in a non-competitive environment. It is designed to introduce the core skills and fun sport to children of primary age through the provision of training, child-friendly equipment and resource cards.</P>

One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Circular 3/00 announced the extension of the PESP scheme to all schools with 100 pupils or more from January of this year at an increased grant rate of £40 per pupil. It also stated that, from January 2001, all primary schools that do not have a secretarial or caretaking service under the 1978-1979 schemes, would be grant aided under this scheme. I have recently decided that, the scheme will be extended to all such schools with effect from September 2000 and my Department will be issuing a further circular to schools in September to reflect this decision.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the withdrawal of community employment schemes from schools, the responsibility for the operation of such schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Officials of my Department are engaged in discussions with their counterparts in that Department regarding this issue. In general I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services. The improvements to the PESP scheme that were outlined in Circular 3/00, and the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose has increased from £5.6 million in 1999 to approximately £12.2 million this year, and will further increase to approximately £16.8 million in 2001, are firm indications of my resolve in this area.</P>
      <P>Finally the two schools referred to by the Deputy have the services of a shared secretary under my Department's 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries. I can confirm that there is no question of my Department reducing this service.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently undertaking a survey of all primary and post-primary schools in order to determine the level of asbestos present and the measures necessary to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation are made by my Department and the Office of Public Works. Because of the size and complexity of the remediation programme, a certain level of disruption is inevitable, although my Department and the Office of Public Works make every effort to keep this to a minimum. The school authorities in all cases are given advance notification of the measures being taken and the extent of the work involved and it is a matter for local school management to make the necessary arrangements to facilitate the execution of the work.</P>
      <P>The full cost of the survey and the necessary remediation measures are being borne by my Department.</P>

      <P>The terms of the higher education grants scheme preclude the payment of a grant to candidates who already hold a post-graduate qualification and are pursuing a second post-graduate qualification. An exception is made only in the case of candidates who, on completion of a one year post-graduate course which has not led to the conferral of a qualification, are admitted to the second year of a post-graduate course.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the person in question already holds a post-graduate qualification. She is, therefore, ineligible to receive funding under the student support schemes in respect of the second post-graduate qualification which she is now pursuing.</P>
      <P>However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provides for the introduction of tax relief for post-graduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax. It will be available to full-time and part-time post-graduate students and includes distance education courses offered here by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>
