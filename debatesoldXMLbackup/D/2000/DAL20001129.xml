      <P>It is my sad responsibility to lead the House in tribute to the memory of one of its most outstanding Members in recent times, the late Paddy Donegan. He was a man who truly fitted the description of being larger than life. He was a person of immense enthusiasm for life, his friends, sport and politics. This enthusiasm was infectious. The character of Paddy Donegan in terms of his political commitment is best etched in my memory by the fact that, although he was extremely ill, he attended with his wife and his <Col N="2" /> full-time nurse the most recent Fine Gael Ard Fheis to show that he was still as interested in politics as ever.</P>
      <P>As the priests who spoke so eloquently at his removal and funeral reminded us, the great trial of Paddy Donegan's declining years was that for a man who had so much to say and so much inside him that he wished to communicate, he was deprived of the gift of speech. This was a terrible cross for him and his family to bear. On behalf of all Paddy Donegan's friends and many admirers on all sides of the House, I wish to say how much we appreciate and express our thanks for the devotion his wife Olivia showed to him over the past very difficult and long years of his debilitating illness. While he was physically ill, undoubtedly an illness of a psychological nature was also suffered by his family because they loved him so much and hated to see him in such a way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it would be wrong to look back on Paddy Donegan solely in sad terms. It is sad that he is gone from us, but his memory is vivid in our minds and will remain so for all who knew him. I first came in contact with Paddy Donegan when I was a student and he attended a meeting of the agricultural science society in UCD where he was <Col N="3" /> speaking along with Sir Phelim O'Neill, who was then the Minister for Agriculture in Stormont. Paddy Donegan was an ardent Nationalist &ndash; his name was Patrick Sarsfield Donegan in memory of a man he greatly admired &ndash; and he would have described himself before all else as a Jacobite.</P>
    <P>However, the fact that this Jacobite could share a platform so comfortably in UCD with Sir Phelim O'Neill, a distinguished Unionist notwithstanding his Gaelic ancestry, showed the largeness of the spirit of the man. Paddy Donegan had the ability to reach across the big divide between Unionists and Nationalists on this island. While he was a Nationalist, Unionists felt an affection for him almost without equal on this side of the Border in the political system.</P>
    <P>I feel the loss of Paddy Donegan in a very personal way because his wife and her family, the Mackens and the Crinions, are close personal friends of mine. They are not relatives, but we are so close that it is as if we are related and I feel his loss greatly for that reason. He was, so to speak, a neighbour. He helped me with my maiden speech in the House, which was on the esoteric and irrelevant subject of the Grass Meal Bill. I remember approaching, with some timidity, the then Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Paddy Donegan, a distinguished figure. I had only met him rather casually, apart from that previous time I mentioned when I was a student. I told him rather timidly that I would like to speak in the debate on the Grass Meal Bill, which was being promoted by Neil Blaney, the then Minister for Agriculture. I thought he would ask me what I knew about it, which would have been a very profound and just question. However, I had decided that I had better speak about something and that it should be something sufficiently minor so that I would not appear to be over stepping the mark as a junior Deputy.</P>
    <P>Instead of being discouraged, I could not have been more encouraged by Paddy Donegan. Not only did he say, &ldquo;Of course, speak&rdquo;, he invited me to have a meal in his club &ndash; which he did not have to name but which was the Stephen's Green Club &ndash; with a number of people in the grass meal industry, so that I could hear exactly what he was hearing about how best to approach the Bill. That was the first occasion on which I was the recipient of his hospitality.</P>
    <P>Paddy Donegan's hospitality was legendary. If he knew one was within 15 miles of Monasterboice, one was likely to be invited to dinner or for other forms of ancillary refreshment. He was an exceptionally generous man. I do not remember a more generous politician, in the broadest meaning of that term. He was generous both materially and psychologically.</P>
    <P>People tend to reduce anyone's career to one episode. There is a great risk that commentators will reduce the career of Paddy Donegan to one episode. I will say a word in a moment about that episode. However, before doing so, I want to put <Col N="4" /> on record that I believe &ndash; and I say this with no disrespect to the current Minister for Defence or any of his predecessors of any party &ndash; that Paddy Donegan was the best Minister for Defence we have had under our current Constitution since 1937, bar none.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Defence loved the armed forces or advocated their cause with the same enthusiasm as Paddy Donegan did. He did so at a time of enormous peril to this State and its democratic institutions, when paramilitary organisations were engaged in unparalleled assaults on democracy. Paddy Donegan recognised that the defending line of democracy was and is our Army, which stands between us and chaos. He recognised that its morale had to be maintained and that it had to be supported. He increased the size of the Army and its equipment levels at an unprecedented pace. However, more importantly, he identified with the people in the armed forces in a fashion that made them feel he felt their pain whenever they were under threat.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that when approaching this one episode which the superficial may tend to pick out in two line recollections of Paddy Donegan's career, that is, the episode in Mullingar barracks when he made remarks which led to the then President vacating his office. Those remarks were made against a background where a member of the Army had been blinded in a search he was undertaking of premises where it was suspected the IRA had been hiding material. Apparently, the premises were booby-trapped, there was an explosion and the soldier was blinded.</P>
    <P>Most cool and calculating politicians would, perhaps, stand back from that, give their speech and put that emotional experience out of their minds. They would create a Chinese wall in their minds and ensure their official response to events was not influenced by the emotional pain they might feel as a result of something like that happening. Paddy Donegan was not that sort of man. Perhaps that was a fault, but, if so, it was a very good fault to have.</P>
    <P>He was deeply upset by what had happened. In his upset, he said things he ought not to have said and included people who deserved no criticism for doing their job as they saw fit. Paddy Donegan was not the sort of man who, in the difficult circumstances in which he was in, could allow that sort of rational calculation to influence what he said at all times. However, it is important to understand that Paddy Donegan said anything he said in a spirit of loyalty to the people for whom he was responsible in the armed services, the State and its institutions, including the President of Ireland. It is important, when looking back on his career, to put that in its proper context. I hope the House will forgive me for having spoken at such length.</P>
    <P>Paddy Donegan was an extremely successful businessman. Many families owe a lifetime of employment to him. He was successful in the hospitality business in the Monasterboice Inn and <Col N="5" /> also in the grain and other related industries in which he was involved in Drogheda. He was a successful farmer as well as a successful politician and a truly enthusiastic sportsman. He represented Ireland internationally in shooting and was actively involved in equestrian pursuits and other activities.</P>
    <P>Paddy Donegan was a great politician and a great person. He truly leaves a void. I thank the House for affording me this opportunity to pay these inadequate words of tribute to a great friend whom I have lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Bruton in extending our condolences to the family of the late Paddy Donegan, his wife, Olivia, his sons, Tommy and Vincent, and his daughters, Rosanne and Annette. Deputy Bruton is correct in recalling that Paddy Donegan loyally served his constituency over three decades. From all the stories I have heard of him, he did so with all the character, energy and commitment which Deputy Bruton spoke about.</P>
      <P>His Oireachtas career began more than four decades ago in the mid-1950s. He served as a Senator for four years in the 1950s. He lost his Dáil seat in 1957 and was re-elected in 1961. He served in the House for 20 years, including his period as Minister for Defence, until he retired from national politics at the age of 58 at the start of the 1980s.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt, from all I have ever heard about Paddy Donegan, that he was a loyal and enthusiastic member of Fine Gael at national and local level. He was always prepared to do his utmost for his party. As Deputy Bruton told us, he was prepared to do that even when his health was against him, which is to be admired.</P>
      <P>Paddy Donegan's service was recognised by consistent support from the people of Louth in elections. He also served on the county council, which he was very proud to chair. He was a member of the agriculture committee, the harbour board and the health board. He was also a member of the Federated Union of Employers, in which he was an activist.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy was also a prominent member of the local business community and played a key role in Monasterboice as a miller and farmer. His business interests led him to membership of the Irish Grain and Agricultural Merchants Association, which was a very important organisation at that time because it had individual industries in almost every substantial town throughout the country. He was also well known in the labour relations area because he had worked with and taken a great interest in the joint labour committees, particularly the one relating to the milling industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was known, as Deputy Bruton said, for his wide involvement in sports clubs, including the Louth Hunt, the Irish Cruising Club, Dundalk Association Football Club, Drogheda Association Football Club and Drogheda Rugby Club. <Col N="6" /> He took a great interest in all of them and assisted them in whatever way he could.</P>
    <P>Many in the House will remember the late Paddy Donegan as a man with a very strong personality. He served his constituency and his party to the utmost in his long and lively political career and in difficult times for the country, times we never wish to see again. On behalf of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party I extend our sympathies to Paddy Donegan's family and friends, especially in the Fine Gael Party. He was a close family friend to Deputy John Bruton who will deeply miss him. I also extend our sympathy to his former constituents and especially to his wife and children. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I extend our sympathies to the Donegan family, to his wife Olivia, his two sons, Tommy and Vincent, and his two daughters, Roseanne and Annette. I also extend our sympathy as parliamentary colleagues to the Fine Gael Party, especially the leader of that party who has lost a colleague, mentor and friend.</P>
      <P>Public service in this country has been demeaned in recent times by events that are still unfolding in Dublin Castle. Whatever differences one might have had with Mr. Donegan, people would have to realise he was committed to public service. I would have disagreed with him fundamentally on many issues, but I respected the contribution he made and his dedication to the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon might recall it was in his home in Dundalk that I first met former Deputy Donegan. My late uncle, Owen, was Deputy McGahon's father. He was also a Louth county councillor, a political colleague of former Deputy Donegan and effectively his director of elections on a number of occasions. I recall both his presence and my father's trenchant disagreement with him on whatever was the political issue of the day. Our paths crossed in this House, but I did not know him because of a generation gap. On behalf of the Labour Party I extend our sympathies to the Fine Gael Party and to the Donegan family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and Deputies John Bruton and Quinn in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the late Paddy Donegan's widow, Olivia, his two daughters, Annette and Roseanne, and his two sons, Tommy and Vincent. I also extend our sympathy to Deputy John Bruton and his Fine Gael Party colleagues. Deputy Bruton has lost a close friend and political ally. It speaks volumes for the man that at a time when he was seriously ill he attended the last Fine Gael Ard Fheis accompanied by his wife and his nurse. It indicates his level of commitment to public service and to politics over a long period. He served in this House for 23 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy John Bruton that it would be unfair to Paddy Donegan and to his life long <Col N="7" /> commitment to public service and politics if he was to be simply remembered as a result of one controversial incident, even if it led to the resignation of the President. He served his party, his constituents in Louth and this House with great distinction.</P>
    <P>I had experience of his hospitality when as a young Senator, and accompanied by a large group of people, I called to his establishment in County Louth. I did not realise he was the owner and although he was not present my attendance there was communicated to him. His hospitality knew no end. I extend our deepest sympathy to Deputy Bruton, his widow and family at this sad time.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh le muintir Paddy Donnegan, le Fine Gael agus go mór mhór leis an gCeannaire John Bruton ar bhás an iar-Theachta.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I extend our deepest sympathy to Paddy Donegan's wife, Olivia, and family. I did not enjoy the privilege of serving with Paddy Donegan in Dáil Éireann, but his strong personality had a big ripple effect around the Dublin North constituency, where I live, as well as in County Meath and south County Louth. Not many in public life attain a legendary memory of service. Paddy Donegal was one such person. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. I became a member of Louth County Council in 1979 and as a young councillor I was lucky to share the council with former Deputy Donegan. He was a colossus of a man. He was someone one could look up to and learn from. I pass on my condolences to his wife and family, especially to Tommy, who replaced Paddy on the council for short period. His going will be an awful loss to the Fine Gael Party. As Deputy John Bruton said, he attended not only árd fheiseanna but many conventions over the years. No matter how ill he was he was always part of the Fine Gael Party in my county. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my unhappy task to follow Paddy Donegan after a very short interval when he retired because there was no way I could emulate him or fill his shoes. However, I consoled myself with the belief that very few people in County Louth or any other county could fill his shoes.</P>
      <P>Paddy Donegan was something else. He was different, flamboyant and colourful. He was not po-faced, as so many politicians are. I do not speak of anyone here. He was a big man, big in stature and big in heart and, as Deputies Harney and John Bruton have acknowledged, he was big in generosity. He was also big in compassion. He served the people of County Louth in a wonderful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> I acknowledge the great tribute paid to him by his political foe but personal friend, Padraig Faulkner, one of the quiet gentlemen of politics. Padraig lived very close to him. He and Paddy were the kingpins in County Louth at a period of economic growth and progress in the 1960s. They worked together for the betterment of the people of County Louth. It was much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Paddy was very colourful. Some of his comments will be forever associated with his name, including the famous reference to a kick up the transon and the sensitive use of the word &ldquo;thundering&rdquo;. The former comment occurred when he introduced a novel but very effective method of encouraging a group of unwanted guests who were gathered outside his lovely bar. I am sure younger Members of the House do not recall it, but it was a memorable event and will never be forgotten in County Louth.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of his patriotism. He was a very patriotic man. He took particular pride in his stint as Minister for Defence. Many past and serving members of the Defence Forces who talk to me about Paddy Donegan express appreciation for his efforts. He refurbished barracks, built modern barracks around the country and introduced an acceptable level of accommodation for soldiers. He felt very deeply about the Army. When a soldier was blinded he made his famous comment in an emotive outburst.</P>
    <P>Many tributes have been paid to him, but the best of all was paid in a lovely little country church in Tenure on Monday night when, before a packed assembly, many of them Fianna Fáil people who while they did not love him admired and respected him, the elderly officiating cleric, Fr. McArdle, told the congregation that Paddy Donegan's life was a thundering success all through. The assembled multitude gave a spontaneous round of applause. It must have been sweet music to the ears of the Donegan family because it was a justification and vindication of how both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael people of County Louth felt about the old war-horse of County Louth politics.</P>
    <P>Paddy had a few detractors in the press, but who does not? They were all part of the arty-farty congregation or, to borrow a word from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo;. I have Gene Kerrigan on my back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not have a bet on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the House a few things which are not generally known about Paddy outside County Louth. He was a God fearing man and a devout Catholic. He was also a wonderful husband and a good father to his children. He had one tremendous asset in his life which does not fall to every man, namely, a wife who is excellence personified. Olivia is legendary. Her commitment to their marriage was known in every household in <Col N="9" /> County Louth. It was not always easy for her. In the past 20 years, when Paddy had one crippling illness after another, Olivia was always at his side. She brought him to party meetings even at the end of his life. That showed Paddy Donegan's commitment to politics and to his country. The support of his wife was a consolation and an inspiration to Paddy, particularly in the last 20 years of his declining health and years.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael community in County Louth, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Olivia, and to his family, Rosanne, Annette, Tommy and Vincent. I am sure I also speak for many Fianna Fáil people who admired and respected him. May he rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in paying tribute to the late Paddy Donegan and in offering our condolences to his wife, Olivia, and to his family.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers outlined Paddy's role and participation in politics. He represented County Louth for 27 years. He was an excellent public representative. Longevity is a feature of the political culture of the county, although I do not know if that will continue. Paddy was colourful, outspoken, strong and forthright. Those characteristics are also seen in his immediate successor, Deputy McGahon. He retired as a Member in 1981. I served with him on Louth County Council from 1979 for a number of years. He was an important, influential and wise member of that body. He served as its chairman and he was successful during his time in office.</P>
      <P>It has been rightly said that his period as Minister for Defence was characterised by significant support for the Defence Forces. I know he was held in high esteem by the members of the Defence Forces when he was Minister.</P>
      <P>He was also a successful businessman, which is often overlooked. He was involved in the milling and provender business and in the restaurant business. His businesses gave significant employment in County Louth, particularly at a time when the industrial base was not as broad as it is today. He was a significant and important person in Louth during his period in this House and in business.</P>
      <P>He will be sorely missed, particularly by his wife, Olivia, and his family. As Deputy McGahon rightly said, his wife, Olivia, supported him in his declining years. He was dogged with ill health in recent years. His extended family also gave him tremendous support.</P>
      <P>An aspect of Paddy Donegan's personality which is often overlooked is that he was a successful sportsman who was involved in a range of sports. He will be remembered as an influential midfielder for a now defunct GAA club in Drogheda, St. Dominics. He also successfully participated in other sports. I join with other speakers in offering my sympathy to the Donegan family on this sad occasion.</P>

      <P>The outcome of the discussions was set out in the joint statement issued late last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained the Government's commitment to the new taxi regulations given that his proposals of last year to issue in excess of 3,000 taxi licences, which would have put all those taxis on the street prior to last summer, were challenged in the courts. We now have new High Court judgments. It is not possible and neither do we intend to amend or delay the new regulations. It was also made clear at yesterday's meeting that the Government is anxious to progress a number of the mitigating measures such as the refund of certain licence fees paid to local authorities and special tax allowances for actual capital loss for the benefit of existing taxi licence holders. The Minister is willing, as already stated, to work with taxi interests and others to develop further quality improvements for taxi services. The taxi group expressed its serious concern at the disruption and the hardship that the new regime would bring to their membership. It specifically identified a number of key issues which it put in the public domain last night and which were noted in the Minister's statement. The Minister noted all these concerns raised but said that cognisance must also be taken of legal constraints. Both sides accepted the importance of continuing the process of dialogue around these and other issues relating to the new taxi regime. This process will be established quickly. Another meeting will take place next Tuesday. Work will be co-ordinated and overseen in the meantime on the Government side by the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This <Col N="12" /> process will address the detail of the mitigating measures for existing licence holders and development of further qualitative improvements.</P>
    <P>In relation to who is paired or not paired, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy has a long standing commitment but that does not affect his acceptance of a proposal that there would be a person designated to move on the various issues of consultation over the next few days. That person will be the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Minister of State on his return will take up the work, wherever it is at that stage. Time will not be lost and there will not be any delay.</P>

      <P>Could there ever be more eloquent evidence that as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, Ministers do not matter, that the Minister at the centre of the most difficult issue facing the country currently, the absence of a taxi service, can go to Mexico? That proves that politicians do not matter. The Taoiseach has 15 Ministers of State, any one of the other 14 could have gone to Mexico. Is this man serious at all? Is the Progressive Democrats serious at all that it would send one of its tiny band off to Mexico at a time when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and his friends are trying to reinstitute regulation of a kind that is restrictive in an area where we need more taxis, not more restriction?</P>

      <P>It must be with incredulity that the nation is learning that Deputy Molly, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has a long standing engagement and commitment to go to Mexico at a time when there is crisis, at a time when we have this problem with the regulation of the taxi market and the liberalisation of the numbers that would participate in it. Will the Taoiseach indicate or confirm that Deputy Molloy has left? Can he indicate if he will recall him to resume the negotiations, or is it the case that the Government is on hold, that automatic pilot is operating on the Fianna Fáil side and that it does not really matter who is the Minister? As long as the permanent government, the Secretary General is there one does not really need Ministers? Is that what the Taoiseach is saying to the nation? Are none of the other colleagues capable of taking up this long standing commitment in Mexico City? The Taoiseach has an obligation to inform the <Col N="13" /> nation through this House when Deputy Molloy will come back to resume negotiations.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I feel a bit like a relay runner here. This is my third time to stand up here in the course of my 20 minute slot. It does not make it easy to keep the thread of thought or discourse.</P>
      <P>The Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 2000, provides for the handing over of a substantial debt of about £187 million to the National Treasury Management Agency. What has amazed me so far in the debate is that the Government acts as if this were a matter to be dealt with routinely in this Bill. In the Minister's introduction to the Second Stage we heard what I could only call contempt for the Irish taxpayer and the elected representatives in Dáil Éireann in the total failure to explain or attempt to explain, if explanation is possible, the fiasco that the management of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta's debt has been up to the present time. It is an extraordinary situation. It is incredible that the Minister of State would make no effort to explain what has transpired since NET took over the debt in 1987. We have the extraordinary situation where, on a debt of £164 million in 1987, there was a staggering £188 million in interest payments alone to banks and financial institutions. In the year 2000, the bulk of the principal debt is still outstanding. Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta was borrowing money from banks to pay interest to the same banks on the initial loans. That is my reading of the situation, yet the Minister has failed to give us any kind of explanation for this disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, I sought details from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the amount of interest paid to each of the four or five banks &ndash; a relatively narrow group of banks &ndash; which held the NET debts guaranteed by the State. The Minister provided the overall figure of £188 million but referred my request for <Col N="20" /> specific amounts to the chief executive of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta. In a letter dated 13 July, the chief executive refused to provide that information. He sent me copies of NET's annual reports and financial statements from 1987 to 1999 which showed the amount of interest paid in each year and went on to say:</P>
    <P>You will understand that the operational management of our debt portfolio, banking relationships and, indeed, business relationships in general are, by nature, confidential. I regret, therefore, that I am not in a position to give the information requested.</P>
    <P>That is highly unsatisfactory. When the Minister of State closes the debate, I want him to provide that information, specifically in regard to the £30 million loaned by Allied Irish Banks plc. in 1988 and 1989. On 31 December 1999, an amazing £17.9 million was still outstanding on the principal of that £30 million tranche. Will the Minister of State inform me how much interest has been paid to Allied Irish Banks on that loan since 1987 and will he provide similar information in regard to every other bank which loaned money to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta? This is information to which taxpayers, who own the semi-State companies, are entitled. If the total amount of interest paid to the banks was much greater than the original amount loaned, was more than £30 million paid in interest on the £30 million loaned by AIB with the bulk of the principal still outstanding? </P>
    <P>We have an incredible scenario where successive Governments have stood by and allowed the banks to legally pillage the resources of a semi-State company to fatten their already bloated profits; nobody cried &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to come into the House, gloss over this fact and fail to provide any explanation why this legalised robbery of the Irish people was permitted. The funds which should have been going towards investment and diversification were sucked out of NET simply to increase the banks' profits.</P>
    <P>NET was contracted to purchase gas from Bord Gáis and sell it on to IFI. One semi-State company was purchasing a natural resource, which properly belongs to the Irish people in any event, from another semi-State company and any profit realised went towards feeding the maw of the banks.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser market will come under severe threat owing to environmental and other concerns. However, IFI is the only company which produces fertiliser and if the massive amounts of money received by the banks had instead been invested in the company, it could have diversified into the production of natural fertilisers, composting, etc., as an alternative to chemical and polluting fertilisers. Doubtless, the Government also intends to sell off IFI, a measure to which I would be absolutely opposed. If that happens, the workers' jobs and terms and conditions of employment must be guaranteed. The Government must not betray a workforce which has <Col N="21" /> served the State well by inserting one provision in this Bill to allow the company in question to be sold off to a multinational bidder which will not have any allegiance to the workforce, the Irish taxpayer or the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin tá ceisteanna tromchúiseacha le freagairt ag an Aire maidir le fiacha NÉT agus faoi mar a riaradh na fiacha úd. Cuireann sé déistean orm nach bhfuil aon eolas ag teacht ón Aire nó ón Rialtas mar gheall ar an oiread úis a íocadh do na bainc ó NÉT.

      <P>The Bill before the House concerns State housekeeping and is designed to facilitate the transfer of liability for the historical debt of NET to the Minister for Finance who, in turn, will transfer management of the debt to the NTMA. These are limited, though sensible, measures which should have been implemented before now and which deserve to be supported. What is likely to flow from the enactment of this legislation in terms of what the future holds for the company and its employees?</P>
      <P>During our previous discussion on the Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, treated us to a very engaging stroll down memory lane in which he recalled the industry's heyday in Arklow. I was disappointed that the Minister avoided any meaningful reference to how the company got into its current state.

I do not object to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is a busy woman, introducing a Bill in the House and asking her junior Ministers to deal with it. However, I do object to her treating this matter as if it were a parochial issue by giving it to the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise to trot out cant about people he knew when men were men in Arklow 30 years ago. Since the Minister wants to be contentious, I wish to point out that is not the way to deal with legislation in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The accumulated debt of £187 million is large enough to have deserved some comment by the Minister. The disastrous agreement reached with ICI in particular warranted some assessment, albeit with the benefit of hindsight, a point to which I will return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year was one of the worst for the fertiliser industry for many years. While IFI did not have a good year, most players in the industry fared no better. The world leader in the industry, Norsk Hydro, managed a massive loss of about £200 <Col N="23" /> million. Of course, the fertiliser industry is notoriously vulnerable to variations in commodity prices. Gas, its raw material, is subject to enormous variation, while the market for its product can be seriously affected by swings in agriculture as well as changing environmental demands relating to the use of fertiliser. Add to this the flooding of the market by cheap gas from eastern Europe, which has now subsided, and one has an idea of the turbulent nature of the world of fertiliser production.</P>
    <P>At this stage the related problem of over-productivity in the industry is disappearing, which augurs well for the company. However, the interest rate problem again surfaces, as it has in the past, which is all the more reason to remove it from the situation for good. This should not take away from the fact that IFI has been profitable and seems to have been quite well managed over many years. The recent poor performance comes against a background of difficulties in the industry at large and the disastrous agreement reached with ICI, which allowed it to legitimately leach funds from the company which it badly needed. This was in accordance with the disastrous service agreement, which was called in regularly, despite the burden it placed on IFI.</P>
    <P>The main component of the NET debt was the massive overrun on the construction of Marino Point, not trading difficulties in the company. In normal trading life investment would either have been provided for in advance by the shareholder or subsequently, although this may have been in breach of EU rules. Whatever the explanation, to saddle a company with a burden of debt, which was not far off £200 million, over many years was to do it little service and represents a lack of clarity to say the least in the shareholder's policy. That said, the tiny number of staff in NET managed some fairly spectacular success in the management of the debt, on occasion outperforming the NTMA in its debt management strategy.</P>
    <P>What will be the future of NET? In the absence of the debt management function it might be said to be limited. Even if it is limited it is still important. It is the only vehicle which will permit continued worker participation in the company. While such involvement has been a disadvantage in theory and practice, the NET worker directors have shown the real value this can add to the business in both directions. Second, the company has acted as a strategic think tank for its subsidiary and provided a mechanism for the Irish shareholder to protect its interests, especially when the non-national shareholder was shedding involvement in the fertiliser business. Fortunately, I understand relations with ICI are now greatly improved. Nevertheless there will be an important role for the board of NET in protecting the State's investment in the company while its future is fully decided. It has the capacity to develop a strategic view of the subsidiary com<Col N="24" /> pany's future, which is often denied company boards faced with the immediacy of its operating activity.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister chose not to comment or set out the future role for the board of NET. Second Stage was the ideal time for the Minister to inform the House of the role the board is expected to play. All we know is that the company is for sale and that the Bill provides that worker participation and State enterprises legislation will not apply to NET in the event of it disposing its 51% shareholding in IFI. It is regrettable that this step is considered necessary to prepare the company for sale. We have no indication from the speech of the Tánaiste, read by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, of the strategic role, if any, she envisages for the industry. Will this be a bargain basement sale where the only criterion will be the highest bidder? The workers at three locations need to know, now that the burden of debt is gone, if they will be exposed to a purely speculative purchase. Given the needs, for example, of the agricultural sector, surely a compatible purchaser ought to be sought and encouraged. I appreciate that farmers have not always been loyal to the domestic strategic interest.</P>
    <P>What role, if any, is envisaged for the worker directors after the sale? The workers are concerned that the communications system, now well established, should not be undermined. The Minister has not really given any undertakings during the course of the debate that the workforce will be informed and consulted about perhaps imminent decisions which are likely to profoundly affect the future of their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>I ceded my position earlier in the debate at the request of Deputy Joe Higgins who wanted to make a contribution. I wish to return to the central point he raised. I hope the Minister has calmed down. With respect, it is entirely legitimate to suggest that if the Minister comes to the House to pilot the Bill he should be able to deal with central questions which arise on Second Stage. This is a matter of great concern. The Minister spoke about a private company, but there is no private company about which it could be said, as the Minister said in answer to a parliamentary question on 8 June, that between 1987 and 1999, £188 million was paid in interest on the debt. It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to address this as the situation may arise again, not in relation to NET but in relation to other companies. Can we be assured that there is greater expertise than there was when that disastrous agreement was entered into in 1987? There is nothing contentious in the House about expecting the Minister to address this issue.</P>

    </table>
    <P>The conclusion one has to arrive at from looking at the table &ndash; and virtually every bank in the country has been favoured by the taxpayer in this arrangement &ndash; is that the banks did exceptionally well out of it. Yet in 2000 the principal is <Col N="26" /> still outstanding and we are handing it over to the National Treasury Management Agency to manage it. In the interim, interest of the order of £188 million has been paid on the debt. Before glossing over what is essentially a housekeeping measure <Col N="27" /> and given that the National Treasury Management Agency is charged with managing the national debt and is deemed to have done a good job, it seems sensible to do this. I would have no objection to that. Since Committee Stage is not the place for a discussion on the principle of the Bill and the issues involved here, Second Stage is the place for such a discussion. If the Minister chose not to discuss this in his introductory speech I hope that whoever gives the closing speech for the Government will address the issue because there are questions that need to be answered.</P>
    <P>The table to which I refer deals with the schedule of banks going back to 1988 and right up to moneys that have been raised, for example, £50 million from the Bank of Ireland, where the guarantee is dated as recently as 29 November 1999 for £50 million. I do not think we can put a nail in the coffin of NET as we used to know it, and gloss over that entire period. That is a very reasonable point.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal at all with the position in terms of preparing this company for sale. He told us much about all the people he knew in Arklow and so on and the tremendous work they did but there are workers there now who are accustomed, after a very difficult period, to putting in place structures in an area where there was no confidence in the past. Good communications channels have been established, the role of the worker directors on the board is appreciated by all sides but there are no assurances in terms of what happens after the worker participation State enterprises legislation no longer applies in the future. The year 1987 was of huge significance in the lifetime of this company but it is not the only period of huge significance given the cyclical nature of the industry. Clearly things could have gone under in 1987 and at a time of high unemployment people could have lost their jobs. I am not suggesting that applies now but it does not mean to say there are not concerns among the work force at the three locations as to what are the implications in terms of industrial relations, communications and consultation within the company of the changes in prospect. The Minister's speech did not deal with that. This is the opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary questions have been tabled from time to time on this issue and there have been some discussions. The Tánaiste made it patently clear that this is preparatory to privatisation, sale of the company and a prospective purchaser being found. I emphasise the importance of taking care to ensure that a compatible partner is found. This company is still of significance in the agricultural industry. There are companies in the agricultural area that have the capacity and, it seems to me, the synergies with NET that are required to go forward into the future.</P>
    <P>Now that the balance sheet has been tidied up there are many people, including people on the board of NET, who are seriously concerned that <Col N="28" /> what we are not doing here is preparing a bargain basement sale and that the Minister will sign on the dotted line to whoever is the highest bidder, irrespective of the purpose and intentions of that bidder, and that that is the last we will hear about it.</P>
    <P>Given the history of this company and the developments in the country since the 1987 deal, I do not think it is practical to oppose the principle of the Bill. While it is presented as a housekeeping measure it is more than that in the sense that this House effectively gives the nod to the privatisation of the company. That is the stage we have reached. There is no cogent argument I can advance that this company ought to be maintained in State ownership. As a fertiliser production company it is not a public utility in the same sense as is the ESB or a company involved in the provision of water. I have no objection provided the decision is made in terms of the best strategic interests of the agricultural industry and of the people who work in the company. When replying I hope the Minister will address these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's contribution was a sensible one and many of the questions he raised are worth raising. The Deputy will recall we were both on the Committee of Public Accounts in the 1992 when we looked at indebtedness and the management of indebtedness in the semi-State sector. At that time it ran into billions of pounds right across the sector. One of the arguments we had with those responsible was that given that the NTMA was managing the overall debt it would be appropriate that this debt, which was a millstone around the neck of NET, would be transferred at that time. It is appropriate, therefore, in 2000 that I should welcome the move given that we heralded that situation as far back as 1992. Given what has been said it is important to set the perspective in relation to this company. Following the gas find off Cork in the 1970s a major consumer was sought to ensure the viability of the operation. The ammonia plant at Marino Point was viewed as a major opportunity in terms of demand for the gas from the Cork field. The company being set up in Marino Point got the gas at an exceptionally low price. Under the special arrangement, difficulties arose with the construction of that plant. The overrun at the time was in excess of £70 million, which was quite dramatic. We should now ask what controls were in place at that time to allow such a cost overrun. However, that millstone hung around the neck of the company for all those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons we looked for a strategic partner was that the borrowing requirement of the company was in the region of £200 million at the time. The company was in serious debt and there was major concern that it would collapse with the loss of approximately 350 jobs. The necessity for a strategic partner became obvious. The difficulty at the time was that it was not the <Col N="29" /> best possible climate in which to seek such a strategic partner. Over the years we have all issued statements on the arrangements entered into and the fact that many of them may not have been in the best interest of the State at the time. However, the arrangement entered into was in the best interest of the community, the workers, and particularly the State, in that the gas now had a definitive consumer.</P>
    <P>At the time the whole idea of the repayment of the debt centred on the fact that the gas was being supplied at a very special price. It was felt that the profits and advantages which would accrue to the company could be ploughed back in to reduce the debt. The way the company managed the debt was significant, well ordered and compares very well with other State companies. The difficulty was exacerbated when special arrangements for the supply of gas came to an end because, as Deputy Rabbitte correctly pointed out, the fertiliser market worldwide fell apart. Prices fell apart, oil prices increased dramatically and, of course, there is a direct connection between the price of oil and the price of gas. The inevitable question then arose as to how to deal with the debt. At long last the decision has been made and, as in the case of the health board debts, the time has come for the State to take over and manage this debt.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the debt is being transferred from State ownership. Obviously, the company is being prepared for sale. We already know there have been two suitors for the company but the price being offered by both of those companies does not meet the price that should be demanded. It would be terrible if the State made the same mistake on two occasions. We must ensure the company holds out for a much better price than has been offered by the two companies that have come forward to date. There are companies in the agricultural sector who could take over this company, run it effectively and integrate it into their overall operations.</P>
    <P>If the company is being privatised or sold off, it is legitimate to ask what will happen to the workers and their future. The Bill deals with the worker-director issue. Section 5 enables the Minister to make an order which would discontinue the entitlement of the four worker-directors to be elected to the board. I am not sure the workers would be too concerned about their membership of the board but they would be certainly concerned about the long-term commitment of any new company to the workforce in general and to the continuity of the whole manufacturing entity of ammonia and fertilisers in the plant. The issue is significant from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on a related issue, the relationship between the Marino Point plant and the general community surrounding it. At a time of environmental awareness, the safety record of the Marino Point plant and other plants has been excellent. They have been well managed and their health and safety record is exemplary. If Marino Point was currently being built, it certainly would <Col N="30" /> not be allowed to locate in its present position. The location of this plant was dictated by the exigencies of the 1970s when it was easy to bring the gas pipeline into the facility. That obviated the necessity for putting the plant in place but it would not be allowed to locate in that area today.</P>
    <P>That plant and its relationship with the surrounding community will be significant in the future. I am referring to the European directives relating to risk industries and how these risk industries and the directives will impact on the immediate communities. I will give an example of an ironic twist in this regard. Many of us in the constituency agreed that the core of the town centre of Passage West was to a large extent derelict and would be ideal for urban renewal status. A lot of lobbying took place and there was much integration of activity between the local authorities, public representatives and those living in the area to obtain urban renewal status. We were successful in 1999 and major housing development is now taking place together with urban renewal. When seeking urban renewal status, we had recourse to the health and safety authority to see what would be acceptable. We were aware of the Seveso 1 and Seveso 2 directives. We looked at the regulations as they pertained to developments within two kilometres of the Marino Point plant, together with other plants.</P>
    <P>The quayside development, which included a port and a dock, which was regarded as a dirty industry, had a series of derelict buildings along the quay wall and, therefore, it seemed appropriate that we should consult with the Health and Safety Authority. The authority referred those involved to the UK regulations which were being operated internationally at the time. It indicated the booklet from which the Health and Safety Authority was operating and said that if those concerned were operating within the guidelines they could continue with the work. Developers then decided to look at the viability of developments in the area and suddenly the goal posts changed. The new COMA directive is not included in legislation here but the Health and Safety Authority must examine every development that may be seen as a risk industry. Passage West urban renewal was suddenly the focus.</P>
    <P>New regulations are contained in the COMA directive. These are US regulations which are far more stringent than those which were in operation when the submission for urban renewal was put in place. When people had invested heavily &ndash; one person invested £2 million &ndash;  in preparing plans and co-ordinating activity with the local authority and with the Health and Safety Authority, they were suddenly told that substantial residential development in the Passage West-Monkstown area was not recommended. This directive is having an immediate impact on Passage West but it will also impact on Tivoli, Little Island, Ringaskiddy and other strategic areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the relationship between the Marino Point plant and the general com<Col N="31" /> munity within which it operates. Until now there has been an excellent relationship between both. I brought a deputation to meet the Minister on this issue. When development has been agreed and complies with the regulations which apply at the time, it is unfair to tell people they can not go ahead with a development just when they are ready to start. Such an action is morally unsustainable and I asked the Minister to investigate it. It would be an understatement to say I was disappointed with his response and I have told him of my intention to say so during this debate. The Health and Safety Authority has told the Minister it has carried out risk assessment and is concerned about substantial residential development.</P>
    <P>The authority has also brought Nítrigin Éireann into the matter to say it has carried out a study and would not favour large scale residential development across the water. The Health and Safety Authority failed to tell the Minister that this study was carried out between six and ten years ago when the company was seeking a licence from the EPA, and had nothing to do with the current issue. I regard this as duplicitous, underhand and completely wrong. I call on the Minister to return to the Health and Safety Authority and ask it to produce the study referred to in a letter from the authority to him. The Minister will find that the study is out of date and takes no cognisance of the safety standards put in place in the plant in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority points to two issues which are of concern. The first is the direction of the wind. In 20 years, the authority's monitoring station in Passage West has never recorded a concentration of ammonia in the air because the wind does not blow in that direction. The station might be different for Little Island or Cobh. The authority takes issue on a six metre pipe and the dangers of the release of ammonia from that pipe. One wonders if modern technology has moved on. If there has not been a major problem in 20 years, given modern technology and monitoring, how can there be a major risk? Ammonia does not explode and cannot catch fire. It is possible to work in an area which has a 25% concentration of ammonia. What about the 3,000 houses built in the area and currently being built? I wonder if I am living in the real world. Sanity and fair play must be applied to this issue.</P>
    <P>This will have consequences for the plant where more than 200 people are working. The interim report on the strategic plan for Cork projects major developments for Midleton, Carrigtwohill and along the railway line to Youghal but residential development in Passage West or Monkstown is not mentioned. Are we to assume there will be no development in this area for the next 20 years? Is it conceivable that this could happen? Why is this plan in place if there is to be no residential development in Passage West and Monkstown? This poses a serious question <Col N="32" /> regarding the viability of the plant. The issue is extremely divisive. Calls are already emanating from Passage West and Monkstown and will soon emanate from Cobh and other areas close to the plant, asking if sustainable development within a town is more important than a facility which is blocking development and investment. This is a serious issue which has wide repercussions for the relationship between industry, its workers and the general population. It will impact adversely on the development of the Cork Harbour area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution. As Deputy O'Keefe has said, this is an important plant for many reasons.</P>
      <P>A strange event recently occurred in the Cork Harbour area. A short power failure, which only lasted a number of seconds, led to the closures of the Irish Refining plant in Whitegate, the Ispat plant and the IFI plant in Marino Point. While it took some time for the IFI plant to become operational again, safety mechanisms worked, the plant shut down safely and no incident occurred. The IFI plant must meet EPA guidelines in order to remain open. It has the most modern technology and constant monitoring is carried out. The plant is safe. I raised this matter with the Tánaiste when a slight accident occurred there some time ago. She told me there was no evidence to support media reports of a problem at the plant or of danger to the public.</P>
      <P>I know management and workers at the plant are always quite concerned about safety which has to be paramount in such a plant. We are now talking about preparing the company for sale &ndash; whether that will happen is another issue &ndash; and under no circumstances should short cuts be taken in regard to safety where this plant is concerned. No matter where it comes from, investment in safety must be maintained in the plant both for the workers and the public. I am confident that is happening but I feel I must say that today, particularly in view of what Deputy Batt O'Keeffe has divulged to the House.</P>
      <P>On the strategic importance of IFI, I have been told that without IFI, Ireland would be the only country in Europe without an indigenous fertiliser industry. We are an island nation and the fertiliser industry is of vital importance to our agriculture industry, which is one of our largest industries. We cannot be at the mercy of foreign imports. I would like the Minister to tell us what guarantees he plans to put in place to ensure this plant is kept open in the event of a sale.</P>
      <P>There is another plant in the area which is related, that is, the Irish refining plant which the Government is in the process of selling. Again, that is of strategic importance. Deputy Rabbitte said that perhaps IFI is not of strategic importance. I do not totally agree with him &ndash; I think it is of strategic importance. If we were at the mercy of imports from abroad, if fertiliser is dumped here and if we are charged very high prices, then the agriculture industry could suffer and there would be corresponding knock on effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> IFI produces roughly 1.5 million tonnes of fertiliser per year; I think about 0.6 million tonnes of that is exported. Another important factor concerning IFI is that it contributes hugely to the local economy. It is estimated that over £70 million is contributed to the local economies of Cork, Arklow and Belfast. We must remember there is a cross-Border dimension here which I am sure the Minister will agree is important and desirable.</P>
    <P>I know a lot of capital expenditure has been put into IFI in recent years &ndash; up to £100 million or so &ndash; to keep it up to standard. For safety and productivity reasons, that has to continue. We know there are employee representatives on the NET board at present &ndash; that has been alluded to by other speakers. Part of the Bill envisages that in the event of a sale of IFI, this will cease. It would not make sense if it did. Many of the employees in the plant are constituents of mine and Deputy Michael Ahern and we have to ensure their employment is guaranteed in the event of a sale, and I am sure Deputy Ahern will be at one with me on this. That is quite important. I have already spoken about the strategic importance of the plant to the national interest but we also have to look at the importance of keeping these plants open because of the employment they generate and the contribution they make to the local economies both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>This plant or company will probably eventually be sold into private ownership. What guarantees or supports will the employees get in the event of such a sale? I know ESOPs were entered into in other such ventures and I know they are being discussed at the moment with the Irish refining people. Will the Minister tell us whether this has been examined by his officials or himself and what effect will it have on a possible sale? There is also a very large healthy pension fund associated with the company. Perhaps the Minister will give us some guarantees as to the position of that pension fund in the event of the sale going ahead. Will the pension fund be guaranteed and how will it be operated? I would like to hear some detail in regard to that.</P>
    <P>I understand IFI is now profitable but in the past that was not so. The main thrust of this Bill is to prepare for the sale of IFI and to transfer the debt to the National Treasury Management Agency. In the very unlikely event of the company's profits falling &ndash; it is a very cyclical industry and profits rise and fall &ndash; a sale did not go ahead and the State was still the main shareholder, what would happen if the company went into a downward spiral in regard to profitability? The Minister might look at that.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the moment in regard to the sale? I know that over 12 months ago, and before that, there was a flurry of activity in trying to offer this company for sale but that seems to have ceased. Has the Government decided to wait a while and not to sell the company for the time being? There is a certain amount of uncertainty about the future of the company because of that. Will the Minister tell us what he intends <Col N="34" /> to do? Are discussions under way with other companies, either nationally or internationally, in regard to the sale of this company? I know there is confidentiality involved but is the company still openly on the market or has it been withdrawn? </P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to IFI involvement? I understand ICI got a very good deal and has done very well out of this company over the years. I do know whether it has put an awful lot into it. Maybe the Minister will tell us the position in regard to its involvement. I understand this is the only company it has left in which fertiliser is being manufactured. When summing up, maybe the Minister will refer to that.</P>
    <P>During the recent ILDA-CIE strike &ndash; the last time we discussed this it was ongoing &ndash; the company was under a lot of pressure. I am glad that matter has been resolved but it showed how vulnerable this company is. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe mentioned that if Marino Point was being built now, it would not be constructed where it is.</P>
    <P>I have said to some representatives of the company that the company needs to do some public relations work. The company is safe and has contributed to the local community, especially in Cobh where it contributed to the construction of a promenade which was very welcome. There is a need for a company such as IFI to be proactive in its public relations and let the public know it is safe and what it has done to ensure the safety of the plant. This is something which could form part of Government policy, that is, that such companies would be proactive and would reach out into the community.</P>
    <P>When, and if, any incidents occur, such as the recent ESB shut down which led to the shut down of other plants, such companies should have a mechanism whereby they would liaise with local communities. There have been incidents in Irish Ispat &ndash; explosions in the plant. Many companies seem to just man the bunkers and do not inform the public of what is happening. This leads to fears which are, most of the time, unjustified in terms of what might have occurred. There is also media speculation about dangers to the public and so on. That is not welcome or helpful. Companies should take a pro-active approach and have a strategy in place to deal with such incidents, which are relatively few, when they occur. Experience has shown that if a company is up front when an incident occurs there is no commotion about it but if it tries to hide it, there is suspicion and speculation. The company is damaged as is the relationship between it and the community. While that has not happened in IFI it could do more in the public relations area, as could other companies. Deputy O'Keeffe's comments reinforced my views on that.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater research on the impact on the environment of plants such as that at Marino Point. We know the EPA monitor them but we must be in a position to reassure the public on the safety of these plants. We must close the stable door before the horse bolts. What <Col N="35" /> procedures are in place in the Department to strengthen this area?</P>
    <P>I welcome this timely Bill. I am anxious that the plants remain open and that the safety aspects be reinforced. I am concerned that the employees be safeguarded. Perhaps it might be possible to have employee representatives on the IFI board. I do not know if the Minister considered that. I am anxious that the company is not just bought and closed down. If that happens I understand the plant in Marino will revert to a greenfield site. I would like the Minister to comment on the pension fund and the future of employees, whether there will be ESOPs and so on. There should be continuing investment in safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. Like my colleague, Deputy Stanton, I live next door to the plant. The last time I spoke in connection with NET was in 1986 at the time of the setting up of the joint venture company, Irish Fertiliser Industries, a partnership between Richardsons of Belfast and NET. NET was a holding company which was to service the debt.</P>
      <P>My interest in the plant goes back much further than 1986, to the late 1970s when the plant was constructed. At that time, the building industry was in the doldrums but the construction of this facility ensured work for people not only in east Cork but further afield. People from all over the country and from abroad worked on that plant. There is a dark side to that development, however, in that the cost was over the original budget. There were more strikes during the building of Marino Point than during the building of any other facility in the area for the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The problems that beset NET were due to the overrun in building costs and the accumulated losses in the early years of the operation up to mid-1987 which resulted in a debt of £165 million. After the amalgamation, NET was to service the debt. The source of its income was to be the management and purchase of gas from Bord Gáis at a favourable price that would enable the company to sell it at a profit and the dividends of IFI. However, matters did not work out as planned and there were many changes over the years in the commodities market. The entry of China and other eastern bloc countries to the fertiliser market resulted in the flop of this promising market. The price dropped as did the profits of IFI and it soon recorded losses. The dividends were reduced and eventually were non-existent. NET did not have the income which had been budgeted for to service the debt of £165 million which it took over in 1986. The debt built up until it reached £187 million which it is today.  The decision to sell was as a result of ICI divesting itself of its fertiliser arm. The board decided to sell the 51% stake held by the State and the 49% held by Richardson. There is no definite purchaser on the scene at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marino plant is one of the most modern, <Col N="36" /> up to date and efficient plants in the world. It provides top class, well paid employment in the Cobh area and for people living in the vicinity. The management has, with the co-operation of the work force, managed change in work practices over the years and brought in equipment. That is what ensured the survival of the company in difficult times.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years the company has brought great economic benefit to the area and has been involved in social projects. It provided funding for the development of the millennium park in Cobh which was opened earlier this year. It has also provided funding to local communities and made its facilities available when necessary to people in the area. It has taken part in the local community, which is right and proper.</P>
    <P>NET has provided benefits to the local area, but it has also been a major source of income to Iarnród Éireann. This became apparent to people who were not aware of it during the strike in the summer when the Arklow plant was forced to close for a short period because trains were not travelling from Cobh to Arklow. Iarnród Éireann sources a significant amount of its income from the trains that run between the two plants. Approximately £70 million is circulated in the Cork, Arklow and Belfast districts through wages and payments to subcontractors and local suppliers to the plants in those areas. It is a significant contributor to local communities.</P>
    <P>The Irish agricultural industry has benefited from the NET plants. Farmers were able to get nitrogenous fertiliser products produced at home at reasonable prices. If NET did not exist, the agricultural industry would have been at the mercy of foreign producers and importers who could have determined the price of fertiliser. NET was able to control and maintain the price of fertiliser at a reasonable level over the years. The price of fertiliser products has fallen in the past number of years and this has had a detrimental effect on the finances of NET. Exports have been affected. Although the products were purchased, the company did not get a sufficient price for them. In addition, imports are cheaper and they are now able to compete with the indigenous product.</P>
    <P>The change in approach to environmental protection, particularly in the last number of years, and the greater awareness of problems associated with ground water and the pollution of rivers has brought about new thinking with regard to solving difficulties. Farmers now think about the amount of fertiliser that should be spread on land.</P>
    <P>In addition to the environmental aspect, set aside has affected the amount of fertiliser used and climate changes have also had an effect. The climate has been milder in recent years with longer autumns and milder winters. Grass is growing for longer and the amount of fertiliser needed is not as great as previously. The effect of these changes contributes to a static to declining market in Ireland. This is not a rosy picture, but <Col N="37" /> the fact that IFI is a low cost efficient producer, compared to the majority of European fertiliser operations, will ensure that it will survive and prosper in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Regarding the current stories about a sale, the immediate worries of the employees relate to the various issues mentioned already. They are important issues and I look forward to the Minister's response to the queries raised by members of the Opposition. One of the issues relates to job security. Many employees are worried about this because they do not know what will happen to their jobs in the years ahead, particularly if the plant is sold. They made representations to me about their employment conditions and whether they will change. The employees are anxious in that regard.</P>
    <P>The pension fund is another concern that was raised. However, on the basis of the legislation, there should be no worries in that regard. Discussions had commenced on an employee share ownership scheme. The employees also raised this matter and they want to know what is happening in that regard. They want to know if it has been put on the back burner or if discussions will progress until a final decision is made on whether the company is to be sold.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of purposes, including to provide for the transfer of the liabilities for the State sponsored debts of NET to the Minister for Finance. This is logical. The Bill also provides that the Worker Participation in State Enterprises Acts will not apply to NET in the event of any future sale by NET of the 51% shareholding in IFI. It is clear that the worker directors will continue to operate while the State holds a 51% shareholding in IFI.</P>
    <P>Another provision relates to the First Schedule of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990. This will allow the National Treasury Management Agency to take over paying the debt, if it comes into the hands of the Minister. This is a wise move. The NTMA since its conception by former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, has saved the State millions of pounds. The agency has great expertise in this area and it should manage more areas. Given the change in its remit as a result of the euro, it will have more capacity to deal with other debts in semi-State bodies, companies in which the State has a 51% shareholding or local authorities. It is the ideal agency to deal with this matter and it is a good provision.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Marino Point and Arklow factories and other elements remaining in the control of the State. It may not be as important strategically as the refinery, but it is important that the agricultural sector has some control over an ingredient that is vital to the industry. I hope that IFI, which has proved to be efficient and profitable, despite the millstone put around its neck from the start, will continue to give a service to the agricultural community and provide good employment and social services to the people in the areas in which it is located.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. While I do not have the same in-depth knowledge as previous speakers from the Cork region, I wish to consider the Bill from a different perspective. The Bill allows for the transfer of liability for the State guaranteed debts of NET to the Department of Finance, which will allow for the management of the NET debt by the National Treasury Management Agency. That debt is now in the region of £187 million.</P>
      <P>NET was set up in very difficult times in 1961, first in Arklow and subsequently in Marino Point. It is interesting to note that, long before there was any talk of the peace dividend or the peace talks, in 1986, when Garret FitzGerald was Taoiseach, we saw the formation of a joint venture with ICI Richardson's fertiliser business in Belfast. This was truly a cross-Border project, long before the present peace talks. To its credit, that factory in Belfast employed staff from all communities during some very difficult times. The fact we have that linkage in the fertiliser, beef and dairy industries shows that a lot was happening on this island, in terms of people working together, long before the peace, for which some people in this House claim all the credit, took place.</P>
      <P>These are changing times in agriculture. The introduction of REPS a few years ago, the extensification grants from Brussels, set aside and the new area payments will continue to affect the usage of fertiliser. This will impede the increased production that is needed to decrease costs.</P>
      <P>TJ Maher, the former president of the IFA, always said one could go only two ways, forward or back. One cannot stand still. Unfortunately, an industry that does not have the opportunity to expand will certainly run into difficulties.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the purpose of this Bill is to try to put IFI into a position where it can be sold. The 630 workers and their protection must be taken into account first. While they are nowhere near my area, I feel their rights must be taken into account. However, my main worry about the possible sale of IFI is that it might be bought by a major outsider. Any industry in the hands of too few people, especially if it is totally dependent on people from outside the State to supply its needs, is very vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was the chairman of the national livestock committee of the IFA, a very beautiful lady, who was the agricultural attaché at the American embassy, went all around Ireland, including my county of Monaghan. She wined and dined us and advised us of the great value available in soya beans in her country. She said they could be sold for £120 a tonne on the Irish market and that no self-respecting Irish farmer should be without them. That was very welcome and allowed for a decrease in the price of the product at the time. The following year, however, there were weather problems in the US and neither the lovely lady from the embassy nor the soya bean mill could <Col N="39" /> be found. The price rocketed up to about £280 per tonne.</P>
    <P>I warn, with all due respect to the comments made by earlier speakers about the importance of this issue to the taxpayer, that if this is to be sold at a loss &ndash; which it will have to be because of its extremely high debts &ndash; we should ensure a group such as the IAWS controls it. This industry should remain in Irish hands and production should take place on this island. The implications of that not happening are extremely serious and there is no doubt farmers and the nation as a whole would be the losers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton, who is sitting beside me, was at a meeting of the agriculture committee this morning. He and others will bear me out on the fact that the bottom has fallen out of the cattle business. That will have further effects on the sales of Irish Fertiliser Industries. The price of cow beef, according to the Minister in his address to the committee this morning, has fallen by at least 30p per pound and steers have fallen by at least 10p per pound. If that was happening in any other industry, people would be at the gates of this House. We saw what happened with the taxi drivers yesterday. Farming folk are going through a serious crisis.</P>
    <P>The dairy sector has to become much more efficient. There will be fewer cows producing more milk to ensure that industry stays in line with its European and non-European counterparts. New Zealand and Australia can produce milk at a minimum cost and we must compete with them in the real world.</P>
    <P>The future for the industry is not great. We cannot allow this sector to be sold off at a very low price to a foreign company that might decide, regardless of its commitment to us, that the best reason for buying it would be to close it and gain access to that plant's markets without having to pay the workers or give any long-term commitment to this country.</P>
    <P>I met a member of the British Parliament the other day from Manchester who is dealing with a similar situation in that sector. An international company bought his local factory, which employed a lot of people. The day it bought the factory, it announced its closure. It bought the factory only for its sales book and nothing can be done about that. I warn the Minister that we should make every effort to ensure that does not happen here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of the debt to the National Treasury Management Agency. It has been successful in regard to our national debt and I hope it will be able to handle this matter better than it was handled by the company.</P>
    <P>I remind Members that this House was recalled to prop up the Allied Irish Bank which was in serious trouble. We saw it as a national institution that needed to be preserved. We did not get much thanks for that. In fact, we saw from the DIRT inquiry how that bank did anything but thank this House for its preservation in those difficult days. <Col N="40" /> The House was also recalled to ensure the Goodman group did not collapse. There is now an onus on the House to ensure, through this Bill, that NET and its associates in Belfast will continue to produce fertiliser in this country, that farmers will have a base to work from and that this industry will be preserved.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic. The real problem arises from the over-run of the initial cost. In the present climate most projects in which the State becomes involved, be it through the National Roads Authority or any other group, are completed on or before time and mainly within anticipated cost structures. In this instance there was a major delay in completing the project and a major increase in costs. This was compounded by external factors over which those involved had no control, such as a huge increase in interest charges. Those of us in the business can recall interest charges increasing in our ordinary businesses from 10% in the late 1970s and early 1980s to 22% or 23%. Given its level of debts, that must have had a serious impact on this company. Nevertheless, the situation must be addressed.</P>
    <P>In this House and other public fora much has been made of the virtues of being big in industry. Commitments and guarantees were made when Larry Goodman was trying to take over the dairy industry in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, but the farming community has benefited greatly from the failure of that enterprise. By contrast, when Avonmore and Waterford Co-Operatives came together to create Glanbia trouble ensued. I saw the consequences when I canvassed during the recent by-election in Tipperary South. Sizeable dairy units closed down because they had lost faith in the structures and no young people were prepared to come into the business.</P>
    <P>We in this House must ensure industries such as NET are in operation, not only for us but for future generations. They were established in hard times. We live in the commercial world and some people spend money as if there is no tomorrow while demanding that the taxpayers act as a safeguard when times become difficult. Nevertheless, jobs in this industry are important, as is the overall structure of the agricultural community. It is important, therefore, that we have some base for our raw materials.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister of State speak of his involvement. I do not depreciate his efforts in ensuring that NET could deliver all its products to the nearest railway station. It did not happen in Cavan-Monaghan and I wonder why. We must carry this very heavy, dense product in lorries for transport on completely inadequate roads. There is still no proper road structure from Arklow to Monaghan. That has caused unnecessary problems for the haulage industry and for farmers. Before the Minister of State leaves office, I hope he will establish a station in the Cavan-Monaghan region to ensure fertilisers can be delivered by some other mode of transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Crawford hopes for the return of the Great Northern or the Cavan to Leitrim railway lines.</P>
      <P>This short Bill allows for changes to the debt position of NET. It is proposed that it be taken over by the National Treasury Management Agency. When the NTMA was established the House was sceptical about its capabilities. However, it has proved itself well able to look after State borrowings. In this case it has taken responsibility for a sizeable borrowing. By 30 September, NET's total borrowings amounted to £187.2 million. This compares with total borrowing of £164.6 million in 1987. The company is to be complimented for ensuring its debts did not spiral, as happened with some other semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>We must be realistic and acknowledge that the Irish fertiliser market is small in terms of the global players. That is why the State established NET in 1961 as a semi-State company. However, a monopoly has been created. In practical terms, the fertiliser industry is, like the feed industry, a monopoly. Certain people control practically every aspect of it.</P>
      <P>We are now suffering with regard to costs. World commodity prices have been mentioned as a way to bring down the cost of inputs, yet this week some grain merchants and millers are trying to increase the prices of feed for livestock. Given that prices are falling that will have a detrimental effect. This situation has been caused by monopoly conditions because only a limited number of people have the resources or wherewithal to import large amounts of feed. Likewise it is questionable as to the number people who can secure port capacity for imports of product, whether it be in terms of shipping or storage facilities. Much of that is now controlled by one or two major companies. This is a dangerous precedent. Something will have to be done to enable greater numbers participate in this business.</P>
      <P>Certain people have a monopoly over imports of a number of concentrates because they can buy at lower prices without passing them on to the end customer. That is regrettable. People may use the strong dollar as a mechanism for justifying an increase in prices, but that should not happen. There should be a freeing up of this market and of the capacity for people to become involved in this business.</P>
      <P>In many cases fertiliser prices here are much higher than they are in Northern Ireland or England. When sterling and the punt were at parity there was a difference of between £10 and £15 per tonne with regard to certain fertilisers. This suggests there was no competition in the marketplace here. This is a small market and over the years the tonnage used has been in decline. It has been left to two or three groups to service it and without competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present operation, which is run by IFI, is probably much better run than when it was in the hands of a semi-State company. The fact that the State maintained a 51% shareholding illustrates <Col N="42" /> that when it went into partnership with ICI it had the interests of workers and people at heart. However, nobody has made an acceptable approach to take over the business. Is this because the industry was established 40 years ago and it probably needs considerable reinvestment to be able to compete on a global market or is it because the Irish market is seen as too small? This should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be possible to revamp the old plants which have been in existence since the 1960s and bring them up to modern standards. That would require substantial investment but the net value to the end user would be considerable. There is a global market for nitrogen and other products but our prices have always been higher than those in other countries. We all accept that our production costs are probably slightly higher as well. The monopoly has meant that Irish farmers have not been able to benefit from cheaper nitrogen which might be available in oil producing countries. That point has been proven in recent years.</P>
    <P>The decision to hand over the financial management of NET's debt to the National Treasury Management Agency is a positive one which will lead to better management of the debt and less cost to the State. I welcome anything which saves the State making interest payments. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I know how important it is to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and to his constituency.</P>
      <P>I have spent a long time examining the affairs of NET and its related companies. It has a chequered history. It generated great hope at the beginning. I remember as a young boy being led to believe that the State would get involved on the basis that a twin-track approach was required. We badly needed jobs and we were importing a large tonnage of fertilisers for cash, which was bad news for the economy. When agricultural production started 30 or 40 years ago, this was seen as important in reducing import costs. It was believed at the time that we should be able to supply a product which would help to increase our agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this House understands what happened. For some strange reason, every possible problem that could befall NET did so. I will not apportion blame but it gave State run industries a bad name at the time. Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta was lumped in with Iarnród Éireann and others at that time. Its management did not seem to be focused and it had little to do with competition. We are paying the price for that since then. It is true that in recent years it has had a break through IFI and at least its borrowings have not escalated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State knows as well as I do that there is a fundamental problem. It reminds me of the sugar company in Tuam many years ago. We did everything in our power to ensure it would be <Col N="43" /> kept open because it was important for our area. However, we were beaten by economic arguments and world trends. I hope that does not happen to NET in Arklow. I am afraid this change through the National Treasury Management Agency is the beginning of the end. It is not in the interests of the farming community or of the areas in Cork and Arklow. I hope greater efforts are made to ensure it is better focused on the market.</P>
    <P>If 6% or 7% of a total borrowing of £187.2 million is paid in interest, that means approximately £10 million, £12 million or £13 million must be paid each year to keep it ticking over. That is a huge drain on any company, particularly at a time when the use of fertilisers is decreasing from 1.9 million tonnes to approximately 1.5 million tonnes. I assume nitrogen would account for 50% or 60% of that total. That is a huge albatross for a company to carry around its neck.</P>
    <P>I know the National Treasury Management Agency does a good job and it has recourse to foreign borrowings. I assume that whatever else happens, the cost of the borrowing requirement for NET through that system will be lower than it would be if the company looked after it. That is good management by the Government which I support. However, I do not like the underlying trend.</P>
    <P>I telephoned a fertiliser distributor this morning because I was told there was a huge increase in fertiliser prices this year. I had not taken much notice of it because it is not the time of the year to spread fertiliser. However, I was not prepared for what I was told. If I had bought nitrogen and had it delivered this day last year in my home village of Mountbellew I would have paid £120, but that figure has now increased to £155. The same is true for other fertilisers, such as 10:10:20 and 8:6:12. Their prices have increased by between £25 and £40 a tonne.</P>
    <P>The price of the dollar and the cost of oil have contributed to the increases. I know there is nothing NET in Arklow can do if oil prices increase. However, I thought the gas merger would have helped to stabilise the unit cost. I know what will happen. The cost of fertiliser, when it is distributed from Arklow throughout the country next spring, will not be any different from the cost of imported fertiliser. The reason is the fertiliser industry is not competitive. We have not been able to compete with our imports. I do not know who we should blame for that or even if it is possible to compete. If we want a thriving fertiliser industry, we must be able to beat all comers. It is like the banks. Unless we can export our goods we will always be under the finger of the big international operators because of the small size of our domestic market. I am not sufficiently involved in this business to know if it is possible for the fertiliser industry to take on every operator which imports goods into this country.</P>
    <P>I became worried when I heard the boss of IAWS say only a year ago that his company was <Col N="44" /> not interested in NET. Mr. Lynch and his people have an eye for companies which might not be doing well but which, through their managerial ability, could be turned around. They have studied the European fertiliser business. I do not want to be a prophet of doom because I want an Irish fertiliser industry. It makes good sense to have it. If we are not careful, there will be a parallel situation in NET to the National Petroleum Corporation in Cork which the Government is now about to sell off on the basis that it has outlived its usefulness and one could get the product cheaper anywhere else. I am long enough in the House, as is the Minister of State, to know that this was a great white hope only 15 or 20 years ago and that we hoped to have it for reserves of the supply of petroleum in case of a shortage of product. We now know that if there is a problem with oil supplies worldwide, we are hit two or three days later. It is as simple as that. It appears that we do not have the ability to have the level of supply in reserve one would like, to tide us over three or four weeks, for instance, if we are faced with a problem of that nature.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the fertiliser area, it appears that we are at a crossroads because from what I know of it, ICI said it will only stay in it for a year or two. If it transpired that it decided to pull out for the reasons I have already expressed, then the company would be very open to market forces. One could see that a wind down might happen extremely quickly. If I was an employee of Nítrigin Éireann in Arklow or elsewhere I would be extremely worried about the current situation. I am sure they are and that the Minister of State is hearing that from his constituents regularly. I have no doubt that everything will be done to try to keep the industry there because, in my view, this is a national issue. One hopes that it will, despite the fact that the emphasis on production agriculture has now waned in the sense that, as everybody here knows, we are now talking about organic foods, curbs on production, the environment, etc. Nevertheless as a plant grows, it uses nutrients and we have no other way of replacing those nutrients than by the old means, the organic means and by artificial fertilisers. No matter how the scientists look at it, we will always need artificial fertilisers if we are to keep production up. It is how we use them that makes the difference.</P>
    <P>Against that background there will always be a great need for a fertiliser industry and because of the expertise that NET acquired over the years and now has, it appears it is in the best position to spearhead it. Its past is coming back to haunt it though. The question of the overruns, which I remember from many years ago, was a scandal where any set of figures given for the completion of a particular job was never met. The situation was out of control.</P>
    <P>However, we have a fertiliser industry that is very important nationally. If it is bought for the wrong reasons, if a buyer is interested in it only to ensure that its company on the continent or elsewhere will have an open market for its prod<Col N="45" /> uct, that will not be good for Irish farmers or for buinesss. I sincerely hope the Government will keep a very close eye on that and that everything will be done to try to get the type of buyer, at whatever cost, who will have a commitment to Ireland, to the farming community of Ireland and to the workers who make up that industry. In so far as this Bill is concerned, this is a mechanical exercise really. The National Treasury Management Agency is the right conduit to handle this because of their expertise. However, this is only a symptom and I greatly fear for the future of this industry unless the Government becomes more proactive and lets the good points of the industry be known because it certainly has not received a good press.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This company has a debt of £180 million and the treasury is checking over it. What will happen now is that this company will look for a buyer. It should try to get someone who will protect the industry and jobs. This is very important. The jobs should be protected and we should not be dependent on imports of fertiliser. This is an agricultural country. I am not a farmer but I listen to farmers daily complaining about the cost of fertiliser. There is no doubt that if we lose this company, we will lose our national industry and we will be dependent on supplies from other countries. This is not good. We saw what happened recently in relation to BSE and the products we were importing to feed our cattle. The problem developed because farmers were buying something but did not know where or how it was produced. That industry has been in difficulty in past years because of this disease.</P>
      <P>It is important that we protect this industry and the staff. If a buyer is found, we must ensure the company will protect the jobs. That is what this is all about. The jobs should be protected. I do not see why the people who have worked for that company and given loyal service should be worried and upset now. Many of them are concerned about the future of this company. It is important we make sure that whatever can be done will be done to protect this industry.</P>
      <P>Farmers are complaining daily about the price of fertiliser. With all the restrictions, county councils throughout the State now tell farmers that, in some cases, they will have to apply for planning permission to spread fertiliser. This is a step too far and the time has come for us, the Irish Government and Parliament, to put down the foot in Europe. This is a step too far. Farmers have always been good at looking after the environment. As regards farmers and landowners, there has always been a tradition that land is passed on to the son or the daughter. Farmers are not people who like to abuse land or abuse their own profession. It is outrageous that farmers must obtain planning permission from the county council in order to spread fertiliser on their land. If anybody had suggested 30 or 40 years ago that this would happen in rural Ireland, they would have been laughed at. I do not know where it will all end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Last Monday night, I attended a public meeting in Newport in connection with farmers who are trying to supplement their income from the sea, but the whole Clew Bay area is to be sterilised in the context of special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas. One wonders what that has to do with the Bill, but it all relates to what is happening in this country at the moment. Ministers should be honest and tell farmers whether Governments want them to stay in the business of farming or to get out so that reservations can be created in the west. Then there would be no need for fertiliser. We fought hard, and people gave their lives to get independence. People here have always had a love of the land and a love of agriculture. However, daily we see rules and regulations from Europe which prevent farmers from farming and from putting fertiliser on the land. Now this is moving to the sea where farmers supplement their income by fishing, and there will be restrictions on what they can do. Europe wants to isolate and freeze all these areas. What is the hidden agenda? We used to have landlords from England at one time. Now we have landlords from Europe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to set up a forum comparable to the civic forum in Northern Ireland. As the Deputy is aware, both the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum are already in place here to advise on economic and social matters. Both of these bodies are closely linked to the social partnership process and include social partnership representation. The NESF, in particular, has a very wide and representative membership of more than 60 people representing all areas of the community and is designed to help achieve a shared understanding and to build consensus on social and economic issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is vital the impression that the Government in the South has one law for Unionism and another law for itself be removed, whether we are talking about the killers of Garda McCabe or policing reform? Does the Taoiseach welcome, for example, Garda Commissioner Byrne's statement that he would not have any problems with reforms which would see independent Garda investigations being carried out in this jurisdiction? Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation sub-committee on obstacles to peace in the South, which is currently in abeyance, could provide a very useful vehicle through which the issue of the establishment of a civic forum in the South could be examined? The sub-committee has unfinished business and such an examination would not place a huge additional burden on the structures of the State. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that there would be merit in trying to mirror developments in the North with similar developments here which would comply with the parity of esteem principle which the civic forum would represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked four questions, the first of which is not relevant to this issue. However, I welcome the Garda Commissioner's remarks. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has acknowledged that independent investigations would be useful and the Government is prepared to consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of groups have suggested that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should be reconvened in some format to carry out some of the work envisaged for a civic forum. If one compares the civic forum in the North with the fora we have here, the differences are few. Our fora do not include churches in the strict sense but CORI is the representative body in this area. The <Col N="48" /> issue of victims is the only issue which is not covered by our bodies. Various groups have pointed out that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could perhaps examine this matter. I have not entered into any discussions on the matter but I have been asked to consider it although I have not yet said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In terms of the North-South consultative forum which stems from the Good Friday Agreement, it is envisaged that consideration should be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum which would be appointed by the two Administrations. The forum, which would be representative of civic society, would comprise social partners and people with expertise on social, cultural, economic and other issues. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also contains a commitment that the Government will work towards agreement with the Northern side on the establishment and effective functioning of an independent North-South consultative forum.</P>
    <P>At the second plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council which was held some weeks ago, it was unanimously agreed to initiate a study on the establishment of a consultative forum which would be appointed by the two Administrations. It was agreed that a working group of officials from both Administrations and from the North-South Ministerial Council joint secretariat would be established to examine the matter and report on it to the next meeting which is scheduled for March. The Northern Ireland Civic Forum which was established in recent weeks has stated its willingness to work with that body on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn was probably the first person to put the idea into my head that it would be easier and more efficient to add on to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body rather than set up an entirely new structure. We did that but the Unionists were the only people who failed to attend the body's recent meeting. Neither were the Unionists prepared to participate in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. We cannot be accused of not being helpful but we will do all we can to overcome the difficulties which exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the achievement of the twin objectives of peace and reconciliation and the cementing of the peace which has been established since the negotiation and endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement requires more than the order of Government and politics but also requires the concentrated effort and work of civic society? Does he agree that the establishment of a civic forum in the Republic, working in conjunction with the civic forum in Northern Ireland, would greatly help strengthen the work of peace and reconciliation in society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach's view on the establishment of a specific course on peace studies in our curriculum, which would examine the variety of traditions and cultures on the island? What is his view and what action has the Government taken on setting up the new parliamentary tier envis<Col N="49" /> aged in the Agreement between the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I said I thought the idea of a civic forum is very good. We effectively have such a forum, except for the area I mentioned. In the North there is no body. We have representatives of the Oireachtas, all parties, the social pillars, business, trade unions, farming, NGOs, and a range of organisations from the fourth pillar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Their focus is entirely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Their focus is not entirely different. Many of the reports carried out by the NESF, for example, examine specific measures and programmes to achieve equality and social inclusion and it considers expert reports put forward by all the relevant Departments and agencies. The civic forum in the North examines equality, opportunity, openness&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These words have a different meanings in practice in the South and in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not have a different meaning. In my efforts to encourage people in the North in terms of their civic forum, the meanings are precisely the same. That is why the forum in the North has representatives of business, agriculture, fishing, trade unions, voluntary, community and church groups and representatives of the arts, the same areas as here. We are trying to get away from having different meanings and move towards having the same understanding.</P>
      <P>Some of our third level institutions, not to mind Glencree, have looked at this and have already done useful work over the years in very difficult times which everybody commends. While they should continue this work, the Deputy is suggesting there should be peace chairs in the third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>At all tiers of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps. Certainly it should form part of the civics course in schools. George Mitchell suggested a chair of peace studies, and I am supportive of that. Some graduates under the George Mitchell scholarships are involved in peace and reconciliation work and perhaps that will be extended. There is no chair of peace studies in the third level institutions.</P>
      <P>Regarding the parliamentary tier, I answered that question last week. We moved to set up the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body to include the Council of the Isles with our colleagues from the other devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It has to be more formalised. Since answering Deputy Quinn's question last week I have asked the co-chairs if they will finalise the formal arrangements before their next meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="50" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters arise from the Taoiseach's replies. I welcome Commissioner Byrne's support for an independent complaints procedure based on the Patten report, and his endorsement of the Labour Party's policy published last Thursday. Is it the intention of the Government to bring forward legislation in the near future to establish such an independent body in view of the dissatisfaction which members of the public have with the current system?</P>
      <P>On foot of the points made by Deputies Sargent and Hayes, does the Taoiseach agree it would be worth while to formally ask the chairperson of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation if in her view there is merit in that body completing the reports, which were at a penultimate stage, in relation to barriers to reconciliation, even though there is no formal Unionist representation on that body? In the light of the current situation it would be useful and I ask the Taoiseach to communicate formally with the chairperson to ask her opinion as to whether there is a willingness to complete that task and publish the report.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, the co-chairs of the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body will agree to the fusion of their body with the Council of the Isles and not have a parallel organisation. There is neither the time nor the resources in absolute terms to have two parallel bodies. Of the two, would the Taoiseach consider that the Council of the Isles, involving parliamentarians from Edinburgh, Cardiff, the Isle of Man, Stormont, Westminster and Leinster House is of infinitely greater value than a body confined to Westminster and Leinster House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed the comments of Commissioner Byrne, which were helpful. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said the Government will examine it to see how that can be done. A reference has been made to the fact that it should be examined in the context of the Garda Síochána legislation, but no decision has been made on that yet.</P>
      <P>A number of times over the past 18 months I referred to the chairperson of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on this matter and will do so again. I would like to see the work completed and I have continued to carry it forward in our subheads on that basis. The difficulties on the last occasion related not necessarily to parties but to other pressures and issues. I will raise the matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that at its September meeting the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body invited the other parliamentary bodies and devolved Assemblies to become members, although not full members. They had observer status and were allowed to be involved in the debate and make presentations. When I attended they were involved in the question and answer session, but they were not present in a formal sense. The Unionists did not attend, something I hope we can overcome, but other than that it <Col N="51" /> worked very well. The members were anxious to participate and were interested.</P>
    <P>I agree that they should become formal members and that another secretariat and structure ought not to be envisaged. From talking to the two co-chairs in preparation from that meeting their view was that this was a wise way of proceeding and that if the parliamentarians from Westminster and the Oireachtas agreed they would not have a difficulty with it. My understanding is that the meeting that weekend went very well. I have asked them to put the formal mechanisms in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has said he is considering the request to reconvene &ndash; as I understand from his reply &ndash; the sub-committee of the forum for peace and reconciliation dealing with obstacles to peace in the South. Does he agree it would be of considerable interest to Unionists if that body were reconvened to finish its work and to consider the establishment, if appropriate, of a civic forum in the South? Will he acknowledge that many Unionists did partake in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation at the time and their presence and contribution should be acknowledged? It included people such as Gordon Wilson and many individual Unionists. There could be a misunderstanding if their contribution was not acknowledged here today. Given that there are such differences between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in relation to the civic forum idea in the South, does the Taoiseach agree it should be left for consideration in the interim to the forum sub-committee to deal with the issues, and the various interpretations of those issues, so that its recommendations can, at least, form the basis of a civic response to the issue rather than it being decided by parliamentarians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any great difference, but I want to make two replies. Many groups from Northern Ireland attended those Friday meetings and made many useful contributions to the deliberations of the forum. Of course I recognise that. When I say Unionists, I am talking about the leadership and their representatives. I should say, not in any sense of argument but to give a factual response, the Unionists political leadership did not wish to take part in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. It has not yet indicated its desire to take its place on the British-Irish Parliamentary Body or on the reform basis, as Deputy Quinn put it today. Without going into the details &ndash; I ask the Deputy not to ask me to go into them &ndash; I would have moved much further at the last session of the Ministerial Council, where I outlined what I was prepared to do, except for one group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that sectarianism is alive and well on this island and that we need to confront it at the earliest possible <Col N="52" /> age? In particular, as Deputy Hayes suggested, we need to confront young people at primary and second level with the existence of another tradition on this island. People of a Nationalist tradition, to which the overwhelming majority of people on this side of the Border belong, should be confronted at an early age with the existence of another tradition. These different preconceptions about sovereignty and different views of history would help people understand there are two legitimate points of view. Does the Taoiseach agree that is necessary? Does he further agree that the good work done, particularly by a former Minister for Education, Padraig Faulkner, in reforming the history curriculum is unfortunately being set at naught by the fact that so few students are studying history. Many young people can go through the education system with very little understanding of the fact that there are two points of view about history on this island. If we are to have genuine reconciliation of hearts and minds we must understand the other tradition. Despite all the structures being created for politicians to meet other politicians, we are not changing attitudes sufficiently at grassroots level and that has to start at the earliest possible age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about the education system is way outside the questions I am answering. On the broad question of reconciliation, this is a good place for politicians to start. The problem for many years was that there was no contact whatsoever. We went through two periods of almost 30 years with just the Lemass-O'Neill talks. There was practically no communication or intervention. Of all the business, farming and other bodies, trade unions probably have the best record on the island of working together down through the decades. The Congress of Trade Unions is an all-Ireland body. Even many of the sport and cultural bodies were divided but there are many all-Ireland bodies. That can be built up at every level. If it can be done in the education&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the question I asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, I do not think it has much relevance to where we are at this stage. If the question relates to whether the curriculum review body should look within the education system, that is a matter for the curriculum review body. Given that all young people are taught civics in school, the issue of reconciliation should be included. If I can give a purely personal view on history, I would not necessarily agree with Deputy Bruton' view. The difficulty is not that they believe there is an &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;them&rdquo;, they do not have any view on history. They do not consider that history is a great issue and it is not being taken up as a subject in school like years ago when people had a strong view one way or the other. History is not a major subject for students in either primary or second level schools. <Col N="53" /> If they had more knowledge of a balanced history, rather than little or no history, we would be better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When one has a view, at least it is something.</P>
      <P>It is a question of more reconciliation, starting younger and trying to get people to communicate and link together, the twinning of towns and children visiting other communities. I hate the term &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; but, unfortunately, that is what it means. I am in favour of people intertwining their activities and I spend quite some time, as do other politicians here, with many of the encounter groups, the across the frontier groups, the across the Border groups and the integrated education groups. I had a long discussion with Mo Mowlam recently about integrated education reviews on these issues and other bodies. All of this is useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that unless young people are given an understanding of the traditions and belief structures of the other community, they will not have an intellectual structure into which to fit the good experiences they may have on trips they make north of the Border? Therefore, it is very important to introduce, at primary and second level, a module of peace studies in an Irish context, dealing with peace between Unionism and Nationalism, understanding by Nationalists of Unionism and understanding by Unionists of Nationalism. Does the Taoiseach agree that is of primordial importance so far as advancing this issue is concerned at grassroots level and it is not something to be put in second place to contacts between politicians? Politicians can go only as far as their constituents will allow them. If the next generation of constituents of politicians on both sides of the Border are not being educated to have respect for the other tradition, we are building on sand. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his less than vigorous acceptance of the proposition I make to him, that we need to do something about this urgently at primary and second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. Deputy Bruton is answering my question by trying to put it another way, as if I am disagreeing. That is entirely unhelpful. I am not answering a question here about the curriculum report on what should be taught in primary schools. If that kind of co-operation and reconciliation is not built into the education system, the matter should be examined by those who design curriculum reforms and we should not give an off the top of the head reply to an off the top of the head comment. I am in favour of anything that will help to bring about reconciliation. Many organisations are working extremely hard on this but the Glencree group has done an enormous amount of work over many years. It has done a great deal of research on the projects which have been in place since <Col N="54" /> the 1970s. Work was also carried out by the Irish Congress of Trades Unions in the mid-1970s when people worked, trained and were educated together. Many resources are being put into these projects but we should ask the curriculum formation groups North and South to look at the education aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that there should be political responsibility for this issue. Politicians believe that not enough people from the North of Ireland visit the South of Ireland and <i>vice versa</i> and that something must be done about this. Will he accept that it should be the responsibility of the Government to put in place structured funding for outside peace organisations engaged in this work? Will he accept there is a responsibility on the Government to change the curriculum so that peace studies can be part of the national curriculum and that people understand the importance of reconciliation, not just an agreement between politicians but something which is practical and beneficial for our entire society? The Governments must take a lead in this area. Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the amount of Government funding over the past ten years in the area of peace and reconciliation is minuscule by comparison to the amount of money spent by the British Government per head of population? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many organisations and groups continue to receive funding. Perhaps it is not sufficient, but over the past 30 years this State has been very helpful to many groups and to young people who have come to this city since the troubles began in 1969. I am not saying this is sufficient, but we have been helpful.</P>
      <P>People have strong views on many issues, including integrated education, which is not a simple issue. Together with the Catholic church, I was involved recently in extensive discussions on the anti-discrimination and equality legislation with other minority churches, including the Methodist church, Presbyterian church and the Church of Ireland. The involvement of these churches with their communities is very important to them, and rightly so. This is very important in Northern Ireland if we are to make progress in reconciliation. This must be done in an inclusive manner, otherwise we will not achieve what is required. While violence was taking place, we were not prepared to engage in these issues. However, there is more openness now. The Government is prepared to support organisations involved in this work. It is not true that they have not been assisted in the past and we will continue to help them in the future.</P>

      <P>May I have a written reply to Question No. 15 which we will not reach today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While joining other Deputies in welcoming the comments of the Garda Commissioner in relation to investigations, does the Taoiseach see a role <Col N="55" /> for the civic fora in encouraging exchanges of police management and policemen, not just between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland when it is in place, but between police forces within these islands? There are many common problems, including xenophobia, racism and drugs problems in inner cities about which we could learn from each other, both on a management and patrolling level. Would the Taoiseach consider such exchanges between police forces within these islands useful, given that we already send gardaí to Amsterdam where they play a very useful role?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is already happening. Members of the Garda Síochána at different levels take part in training courses in the United Kingdom. Members of the RUC come to Templemore. RUC officers who did a good job in Kosovo were trained in Templemore. Given the experience of the RUC in relation to aspects of crime, including smuggling and gangsterism in Border areas, there is close co-operation between Sir Ronnie Flanagan and Commissioner Pat Byrne in this regard. Members of the Garda have studied inner city crime in college in the United States for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage a superintendent from the London Metropolitan Police being seconded to Dublin and <i>vice versa</i>? Does he envisage the same thing happening North and South on this island at patrolling level in terms of exchanging expertise and learning from each other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that the new police structures in Northern Ireland will allow for this. Commissioner Byrne and other senior members of the Garda have said they would not have any difficulty having closer co-operation with the police service of Northern Ireland. That would be a good thing. When all the differences are removed, crimes relating to drugs and other criminal activities will not be resolved unless the police forces work closely together.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the House on 26 October, I attended the third Asia-Europe meeting, or ASEM III, which took place in Seoul, Korea, from 19 to 21 October. I was accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, who was deputising for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>During the three closed sessions of the summit, leaders considered a range of topics related to the three strands of the ASEM process, namely, the promotion of political dialogue, economic and financial co-operation and co-operation in the cultural, educational, social and people to people fields. Leaders also discussed the future of ASEM at a working lunch between sessions on Friday, 20 October.</P>
      <P>During the summit, discussions naturally focused on developments on the Korean peninsula, and President Kim's recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize. While the dialogue between North and South was warmly welcomed, President Kim indicated that the greatest challenges remain ahead. As I informed the House on 26 October, copies of the Declaration for Peace in the Korean Peninsula, agreed by leaders at the summit, together with the chairman's statement summarising the conclusions of the summit and the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework 2000 agreed at the summit, have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regional security issues were discussed during the first session, on political dialogue, with developments in the western Balkans and the recent appointment of President Kostunica in the for<Col N="57" /> mer Republic of Yugoslavia, being of particular interest to our Asian partners.</P>
    <P>There was also a lengthy discussion on human rights. I pointed out that Ireland and the EU are fully committed to upholding the rights of the individual and, in particular, the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, association and religion. I also noted that we do not believe the enjoyment of these rights is dependent on the attainment of a particular level of socio-economic development by a state, but rather that they are the absolute minimum, to which all human beings are entitled.</P>
    <P>In discussions on the UN, I restated Ireland's support of Secretary General Annan's reform efforts. I noted also that the reform should be about making the UN more effective in the economic, social, humanitarian and other fields, and cannot simply be about cost cutting. I reaffirmed my belief that there is a need for the provision of increased levels of development assistance by wealthy nations.</P>
    <P>During the session on economic co-operation, the main discussions focused on multi-lateralism and the WTO, the knowledge based society, the impact of globalisation, the current price of oil, e-commerce and the Internet. It was clear from discussions that the majority of Asian countries present have made significant recoveries from the financial crisis over the past two years and are looking to the future with much greater optimism. We considered the possible measures which could be adopted to sustain long-term economic stability and prevent a recurrence of such economic crises, and also the role that the IMF can play in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the final working session, discussions focused on co-operation in cultural and other fields. I reminded leaders that Ireland was pleased to have had the opportunity to host the fourth Asia-Europe Young Leaders Symposium earlier this year in Limerick. I indicated also that under our Asia Strategy, Ireland will continue working to develop closer links in the educational and cultural area, in addition to building links in the trade, investment and economic fields.  </P>
    <P>I had informal discussions with all the Asian leaders during the ASEM summit. I took the opportunity to thank those members who expressed support for Ireland during our recent campaign for election to the UN Security Council. I also congratulated Prime Minister Goh, on Singapore's election to the Council.</P>
    <P>I had a brief meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair on Friday, 20 October when we discussed the ongoing work by officials in Dublin, London and Belfast, particularly in relation to the Ulster Unionist Council meeting of Saturday, 28 October.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to have an opportunity for a frank and informal discussion with President Wahid of Indonesia on the margins of the summit. He informed me of a new and ambitious plan to resolve the crisis of refugees in West Timor. President Wahid, together with the <Col N="58" /> East Timorese leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, and Mr. Sergio de Mello, the UN head of administration in East Timor, will visit one of the largest refugee camps in West Timor. President Wahid informed me that he intends to initiate a registration procedure, whereby refugees in West Timor will be asked if they wish to return to East Timor. Under his plan, those wishing to return will be given protection and secure passage home, while those who opt to stay in West Timor, will be moved to more appropriate and secure accommodation. I welcomed the President's plans and raised with him the need for early disarming and disbanding of militias in the area. I also assured him of our support to promote peace and stability throughout the region. I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen to monitor developments in this regard but unfortunately I must report that in a recent briefing given by Mr. Sergio de Mello in Geneva he indicated that, while he welcomed the thrust of President Wahid's proposals as outlined to me in Seoul, he was unaware of concrete steps having been taken to implement these proposals.</P>
    <P>I also had a formal bilateral meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji of China. Premier Zhu congratulated me on Ireland's election to the UN Security Council and indicated that China looked forward to working closely with us over the next two years. I thanked him for the hospitality and warm welcome afforded to the Tánaiste, and the trade delegation that accompanied her, during her recent visit to China. I invited Premier Zhu to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with President Kim, we discussed developments on the Korean peninsula. I encouraged President Kim to pursue his policy of openness and dialogue. The House will be aware that a small number of EU member states indicated their intention at ASEM, to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. There are, however, aspects of North Korea which remain of concern to us and other member states, particularly in the area of human rights. Accordingly, while I look forward to the eventual establishment of diplomatic relations, quantifiable progress will have to be made in a number of areas, particularly in human rights and non-proliferation, before any decision can be taken. I also took the opportunity to invite President Kim to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Together with the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, I attended a formal dinner hosted by President Kim Dae-jung on Friday evening. This afforded me an opportunity to have informal discussions with each of the Asian leaders and to raise Ireland's Asia strategy with them.</P>
    <P>Following the conclusion of the summit, I addressed a lunch attended by senior representatives of the Korean business and academic community, and members of the Irish community living in Korea. A copy of my speech has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. I was especially <Col N="59" /> pleased to be able to mark the occasion of the first visit to Korea by an Irish Taoiseach, by announcing a substantial donation of books to Kyung Hee University by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I also visited a language workshop organised by M.E.I. Relsa, launched a Korean language brochure on studying English in Ireland and attended the signing of an agreement between Changwon University and Trinity College Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of this ground has already been covered in debate. Did the Taoiseach raise with the Chinese leaders the position of the 10 million Roman Catholics in China who, because they continue to owe spiritual allegiance to the Pope, are not treated properly, are isolated in various ways and are subject to discrimination? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We covered a number of issues. The issue of religious persecution in general had been highlighted during that week, particularly with regard to a church which had been organising on the Internet. The view of the Premier Zhu Rongji was that the Chinese authorities have no wish to suppress religious groups and are prepared to move on religious and human rights freedoms in areas where they see no threat to the regime. They do not regard Catholicism as a threat but, unfortunately, all religious groups appear to be treated in the same way. There is major suppression of religious groups.</P>
      <P>Two years ago when I was in China I met Catholic priests who are still operating underground and are unable to say daily Mass. They were in great fear of travelling to meet me and careful arrangements had to be made for that. While I did not have lengthy discussions with Premier Zhu, I asked some of the officials to explain the reason for suppressing religion. They continually referred to the organisation which operates on the Internet and which they saw as a great threat. They did not distinguish between the Catholic Church and other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach on meeting the Chinese priests. It is greatly to his credit that he did so.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, in a misreading of history, the Chinese see Christian churches as precursors of colonialism? This is a completely out of date view of what Christian churches are trying to do in places like China. The Chinese must realise that this is a purely spiritual enterprise which has nothing to do with politics. I hope the Taoiseach will continue to take initiatives such as that on which I commended him a moment ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year the Chinese issued a policy document in which they incorporated a threat of force in relation to the integration of Taiwan in China. Did the Taoiseach make it <Col N="60" /> clear to the Chinese Premier that this threat of force is unacceptable to Ireland and the EU?</P>
      <P>The Beijing Government has laid down a one China pre-condition for any discussions. Did the Taoiseach make it clear that we do not accept Beijing's interpretation of one China which does not accord with the Taiwanese interpretation, which is one democratic China? Did the Taoiseach make it clear that we are in favour of one democratic China and that this should be the basis of discussions between Beijing and Taipei?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Having spent a number of days anchored off Barrow-in-Furness with a number of Korean nationals aboard the <i>MV Greenpeace</i>, I ask the Taoiseach was the issue of nuclear shipments between Japan and Sellafield, which are of great concern to people in Korea, mentioned at any level during the conference? Was the Prime Minister Mr. Blair involved in any of those discussions, considering the concern about this issue which is common to people in this country and in North and South Korea? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taipei and Beijing argument will not progress unless it is taken in the context of one democratic China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect that the earlier threatening noises do not have widespread support. Statements have been made by the Government in Taipei regarding what would be acceptable to it. The Taipei Government has indicated a willingness to move towards the Chinese view of how progress can be made through dialogue. It was the view of the conference that that position will allow more progress to be made. Premier Zhu Rongji is very anxious to make sure that it is done through peace and dialogue and not through any of the earlier hard-line threats. Deputy O'Keeffe knows that over the years when there is any indication from Taipei of an independence stance, a very tough and uncompromising line is taken. This country has always accepted the one China concept down through the decades. That is the only way things will move. Now investments from Taipei all over the region into mainland China are enormous. There has been huge investment and massive growth through the 1990s. Enormous wealth has been created in the Taipei region and it is in their interest as well to try to follow the road of dialogue. If the Deputy was listening, as I was &ndash; I did not strongly participate in that discussion for obvious reasons in that there were many to whom it is important &ndash; the Deputy would say they were trying to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the environment, I do not know if that issue was mentioned, but environmental issues generally were mentioned several times and by several speakers in the course of the conference, including how the seas are used, how industry is developed, the threats, the dangers and the cli<Col N="61" /> matic changes. All these issues were extensively discussed and debated and contributions were made. That was prior to the Hague meeting. Many of the countries were setting out their stalls and the position on which they would move in the Hague, which I am sure they have done.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself that sufficient electricity is available to supply peak-time demand over the coming months particularly in the context of the ESB's decision to lease five emergency generators from the United States of America at a cost of £10 million; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt in some detail with electricity supply in reply to a previous question on 19 October 2000. The situation is being carefully managed by the ESB and by Eirgrid and, as a consequence of this, customers have not suffered any disruption to supply. The chairman of the ESB has given me a categoric assurance that there will not be a shortfall in the electricity supply this winter.</P>
      <P>The ESB keeps my officials informed of capacity on a regular basis and, in turn, I am kept informed. The ESB recently encountered unexpected difficulties with one of its generating sets at its Poolbeg plant and with a smaller set at Shannonbridge. However, customers have not experienced any supply interruptions as a result of these unplanned outages. The localised power supply interruptions that have occurred resulted from various problems with the grid, including construction work interfering with electric cables. The smaller unit at Shannonbridge will take several months to repair but the larger unit at Poolbeg is undergoing urgent repair and will be back on stream early in the new year. The company's position is greatly helped by the mobile generators which it leased earlier this year and by the new IVO peat plant at Edenderry which I formally inaugurated on Monday of this week, 27 November. The ESB and Eirgrid will continue to manage capacity competently until a major tranche of additional capacity comes on stream.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> When we last had oral questions here we dealt with the £25 million mini-CTC mismanagement of public funds which is the subject of the next question tabled by Deputy Stagg. In relation to the five emergency generators leased from General Electric in the United States for six months at a cost of £10 million, is £10 million the actual cost? What is the cost of the five emergency generators? Is it true that the ESB staff did not read the technical detail too closely with the result that the quoted figure of <Col N="62" /> £10 million for the leasing reflects the initial payment only and that a second £10 million had to be paid as soon as the equipment was installed on the site? </P>
      <P>Did the engineers in question not read the detail of the fuel specification too closely? Is it not true that they assumed diesel was the fuel to be used and that only recently have they discovered that to meet the technical requirements of the fuel specification, the ESB will now have to supply aero kerosene as the fuel at considerably increased cost if it has to switch on the generators? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information on any of the three points the Deputy raised because they are entirely technical. I will find out all the details, including the cost of the five generators. The Deputy asked if the ESB staff did not read the instructions. I have no idea, but I will ask if they did not. The Deputy asked if the engineer in question was not aware of his job brief or whatever in regard to the generating capacities. On all of those points, I will inquire of the ESB and will have it contact the Deputy directly with the replies.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> In relation to further details of the project itself, the five generators which have been installed for more than two months &ndash; the period in question is October to March &ndash; have any of the generators been brought into use as of now? Are they simply lying idle &ndash; two in Killala, County Mayo, and three in Aghada in Cork? Does the Minister not accept that there is a manifest lack of planning here? If we have to bring in five generators from the United States at a cost of £10 million or £20 million &ndash; I said £20 million because that is my information &ndash; does it not show a manifest lack of planning and foresight by virtue of the fact that there are 38,000 new consumers coming on stream every year and there is a 6% increase in demand for electricity and yet at the end of the day, we simply do not have adequate generation capacity in the grid to supply the minimum needs of the country and that we have to resort to these very expensive emergency measures to ensure that supply is augmented if necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very pleased with the ESB for taking the emergency measures needed. The Deputy talked about engineers and technical details and I will have the ESB reply to <Col N="63" /> him directly on them. The ESB has supplied me with a figure of £10 million for the purposes of a Dáil answer. I can only assume it is telling me the truth. If the Deputy says it is £20 million, I will get the ESB to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The House should know that the unit three at Poolbeg, which is out of commission, is down for a 12 week overhaul. A major problem has occurred there. This has a 270 megawatt capacity outturn, so it is a major supplier. A major problem has occurred with the welding in the boiler tubes. The outside contractor has accepted full responsibility for the problem and he will bear the full cost of putting it right. The ESB aims to have the unit operational again by the end of December or in early January. It would seem it was most prudent of the ESB to make those standby arrangements.</P>

      <P>I was informed by officials in my Department on 2 November 1999 of their concerns in relation to delays and contractual difficulties on the mini-CTC project. I was informed that one of the contractors involved had been taken over and that there had been a restructuring within the companies involved which had already led to delays and cost overruns. My officials informed me that it had been hoped these difficulties had been overcome but that it was now evident that this was not the case. I was further informed that Iarnród Éireann was attempting to resolve the contractual issues which had arisen with the contractors on the mini-CTC project. I asked clearly to be informed of developments.</P>
      <P>My Department agreed with CIE that an independent evaluation should be carried out in relation to the ongoing contractual difficulties. In January 2000 my Department stopped a payment of EU funds in respect of this project because of its concerns about the ongoing delays and contractual difficulties. On 28 January my Department was advised by CIE that legal advice had been sought and that Iarnród Éireann was re-assessing the project with the assistance of external experts.</P>
      <P>PricewaterhouseCoopers was engaged by CIE on 24 January 2000 to carry out an external review of the project and I was informed of same. My Department received a copy of its report on 21 September 2000. Following receipt of this report and the serious questions it raised in relation to the management of the mini-CTC project, I referred the matter to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the mini-CTC project regarding signalling and the improved safety of the rail track which has an overrun from the original £14 million to somewhere in the region of £50 million. Is the Minister aware that the assistant secretary of her Department told the committee he became aware of the problems with this contract in October 1998, that he was seriously concerned about it in April 1999, that he informed his Secretary General between April and November 1999 and he informed the Minister in 1999? Does she agree that she discussed rail safety on several occasions in this House after November 1999 and never made reference to this problem of which she had been made aware? Does she also agree that she informed the House on 19 October 2000 that she was not made aware of this problem &ndash; the record shows that is what she said &ndash; until September 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Mr. Fearon said he informed the Minister in November 1999 &ndash; he told that to the committee on 26 October. There is a gap of a year between what the Minister told the House on the last occasion and what she is saying today. I would like the Minister to clarify that. I do not want any more fudging or covering up on this issue. She should come clean and be clear on it. On the last day she said it was September 2000 that she informed the House, today she is saying it was November 1999.</P>

      <P>I received the report, after several protracted requests for same, of PricewaterhouseCoopers on 21 September which was a very full evaluation and description of the whole event. I received, as I said clearly, a telephone call at the end of October at my clinic in Athlone on Saturday afternoon from a technical person with very full information. I asked the official and he provided me with an interim report which stated there were concerns but there was no clear delineation of the extra costs. I continued to request it. I understand that a decision was taken at the board meeting that there should be an outside professional evaluation &ndash; I am glad of that &ndash; and PricewaterhouseCoopers was employed to carry it out. When that was put in train we had to await the outcome.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call in my clinic in the summer informing me in a very technical way about the project and that there would be a much greater overrun than had been envisaged earlier. I said I must await the report. I requested and received the report on September 21 and it is being considered by the committee.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that her answer is disingenuous in the extreme? We know what she said in the House the last day before she knew Mr. Fearon was going to spill the beans on her a few days later at the committee. She is now withdrawing her statement of 19 October and replacing it with the evidence of Mr. Fearon. I am glad she is putting the record straight.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House why, given that she knew about this crisis for a full year before it was raised by Deputy Jim Higgins during Question Time on the last occasion, she sat on the issue and did not do something about it? Why did she not take corrective action? She was informed about it a full year before she took any action. Does she agree she only took action when Deputy Higgins raised this hot potato in the House and that she tried to kick to touch by asking the committee to consider it? If the Minister thought that was the correct course of action, why did she not take it as soon as the matter was brought to her attention by Mr. Fearon and the Secretary General of her Department, according to their evidence?</P>

      <P>In 1997, I received a letter from a UK based engineering company seeking financial support for a feasibility study into the proposed construction of an immersed tube tunnel between Ireland and the United Kingdom. The proposal was referred to the technical assistance committee of the operational programme for transport to consider whether it had merit.</P>
      <P>The committee concluded that an Irish Sea tunnel was unlikely to generate revenues to remunerate costs in the foreseeable future and that financial assistance should not be provided for the proposed feasibility study. This information was conveyed to the company concerned in June 1998.</P>
      <P>An Irish company, Islink Limited, which is based in Raheny, Dublin, was in touch with me concerning another proposal for a surface rail link between Ireland and Britain using a different technology. However, the technology concerned, which is based on floating structures as distinct from a tunnel, is very much experimental and unproven. This view was conveyed to Islink at a meeting in the Department earlier this year.</P>

      <Quest>the progress that has been made with regard to the introduction of competition in the provision of public transport in the Dublin area; and if she will specifically allude to the operation of Luas, the procurement and operation of the proposed metro and the break up of CIE prior to the introduction of competition in the bus sector.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In early September I published a Government consultative paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport. This document set out proposals for institutional and regulatory reform and invited public comment on them. These proposals have been generally welcomed by respondents to the public consultation. I have also consulted the social partners on the proposals through the public transport partnership forum.</P>
      <P>In the meantime my Department is proceeding with the wide range of detailed background work required to flesh out the framework set out in the consultation paper. The public transport area of my Department has been restructured and an additional assistant secretary and staff have been assigned. My Department is also working within the current regulatory regime to increase private participation in the expansion of bus services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>In July, 11 additional licences were announced for the greater Dublin area and the Minister of State and I have developed and revised more liberal guidelines for the licensing of bus services in the greater Dublin area. Subject to consultation with the public transport partnership forum and the Attorney General, I hope to announce a licensing round under these revised guidelines shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has engaged consultants to design and conduct a competition for the selection of an operator for Luas lines A, B and C. The consultants recently submitted their report to the Department with recommendations on how the competition should be structured and conducted. We hope the operator will be selected by <Col N="69" /> October 2001 when the first trams for the three lines will be delivered.</P>
    <P>My Department recently circulated draft heads of a Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill which will establish a new State agency with responsibility for the procurement of rail based public transport infrastructure projects, including the metro, on a public/private partnership basis. Prior to the establishment of this agency, the light rail project office has been given the task of beginning preliminary planning for the metro.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the documents on the future regulatory framework and the previous suggestion that there should be competition in the greater Dublin area only after the privatisation of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, has the Minister changed her mind? Does she still regard that as the best way forward, particularly in view of the case yesterday involving Bus Éireann? It did not have enough buses to provide a service between Dublin and Galway but it hired extra buses and offered a free service to the public to force a private competitor off the route.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister contested the case. How can she stand over such an action which is completely against the public interest? It is a totally blatant abuse of power by a monopoly operator. Would this type of behaviour on the part of Bus Éireann not give her pause for thought about proceeding with a situation where there may be two giants competing against each other in the future? Does the Minister agree it would be better to allow real competition to grow and to allow smaller competitors into the market? They could establish themselves and grow and provide real competition for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to talk about the court case. Regarding competition, 11 additional licences are now available and there will be much wider licensing within the next two months, subject to the agreement of the Attorney General and the forum next week. This is in line with the 1932 guidelines. The 1932 Act needs to be changed, but we must work under it until it is amended.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the rail safety Bill and the legislation regarding the railway infrastructure. The next step is to establish a regulatory authority which will take over the issuing of new licences from the Minister and the Department. The legislation is almost finalised. It is obvious that other methods of transport inadvertently suffered because they did not have a firm legislative base. Therefore, I intend to introduce legislation even if in some cases it appears to be slow in coming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was aware of that meeting. Both Ministers told me prior to a Cabinet meeting that they were to have such a meeting. <Col N="72" /> The Minister, Deputy Harney, is entitled to say anything she wishes at a meeting. I told both Ministers that I would reflect on section 46 prior to Committee Stage, which is the answer I gave in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me about Gormanstown. My information was that this related only to Gormanstown. I also met with that group &ndash; its members were in the gallery of the House one day &ndash; prior to the meeting with the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith. I gave them the answer I am giving the Deputy &ndash; that I will reflect on it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her apology. However, since she has used the word &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; today and on previous occasions, will she reflect on how badly her Minister of State was briefed on the previous occasion?</P>
      <P>Does she agree that during a previous Question Time she said she would reflect on whether to drop section 46, which deals with Baldonnel, or ensure it referred only to Gormanstown? Is she in a position to give us an indication of her reflection on that?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that not only did the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, meet the Baldonnel group, he also wrote to it and said that in the immediate future he would not be in favour of civil aircraft at Baldonnel? Does she agree with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me three questions. I thank him for accepting my apology. I said on Question Time that day that I would reflect on whether it would be done by deleting the section or by clarifying that it referred to Gormanstown. I had hoped that Committee Stage would be taken prior to Christmas. It does not appear now that that will happen, so I will have further time for reflection. I have not made up my mind.</P>
      <P>I knew the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Tánaiste would meet the residents. They asked me my position and I sent them the extract from the Official Report of that Question Time. I did not know there had been a follow-up letter.</P>

I am sure the Minister is aware of that. Could we have a copy of the expert and up-to-date studies that indicated that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the red alert and Poolbeg. I read out the background note on Poolbeg. It was most unfortunate what happened there. The major problem there occurred with welding in the boiler tubes. The outside contractor has accepted full responsibility for the problem. The ESB aims to have that unit operational again by the end of December or early January. Deputy Stagg will be glad to know, because he was involved in the IVO in Edenderry &ndash; and I am delighted Deputy Dukes accepted the invitation to come along to it &ndash; that that has come onstream into the grid exactly six months ahead of schedule, which was a remarkable achievement. It will provide 122 megawatts to the grid.</P>
      <P>If a person tells me something, I usually take him at his word. The chairman of the ESB gave me a categoric assurance that there would not be a shortfall this winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We have more time for supplementaries on this question as the Minister did not use her time to read the reply because she had already answered it. Does the Minister agree that the benefit of the Europeat station has already been wiped out by the shortfalls that have been described? Does she agree we are now reduced to hauling circus generators around the country to try to keep lights going?</P>
      <P>The reason this occurred is that since 1997 the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was requested to authorise the ESB to proceed with the Ringsend plant. The ESB proceeded to seek planning permission without her approval or despite her lack of approval. She withheld capital approval and gas was not allocated to this new station until last month. They could not proceed because of that. At all stages, the Minister blocked the ESB from building the power station. It will be two years before that station is complete. We will have two more winters to get over&mdash;</P>

Is she not also aware that this is a relatively industrialised country using a transmission system designed primarily for an agricultural economy?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, is she not aware that many inward investment projects are effectively barred from large parts of the country? For example, no industrial projects of any significance can be located in a line west of Cavan to Galway because of inadequate supply in the grid.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>On 27 September last the Government approved the introduction in 2001 of a radon remediation grant scheme. A sum of £1.559 million has been allocated to my Department's Vote in respect of the scheme in 2001. The purpose of the scheme is to assist householders who have high levels of radon in their houses to undertake the necessary radon remediation works.</P>
      <P>The precise details of the scheme have yet to be finalised. However, it is envisaged that the grant scheme, which will commence in the latter half of 2001 and wind up in 2010, will be administered by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The scheme will apply to private and local authority houses and to houses provided by voluntary housing organisations. Grant assistance will represent 50% of the total cost of the remediation work, subject to a maximum grant of £800 per household.</P>
      <P>The specific details of the scheme will be settled by a steering committee comprising my Department, the Departments of Finance, Environment and Local Government and the RPII. I expect to announce details of the scheme in the new year. The scheme will be up and running in the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that for some time I had sought Government funding for such a grant scheme. I hope it will provide an incentive to householders with high radon concentration levels in their homes to undertake the appropriate remediation works. I am happy to acknowledge the work of the former Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, on the scheme prior to my taking office. We were happy to build on that work and I am satisfied the funding has been put in place. I also acknowledge the robust support of my senior colleague, the Minster for Public Enterprise, in achieving that funding.</P>

Is the scheme he is now preparing similar to the one I had prepared before I left office and which his senior colleagues had abandoned? Does he have figures on the number of people who died from the effect of radon gas? It is calculated that 300 people per year died from the gas since the Government took up office and since the Minister and her senior colleagues abolished the scheme that was in place, despite the best efforts of the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The scheme has built on the work done when Deputy Stagg was Minister of State and in many ways it is similar to the one he proposed. The details will be worked out speedily and it will be up and running soon. I do not have substantive figures on the information sought by the Deputy. The RPII has advocated this grant scheme and has expressed serious concern about radon and the potential health hazards involved. There is a huge level of awareness throughout the country and a degree of urgency about the scheme within the Government. That will be a big incentive to people to proceed with remedial works.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and for the fact that money will be available. Given that my home town of Moville has one of the highest concentrations of radon, will the scheme be focused primarily on those areas that have high radon levels in accordance with the study undertaken? Last week I received a reply to a parliamentary question on schools, especially with regard to my own areas of Buncrana and Carndonagh, which have exceptionally high levels of radon. Is the Minister of State satisfied that the works to be undertaken immediately will be adequate?</P>
      <P>People have been advised to place a radon detector in their houses. Is that an adequate response for towns that have been designated as high radon areas? The Minister of State referred to the present and potential health risks and Deputy Stagg referred to the 300 deaths from radon related illnesses. Is there a need for more research and, perhaps, pilot projects which could take an area, such as my home town, to study the larger ramifications of radon on the environment and health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's area is a high radon area, as established in the survey undertaken by the RPII. It is expected that such areas will be addressed under this scheme. A public awareness <Col N="79" /> campaign is under way to advise and exhort people in those areas to partake of the scheme and become involved.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to schools is ongoing, as is the survey. Remediation works have already commenced and the Department of Education and Science is funding them. All schools deemed to be above the national level of 200 becquerels will be dealt with and the works will be carried out. The first phase of that scheme has been fully completed and I understand the second phase is expected to be completed in the current year. Work will continue thereafter.</P>
      <P>As regards the third matter the Deputy raised, the RPII is continually monitoring this situation. It will keep us well informed on the subject.</P>

      <P>The amount of Exchequer subvention for CIE, as published in the abridged Estimates for the year 2001, is £159,060,000. The subvention is paid to CIE rather than to the individual companies in respect of the provision of socially necessary, non-commercial public transport services.

Will the Minister specify, when making the subvention available to CIE, that Dublin Bus should be subvented or that part of the money should be available for the pur<Col N="80" /> chase of new buses? Is this money only for ongoing revenue costs within CIE or is it capital as well? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £159,060,000 is for subvention. There is a capital budget for the provision of buses and trains. The 1986 legislation, by which it is now governed, states that the money is paid to the board which then allocates it. The increase in funding is more than 40%. I do not hear any words of congratulations about that, but it led to table thumping.</P>

      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>)<b>:</b> £159,060,000 is a large tranche of money. Does the Minister agree, however, that irrespective of the sum of money we provide, unless we get a stable industrial relations climate in the company it is all for naught? Does she also accept that the leaking of a sensitive document on rail safety and ILDA's allegations from the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission is unhelpful in the context of industrial relations negotiations, particularly when titanic efforts are being made to keep the ship on an even keel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy Stagg's question, I am aware of the chairman's statement in the annual report that the board will seek an increase in fares. However, I have met the chairman and I have told him there will not be a fares increase. I am sure the subvention will be sufficient but permission will not be given for a fares increase.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the industrial relations climate. That is why I went on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; because that was the morning the Estimates were published and £1.6 billion was being given to rail services. It is clear we cannot have the current industrial relations situation. I pay tribute to both the management and the employees, particularly John Keenan, Noel Dowling, Tony Tobin and Liam Tobin who worked day and night over the past two weeks under extreme pressure to reach a result. The signalmen will vote on 22 December and the DART measures have been accepted. These people are again under the same pressure in relation to the level crossing keepers, which is another issue of contention. I do not know about the issue relating to the Labour Relations Commission as I do not interfere in its business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>If the directors in this company, which has many debts, worked for a private company, they would be sacked. What are the Department and the Government doing about them? Will they be dealt with? We should not reward people by keeping them in positions when they have failed. These people have created a <Col N="82" /> debt of £180 million and now the taxpayer must pick up the tab. That is not acceptable. If these people are not doing the job, action must be taken to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The banks give away umbrellas on a fine day but they take them away on a wet day. However, they were looked after and they got large interest payments from this company. That should not have happened. This company is owned by the State. The banks should not get interest and then a reward from the taxpayers. They pay DIRT on the one hand and then we give them back money for this company.</P>
      <P>This company should be managed properly. I want an alternative to the fertiliser industry. I hope that whatever the Government plans to do in the future it will appoint people who can run the company. However, it looks like we may have to sell it. We must be careful not to sell it to a non-national operation which will close it down. We will then have a monopoly in the fertiliser business. The farmers and the people will pay because there will not be competition.</P>
      <P>We have enough monopolies. The Government brings in European legislation relating to monopolies but our greatest monopoly is the Government. We have a monopoly with regard to the lotto machines. In parts of rural Ireland with a population base of below 50,000 or 60,000, the company will not provide the machines. What is the Government doing about it? Nothing. I have written to the director who has responsibility and the Commissioner with responsibility in Europe and have asked them to take a case against the Government. The people in rural Ireland are entitled to the same services as the people in Dublin City, Cork City or Galway City if the Government are giving licences to provide it. It is a little like the situation regarding TV3. I live in the west of Ireland and to this day TV3 has not provided the service. We are receiving TV3 through the illegal deflector system and it is only thanks to the community that we are receiving it. It is not a very good signal. TV3 gets a licence to provide the service nationally and all it covers is Galway City and the big cities and it leaves out rural Ireland. It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about the way the farmers have been treated by the EU and by the Government. The people who ran this company did not provide a good service for the State. It is sad now that the State has to pick up the tab. I ask the Minister and the officials what will happen with the directors? Are they to be rewarded with bigger jobs now that the NTMA is to run this company? When the day comes that this company is sold on, it will be like other companies. After they ran it into the ground, there will probably be big handouts paid for by the tax payer. It is not good enough and it is not right that we cannot do anything about people who worked for monopolies and for the State and did a bad job. On this occasion, the Government has to save the other jobs. The workers are the innocent victims in this matter again. If the company is to be sold, the <Col N="83" /> Government should ensure it is sold to an Irish person and we must be careful to make sure the jobs are maintained for the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Billy Timmins. I am very glad Deputy Timmins will have an opportunity to speak since he has represented the town of Arklow very well and will continue to do so for Fine Gael in the future. I too am a representative of County Wicklow and I am naturally enough concerned about the future of the IFI plant and in particular, the work force in Arklow. As other Deputies said, the history of NET is a very difficult one. The chronic financial debt overrun that built up to extremely high proportions has always been there as a cloud threatening the future of the Arklow plant. Inevitably the rationalisation experience reduced the work force dramatically. The work force now is at more than 600 people. However, the reduction in the past of the numbers at IFI had a significant impact on the prosperity of Arklow town and the hinterland of south Wicklow and north Wexford. Those job losses were compounded by job losses at the potteries and the closure of the mines at Avoca to such an extent that the town went into a period of serious decline. For years, Arklow was an unemployment blackspot. However, over the lifetime of the last Government, and in the time of this Government, infrastructural development and tourism related investment has transformed the town. It is designated now as a growth centre under the regional strategic planning guidelines. While the town is being restricted unfortunately by the inability of the urban district council to proceed with the planned sewage treatment plant, the future of Arklow, it is safe to say, is secure.</P>
      <P>I hope the future of the workers at IFI is as secure. Ever since its establishment, the economic life of the fertiliser factory and that of the town of Arklow have been inextricably linked. Today the interdependence is less pronounced. There is a greater level of industrial development generally which offers employment opportunities for people living not just in Arklow but in the south Wicklow hinterland. However, that said, the IFI plant is still a major employer. Some 630 workers are employed by the company. There has been considerable investment in plant facilities to bring it up to a par with other EU plants. It is now a very competitive and efficient plant. Significantly, confidence in the future of the plant is such that young workers have been taken on in recent times and have been trained up in-house. Recruitment is a good indicator that the company is intent on regenerating its work force which can only be an encouraging sign. While this Bill does not secure the future for the IFI plant and for these young workers, its provisions will rationalise the current legal framework and open up the next stage in the life of Arklow and of the operation in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to transfer the accumulated debt of NET to the Minister for Fin<Col N="84" /> ance. It also allows for the transfer by the Minister with responsibility for managing the debt to the National Treasury Management Agency. Most importantly, at local level, it opens up the opportunity for the sale by NET of the State's 51% shareholding in IFI at some point in the future. Along with the other measures in the Bill these arrangements will lead in time to the winding up of the holding company NET.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the joint venture company of IFI in 1986 was a major step in resolving the problems besetting them at the time but the cost has been considerable. The relationship between NET and the IFI company was complex but essentially a contractual arrangement. This in effect ended at the end of 1999. NET was a vehicle for supplying to IFI the natural gas which is the essential raw material for the process. Once that arrangement came to an end, the purpose was null and void in terms of the company itself.</P>
    <P>The company, at the moment, buys raw material from a number of sources but clearly the gas link with Scotland has importance for IFI in providing it with an assured supply. The company, despite this major debt that has been present for a considerable time now, has achieved viability in commercial terms. That needs to be put on the record. It required considerable investment and a certain sacrifice in terms of rationalisation but there is a greater confidence. As yet a suitable buyer has not been found. The State intends to sell off its share and ICI too intends to sell. ICI globally has been getting out of the fertiliser business and there is an objective there to withdraw. Change is coming and it is vital that when that sale occurs, the jobs and the future of the work force are secured. IFI had a stable performance in a business that is extremely cyclical, prone to very severe shifts and inherently unstable in many ways although its performance in the home market has been inestimable and two thirds of the business is internal. The future of IFI will have an impact on agriculture and any buyer must take the long-term view not just in terms of the needs of the company but the needs of the larger market it serves.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter of worker participation because under this Bill it inevitably will come to an end in terms of the set-up in NET. I commend the role of the worker directors. The principle of worker participation at decision-making level is an essential one. Currently, we are seeing the breakdown of industrial relations on a huge scale across important sectors of our economic life affecting entire swathes of Irish life from the taxi men to nurses, from teachers to railway workers and the pilots. Despite the fact that this Government is headed up by a Taoiseach who made his name as being good at labour relations and being the kind of person who could fix the problem when industrial relations ran into rocky patches, we currently have an extraordinary state of upheaval countrywide. It is not just about money or conditions.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson on health, I am very con<Col N="85" /> scious that in the hospital structure particularly, among professionals and health care workers providing essential services there is an alienation from the management structures within which they operate. That kind of social partnership does not just occur at the top. It is not just a matter of negotiating at the top, it is a matter of ensuring that it comes from the bottom up. The worker directors in NET are an important model of how things should be. For example, they played a very important role when the plant was threatened by the ILDA workers' strike, during which supply to the plant in Arklow was cut off. There was a close relationship between management and workers, and a very clear commitment to resolving a problem not of their own making, and much energy went in to doing what was generally perceived to be the impossible task of ensuring that supply was provided for IFI in Arklow. They went to Cork and did the business, and it was a very fine example of social partnership being not just about striking deals with Government or the various pillars of the social partnership structure, but about ensuring that people can work together in a good atmosphere and on a basis of trust.</P>
    <P>Deputies Joe Higgins and Pat Rabbitte spoke about the role of the banks and the history of the enormous debt which is still outstanding. The banks made extraordinary profits from debts arising in the 1980s and have done so ever since. In ways NET was a cash cow for the banks all through the years during which, it is now clear, many of the banks themselves were involved in ripping off the taxpayer. At a time when Arklow was on its knees in economic terms, the banks were leeching off the State both in legitimate ways and, as is now evident, in illegitimate ways as well. That is something we should not lose sight of.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Ahern refer earlier in a positive way to the role of Charles J. Haughey in terms of managing the national debt. To me, the image of a time when the Taoiseach of this country, a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, was living high on money that belonged to other people, supporting an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle, while in the town of Arklow a generation of young people were forced to leave their home place and work elsewhere because there was no work for them and no possibility of a future, provides a stark contrast which is something we should not lose sight of. Time can distance people's understanding of an experience. It is important that we have the reminders, the contrasts, the reality of the lives of people in Arklow at that time.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to make before handing over to Deputy Timmins is in relation to the cross-Border aspect of the work being done by IFI. This is not a new aspect. It now has quite a track record. It is enlightening to see, particularly since the Good Friday Agreement, how many connections are building up very rapidly between Northern Ireland and the Republic. There is an enthusiasm now in many areas of activity, <Col N="86" /> whether economic or otherwise &ndash; I am particularly conscious of the area of health &ndash; where the connections and the growth of cross-Border activity are speeding well ahead of the formal structures and policies being put in place as a consequence of work being done by the two Governments. Here we have a model that grew up out of necessity but also out of seeing that there was great benefit to be had by cross-Border connection and working together, and that is to the credit of everybody involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of year we become familiar with the main Christmas toy, whether it be the cabbage patch doll, the Barbie doll or whatever. Listening to my colleague, Deputy Ring, I could not help drawing the connection between fertiliser in Arklow and lotto machines in Westport. Maybe Deputy Ring will come up with a very innovative game some Christmas. There would be a good opening for him there.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, I welcome this Bill which will remove a psychological noose from around the neck of NET. When IFI was formed in 1987, NET retained the State guaranteed debt of £164 million on its balance sheet. As of 30 December this year the debt stands at £187 million.</P>
      <P>This joint venture took place in 1987. People have criticised it. However, at the time the deal was done in the company's best interests and was based on the best advice available. No generation or group of people has ever had a monopoly on wisdom. I am sure we are making some decisions today that in the future will be shown to have been incorrect. It would be wonderful if we lived in a Utopia where every decision we made bore fruit, be it in our personal or in our public lives. That is simply not the case. I reiterate that the people involved in that deal at the time did it in the company's best interests. The company was confident that it would clear the debt over a period. This did not happen, in the main due to increases in oil and gas prices.</P>
      <P>The Bill is relatively straightforward. It transfers the debt to the National Treasury. That is welcomed by the many people who work in the company; in the mid-1970s there were probably 1,100. The Minister worked there, and he is entitled to reflect on that when moving the Bill. There are not many people who get the opportunity to introduce a Bill in an area that had a very definite impact on them and in which they had a definite involvement, particularly a Bill with such a narrow focus as this one. Today between 130 and 150 people work in the company; I am not too sure about the numbers in Cobh. The workers in the plant are concerned that this debt has been hanging over their heads, and it seemed to be impacting upon them. From that point of view I welcome the fact that it is to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has sought to sell the State's shareholding in the company but has not been successful. The Minister said that there was some <Col N="87" /> interest, but that a deal was not worked out. There is a general acceptance among workers and management that a private buyer must be found for the plant. I hope the Minister can react to this process when market conditions are favourable. It is vital that that happens because much capital investment has gone into the plants in Belfast and Arklow.</P>
    <P>In the region of £15 million has been spent on making the plant in Arklow more environmentally friendly. An article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> by Anne Ryan recounting a tour of Wicklow referred to the fact that the IFI plant was a blight on the landscape. No one could argue with that. It was built prior to 1963. It is located in one of the most beautiful areas in the country, and it certainly is an eyesore. Short of growing oak trees, which would take 300 or 400 years to mature, I do not know what can be done about that. However, I call on the management of the company and on the Minister to use their influence to see whether anything can be done to make it visually a little more attractive.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes this Bill. We hope a buyer will be found in due course and that, although we cannot impose many restrictions on a new owner, the current workers will get a fair deal and that their employment will be protected. I am confident that will happen because they are an excellent workforce and IFI is part of the tradition of Arklow, like many other industries in towns. It is important to draw the distinction between the fruits of the endeavours of the current workforce and the debt that exists for historic reasons. I realise the Government is keeping the workforce informed of what is taking place.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I welcome the Bill. It is important that in the future we should have locally based industry that produces fertiliser. Having to import fertiliser because of difficulties in the company in the past has had a negative impact on the farming community because of increased prices for fertiliser. It is important to have a product that is commercially viable and to be able to compete with larger companies across the single market. I hope the company's affairs will be put in order and that it will have a bright future. I am confident that will happen before the lotto machine, to which Deputy Ring referred, arrives in Westport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I thank Deputies for their useful contributions and acknowledge the broad support the Bill has received from all sides of the House. The Bill's main purpose is to transfer NET's State guaranteed debt to the Minister for Finance and, while that does not relate directly to the manufacturing company, IFI, it is understandable that the future security of jobs there has arisen as one of the primary concerns in this debate. It is the Government's intention to seek a purchaser for <Col N="88" /> IFI who is committed to retaining and developing the company as a manufacturing facility and securing, as far as possible, the future of jobs at the company. Prior to any sale, all employment issues will be fully explored with IFI employees through the consultative committee which was formed at the time of the previous sale process and on which there is employee representation. As the board of NET will be part of any sale process, this will ensure that IFI worker directors will be kept fully informed of developments.</P>
      <P>The issue of the amount of interest paid by NET to financial institutions was also referred to. NET has always managed the debt to the best of its ability by obtaining the best cost of funds available. It should also be noted that a substantial amount of the interest payments made by NET were funded by income generated from the commercial arrangements between NET and IFI. NET has carried out its debt management role in a most professional manner over the years.</P>
      <P>Difficulties associated with the fertiliser industry, such as environmental challenges and international trade pressures, were acknowledged in the course of the debate. The fertiliser market is a cyclical one and fertiliser prices have been particularly low in recent years. It is hoped that the sale of IFI will become possible if there is a recovery in market prices.</P>
      <P>Following the Bill's enactment, it is intended to transfer NET's debt to the Minister for Finance who may, in turn, transfer responsibility to the NTMA to repay and-or manage the debt. NET will, therefore, be relieved of its debt. The majority of NET's State guaranteed debt was built up in the 1970s primarily as a result of large cost overruns during the construction of NET's Marino Point plant in Cork. At the time of the joint venture in 1987, NET, in its new capacity as the holding company for the State's 51% shareholding in IFI, retained the historically accumulated debt of £164.6 million. The debt, therefore, became that of the holding company, NET, not of the newly formed manufacturing company, IFI. Prior to 1987, NET itself had been the manufacturing company.</P>
      <P>It was hoped in 1987 that NET, through its 51% shareholding in IFI, would receive sufficient income to service and possibly repay some of the debt which NET has retained. However, while NET received profits from the sale of gas to IFI in addition to dividends from the company, these did not prove sufficient to fully service NET's debt. When the restructuring of NET's fertiliser manufacturing activities occurred in 1987, the debt which NET retained was effectively a State debt as the loans were State guaranteed. The total amount of debt has now reached £187.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most pressing reason for transferring responsibility for the management of the debt to the NTMA at this stage is that following the expiry of the gas agreement last December, NET no longer had income from profits from the sale of gas to IFI to meet its debt management com<Col N="89" /> mitments. The primary remaining responsibility of NET and its board, following the enactment of this Bill, will be to manage the State's 51% shareholding in IFI.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the joint venture in 1987, NET, which already had a long-term commercial contract in place with Bord Gáis Éireann for the purchase of gas, entered into a long-term commercial gas agreement with IFI under which NET sold its gas allocation on to IFI. The gas agreement between NET and IFI expired in December 1999. The agreement contained a commitment by IFI to pay NET £13.5 million when the termination date of the contract was reached. This payment has now been made. However, due to the pressure which this payment exerted on IFI's cash flow, both shareholders &ndash; ICI and NET &ndash; agreed each would make a loan of £6.75 million to IFI on strict commercial terms . The loan, which is at commercial interest rates, is repayable by October 2002.</P>
    <P>In my initial contribution to the debate on the Bill, I took the opportunity to acknowledge the excellent management and workforce, past and present, at the company, particularly at the Arklow plant. Having spent almost two decades of my life there, I was very <i>au fait</i> with the circumstances which prevailed there. I particularly compliment the current management and workforce on the huge improvements made in the company's operations, specifically in regard to environmental issues which were the subject of much concern in the hinterland of Arklow and further afield. People's appreciation of the major improvements made on environmental matters is tangible. I do not apologise to Deputy Rabbitte or anyone else for referring to these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Its prohibitive cost means that health insurance is not available to everyone. The manner in which the VHI, the main health care insurer in Ireland, is treating elderly people, who possibly pay the highest annual subscriptions, is quite disgraceful.</P>
      <P>A private nursing home recently applied to the VHI for nursing home cover. The majority of the people who would go into these homes for a two week period to convalesce would expect to be able to claim on their insurance. While it is Government policy to allow the private sector provide such homes, the main health insurer, with 1.5 million insured people, will not cover these homes until such time as certain things happen. The reply from the VHI to the person stated the VHI had carried out a review of convalescent care in 1997 and that it was decided at that time that the VHI would establish a new directory of convalescent homes and that all health board registered nursing homes should be invited to apply for inclusion in the directory. The criteria and procedures for selection were accordingly notified to all health board registered nursing homes in November 1998, two years ago. The criteria included evidence of current registration with the health board and that the home be capable of being inspected on the date of application. The selection procedure was open to all interested health board registered homes and it was decided to establish a directory which would run for three years, after which the process would start again and whereon the VHI would open the process to all new and existing nursing homes.</P>
      <P>It was stated that during the course of earlier research it was discovered that convalescent benefit for which VHI cover was available accounted for only 3% of nursing home insurance and that 97% of nursing home income arose from long-term and respite care. It was stated that VHI benefit was not available for long-term or respite care as its procedures are more geared towards the provision of acute care in acute facilities.</P>
      <P>The VHI in its reply also stated:</P>
      <P>We have received a number of applications after the closing date and we are unable to consider these applications as they arrived after the selective process was under way or indeed completed. There are 118 nursing homes currently approved to provide convalescent care to the VHI members. We are confident that these homes can provide the required service that our members are seeking and we will review our requirements for additional nursing homes prior to the expiry date of the current directory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the VHI made a decision that it will not revisit this area until 2002, four years <Col N="91" /> from November 1998. The Government decided nursing homes could and should be built by individuals on the basis the Government decided it would not build further homes for elderly people. There are thousands of people awaiting operations, many of whom are elderly and have paid subscriptions to the VHI. The main health insurer will not allow the new nursing homes to be inspected and put on the register. The VHI is a State agency, and a decision should be made to enter negotiations with it on reopening this matter and to instruct it to look at nursing homes which are coming on stream and which are providing badly needed respite care for many people who are looking for hospital beds and recuperating from hospital treatment. Currently, the VHI tells people to go to particular nursing homes and that they cannot go to one beside them. This is a monopoly.</P>
    <P>In his response I would like the Minister to outline the Government policy on risk equalisation. We are aware of what the VHI is doing and it seems it has partly written the Bill on the basis of negotiations and discussions it has had with the Department and the Ministers. The VHI wants an equalisation fund put in place so that the other main player in health insurance, BUPA, which has in the region of 180,000 clients, can subsidise the VHI which has 1.5 million clients. The VHI has convinced the Minister to provide for equalisation in the Bill. This is in the context of the VHI not allowing any new nursing homes onto its directory and the fact that the majority of people who are in the VHI and who need two weeks convalescent cover have been members of VHI since it was founded. Now that they want a little care the VHI is reneging in terms of providing cover for new nursing homes which are being built in line with Government policy. This is amazing and I would like the Minister to say if he will return to Government to re-examine the matter. Alternatively, is the Government prepared to play ball only on the basis of VHI rules and not the rules of the elected Members of the House, which seems to be the case?</P>
    <P>In the past three and a half years, since the Government came into office, 150,000 medical cards have been withdrawn from ordinary people. Is the Minister satisfied those people can afford VHI or BUPA cover? I and other Members know they cannot afford such cover. The allowable proportion of people who can have medical cards under the rules and regulations drawn up many years ago is 40%, while the current figure is 31%. In addition, the number of visits by people who had medical cards, and by their families, to doctors over the course of a year has dropped substantially as they cannot afford doctor and chemist costs. We are now providing the most inadequate health service ever, while the Department of Finance is awash with money.</P>
    <P>The State, VHI and BUPA look after health in the country. On a weekly basis in the region of five people come to my clinics who have had <Col N="92" /> medical cards withdrawn because the person's partner took up a part-time job, which he or she was encouraged to do. The result is that children are being neglected.</P>
    <P>The cost of health care to the State is enormous. Another group of people in the health care area are carers and home helps. We have been increasing and tampering with the amount of money paid to carers and are still nowhere near even half of what it would cost for a person to be cared for by the State in one of our homes. These people should be properly paid for the work they do. Home helps receive £3.50 per hour and the majority of them work twice the number of hours for which they are paid.</P>
    <P>Even though extra money has been put into the system in all health board areas, if extra hours are granted and extra people come in, another person's of hours are reduced. There are five different areas where health care is an enormous issue. There are hundreds and, perhaps, thousands of people who save the State a small fortune &ndash; carers and home helps &ndash; and are paid a pittance. Has the Minister had any influence with the Minister for Finance before he arrives to give his Budget Statement next week? Have the issues of medical cards, carer's allowance and home helps been addressed in a positive and substantial way so that those who are saving the State substantial amounts of money will be given the opportunity to have a decent living for the work they do? </P>
    <P>In the area of home health care the VHI has a monopoly. It has not done a bad job but it has had many problems over a period. We should not put ourselves into a position, as the Minister, Deputy Molloy, did &ndash; whenever he arrives back from Mexico &ndash; in dealing with deregulation in one area. Yet another Minister comes in here and, because of one particular organisation, ensures there is no deregulation and no fair play in relation to equalisation and equalisation risk in a situation where one company has 1.5 million insureds while another has fewer than 200,000 and has to make funds available to the larger company. How can the Government see its way to inserting such a provision in the Bill at a time when there is meant to be equal competition when we have been instructed by Europe to do things many of us do not like? I ask that these areas be taken on board. I hope the Minister will table amendments on Committee Stage to deal with this issue. I do not believe we should allow a sitution develop where there are different standards in different Departments for dealing with different issues. If we are prepared to go down the road of deregulation and make everything fair across the board from a competition point of view fairness should also apply in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the main insurance company should be allowed put a derogation on any new cover for new nursing homes being built throughout the length and breadth of the country. Unfortunately they are required, otherwise they would <Col N="93" /> not be built. How can it say that for four years it is putting a derogation on cover for new nursing homes? The people who live in that region, such as my home village of Kilmainham Wood, and who have paid voluntary health insurance for many years, are being told to come back in 2002 or 2003 when it will consider when to reopen the gates to cover new nursing homes. This is outrageous and disgraceful. The Minister should ask the chairman of the VHI what is going on and tell him that our constituents who have paid for cover want to go to their nearest home which has been registered by the health board under the rules and regulations approved by this House. However, the VHI say it does not want to know about these new homes until 2002 or 2003. Therefore, those who have paid most and received the least in the area of health cover from the VHI are being told they can go to one of 118 homes but it could be 50 miles away, but not the near one. That is not acceptable in the year 2000. I ask that the Minister and his Secretary-General to resolve this matter. If the Government informs the VHI of his views on this issue the matter will be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I welcome it as a timely and desirable Bill and compliment the Minister on tackling a subject which, at best, can be contentious and, at worst, can produce an unseemly war of words between the rival service providers. I welcome its introduction and I have only minor reservations about one or two of its provisions. It is said that the whole area of private health insurance will expand enormously in the coming years.</P>
      <P>We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg in regard to stress related illnesses here. I recall speaking with a Dutch hospital executive ten years ago. He told me that people were working themselves into hospital in his country. I smiled to myself and thought that, with our somewhat laid back approach to work, it could not happen in Ireland. However, the pace of life has increased out of all proportion in recent years. When we hear 15 year olds say the years are flying and that they have no time to do anything, we must sit up and take notice. People who had an easy and relaxed lifestyle a decade or two ago and who should today be in even a better state financially and otherwise and have less pressures, now find the cares of living and the pressures of society becoming quite intolerable. Unfortunately, unless there is a change in these trends, which is unlikely in the short-term, we are likely to see more people work themselves into hospital in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Celtic tiger has brought many benefits, the increase in house prices is said to take its toll on our population. Couples paying huge mortgages leave for work at 7 a.m. and return 12 or more hours later and have little time for relaxing at home or having a social life. The pace of life generally has increased considerably and <Col N="94" /> while it has benefits in increased national productivity, in time it will take its toll on the health of the nation.</P>
    <P>We are now encouraged to develop &ldquo;wellness&rdquo; within ourselves. There is a whole range of commercial services to help us achieve this. Often we do not have either the time or energy at the end of a working day to apply ourselves to it. Undoubtedly there will be a fall out from this in years to come. We are sowing the seeds of great problems in the future. This is not the fault of this or any Government. We are on an international merry-go-round in a world of ever diminishing size and no one seems to know how to slow it down; many do not even want to.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, is the first legislation arising from the White Paper on private health insurance and provides a blueprint to address the under-developed private insurance market, a key issue in regard to Ireland's competitiveness. I welcome the Minister's proposal to regulate this sector and provide certain safeguards, just as I welcome the opening up of the whole new private health care insurance market generally.</P>
    <P>BUPA was the first to come to this country and offer an alternative to the VHI, which had operated a monopoly. I have no doubt that others will arrive in the future and the Minister's proposal to regulate the sector is both timely and wise. I said before in this House, and it bears repeating, that I am not in favour of monopolies. They are inherently unfair and, as we have seen from other elements of the public service, they are not always effective. A realistic level of competition is healthy in any sector. This has been acknowledged by those operating services in a monopoly in the past. Were it not for the fact that private coach operators forced themselves into the market to the disquiet of CIE, students would still be paying the equivalent of a quarter of a week's wages just to travel home for a week-end. Could we have envisaged cheaper phone calls and speedier connections and repairs in the telephone system if there was still just one State operator? The same applies to air travel. Would we still be paying a small fortune to travel to London and other places were it not for the advent of Ryanair? I had a bad experience recently with Aer Lingus, but I will not discuss that issue now.</P>
    <P>The country is littered with services where providers had to get their act together when competition loomed on the horizon. There is now competition in the private health insurance market. As well as the nationwide insurers, limited services will be offered by employers, some of which could be very large. I note the Minister intends to regulate the situation where an employer pays the fees or charges incurred by employees in respect of hospital in-patient services and will be defined as a provider of health insurance.</P>
    <P>Professor Ray Kinsella of UCD gave this Bill a warm welcome. He said it paves the way for the kind of substantive reform of the whole health care system which is now imperative. The private <Col N="95" /> health care insurance market in Ireland is under developed. At present the products being offered are way behind what are available in Europe or the US. Effectively, all that consumers can buy is hospital cover. They cannot buy insurance cover for primary care, dental or occupational health care. In addition, the buoyant labour market is creating a significant demand from employers for a greater range of health benefits, occupational health programmes and other services such as child care and wellness management.</P>
    <P>Everyone would like to see the speedy implementation of the Bill and the other legislative and regulatory changes outlined in the White Paper which will facilitate the introduction of new products and services. When enacted, this Bill will pave the way for the launch of new products other than community-rated hospital plans such as primary care and occupational health care. As a result of market regulations, such as community rating, lifetime cover, open enrolment and tax relief on premiums, the commitments to which are reiterated in the White Paper, there is a substantial take-up of private health insurance in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Approximately 45% of the population is privately insured compared to between 12% and 15% in other European countries where the market is risk-rated. At present two companies are competing in the Irish health insurance market. Further competition in the marketplace is to be welcomed. Clarity regarding the regulatory environment guaranteeing market stability is essential to attract even more players. Any delay in processing legislation and revising the regulations will hinder the advent of other health insurers into the Irish market. As such, entrants are seeking certainty of market rules before making a final commitment to the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reaffirmation in the White Paper of the Government's commitment to community rating as the cornerstone of the Irish private health insurance system. Community rating makes it possible for people to afford effective health insurance throughout their lives. Ireland's community rated market has 45% market penetration for health insurance. While the risk-rated UK market, with four major health insurers, has only 12% penetration, risk equalisation, which spreads the cost of claims among insurers in proportion to their share of the market is the foundation stone of community rating according to all the experts, including actuaries from Ireland, the US, throughout Europe and Australia. It prevents new insurers from cherry picking the least risky subscribers, leaving the higher risks to existing insurers. If we are to look after all our people, particularly those who are vulnerable due to any one of a number of factors, then we must continue to embrace the philosophy of community rating.</P>
    <P>I note that BUPA is unhappy with this proposal but, while allowing it to operate in this country, we must also ensure it plays on the same <Col N="96" /> type of pitch as the insurer who operated here in the past. We need only look at the Dutch experience in the 1970s and 1980s when, due to the absence of risk equalisation, several insurers had to be saved from bankruptcy due to being caught in a premium spiral of a worsening risk pool and increasing premiums. Risk equalisation offers the most effective method of reducing cream skimming because it reduces the incentives for risk selection.</P>
    <P>The White Paper does not propose, however, that people who enter the health insurance market aged 35 and over may be levied an additional amount on top of the normal community rated premium. We must encourage people to take out health care insurance as early as possible in life. The more who participate in the scheme, the greater and cheaper the benefits for all. The proposal will also limit the ability of people who have never contributed to the health insurance fund from taking advantage of those who have contributed all their lives.</P>
    <P>I note that section 10 gives insurers entering the market the option to avail of a three year exemption from risk equalisation from the date of commencement. This is logical and there is a need to ensure that new insurers are not frightened away by what might potentially be an imbalanced clientele. This was originally envisaged as being for an 18 month period but it is now proposed as a three year exemption. To ensure competition it might need to be extended a little further.</P>
    <P>The question of tax relief is important. Success in enticing people to take out private health insurance depends on allowing tax relief on premiums. The White Paper states that the Government is committed to retaining tax relief for health insurance premiums. This is an important incentive which encourages people to join health insurance schemes, and I welcome its retention.</P>
    <P>Tax relief on other health insurance products, which are not community rated, including primary care and occupational health care, is not clearly stated in the White Paper. Tax relief should be provided to give an incentive to people to voluntarily fund their health care costs and to be more proactive in their overall health management. Tax relief for products such as primary care cover and occupational health care programmes will encourage people to buy these products which support a pro-active preventative approach to health management, including early treatment in cost-effective settings, health lifestyle awareness and health management programmes. This will have a positive impact on the public health system.</P>
    <P>To depart from the provisions of the Bill, I compliment the Minister and his predecessor on making constant inroads into hospital waiting lists. While there may be anomalous situations where people are waiting an inordinate length of time, there is a great improvement in the overall service. I touched on this some weeks ago when I noted the improvements in waiting lists at <Col N="97" /> Waterford Regional Hospital which had been reduced from 742 to 591, a fall of 151. This decrease is a continuation of a very welcome downward trend which I am confident will continue for the remainder of the year. The national figure is down by 5,000 to approximately 31,000 since the beginning of the year. This is a direct response to the additional resources which the Minister has ploughed into the service <i>via</i> the blitz on waiting lists announced last May.</P>
    <P>It bears repeating that the Government has invested an extra £1,500 million in health care since taking up office. This represents a 56% increase in the day to day resources in the services and this level of investment will be sustained. Health care was again one of the major items in the recently published Book of Estimates which shows that by the end of this year, the Government will have increased spending on health by almost 80% since coming to office. No one can say a reasonable proportion of the benefits of the improved economy is not being spent on health care. These figures are encouraging and are part of a countrywide trend. Things are still not good enough and the Minister is bringing about an improved situation daily, despite staff difficulties which are not within his control.</P>
    <P>The presentation of health statistics can sometimes be unnecessarily depressing. For instance, we are regularly told that one in every three of the population will contract some form of cancer in his or her lifetime and that one in five will die of the disease. Considering the morbid fear of this condition felt by most of the population, to the point that many cannot bring themselves to mention the word, could it not be pointed out that over 60% of the population will not contract the disease and that 80% will not die from it? This may not be the message the Department wishes to get across but outside of the necessity to give up smoking very few precautions can be taken to prevent the disease. There are means of early detection which should be availed of but this is not the message that is emphasised.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of smoking, I appeal to the Minister to redouble his efforts to get the no smoking message across to young people. There is no more depressing sight than young students leaving their schools and lighting up as soon as they reach the footpath. In this regard, young girls seem to be most at risk. It is time we had a concerted blockbuster of a campaign to convince young people that smoking, to use their own jargon, is just not cool. National names and personalities, preferably from among the idols of the younger generation, should be enlisted for this purpose and every effort made to wean the at-risk teenage population away from tobacco. This is not to forget the other and worse addictions of illicit drugs and alcohol, but tobacco addiction and the wider social disadvantages of smoking could be emphasised more. Whatever the cost it would be more than recouped in the hidden savings of unfilled hospital beds in the future. Apart from the real and desirable improvements to <Col N="98" /> health, the quality of our lives would be improved by the reduction in this unsocial habit.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Select Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, is making an in-depth analysis of the dangers of smoking. A number of months ago one of the biggest tobacco manufacturers in the United States, Philip Morris, issued a statement that smoking damages our health, despite saying the contrary for many years. The company did not do that because it suddenly became concerned about the health of people but because it and other tobacco companies had lost cases in the American courts and by putting out this warning it hoped to avoid being sued in the future. The Philip Morris company is concerned about its profits and not about the health of its customers. Cases are pending in this country but, to the best of my knowledge, no tobacco company here has said tobacco smoking is harmful although we are all agreed that it is. Measures to reduce smoking would help to bring about a reduction in hospital expenditure, with a comensurate benefit to health care insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals which will bring improvements to this important area of Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of previous speakers that we should try to ensure the passage of this legislation as quickly as possible. I agree with Deputy Farrelly that a broad range of issues is dealt with in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have serious differences with what Deputy Kenneally said about the section dealing with risk equalisation. Any Bill which is designed to encourage health insurance and to promote competition in the health insurance market must be welcomed. However, contained within these proposals is the Trojan horse of risk equalisation. Unless we are prepared to review the Bill's move towards risk equalisation we will help to bring about the death of competition in health insurance and ensure that no new competitors will come to the market. That would be a tragic mistake.</P>
      <P>It is the aspiration of everyone in the House and everyone involved with health policy to encourage competition in the health insurance market, to have strong companies providing health insurance and to make health insurance available to every citizen. The proposals for risk equalisation could destroy these aspirations.</P>
      <P>Earlier today in Leinster House I met the former Minister for Health and presidential candidate, Mr. Tom O'Higgins. It was he who, as Minister for Health, introduced private health insurance and established the mechanism for the VHI in the 1950s. The plan was farseeing and has proved worthwhile and effective. However, the Ireland of the new millennium will need a different set of guidelines for health policy and the health insurance market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every political party is addressing the health issue. We are now approaching a general election, <Col N="99" /> whether it takes place in six weeks, six months or two years. In recent weeks we have seen the proposed policies of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties. Private health insurance is at the core of those policies. The Government parties share the view the health insurance must be accessible to all.</P>
    <P>This legislation contains the possibility of killing off health insurance. Risk equalisation is a difficult concept. When the Select Committee on Health and Children discussed this issue some week ago members conceded that they found the idea of risk equalisation difficult to understand. Listening to speeches on the Government side it is easy to see how people are being confused. I suspect there is an element of deliberate confusion. We are allowing risk equalisation to be confused with community rating. Everyone in the House supports the concept of community rating, which means that customers of all ages pay the same premium. However, the notion is being spread that community rating is dependent on risk equalisation. Of course, that is not the case. Risk equalisation seems to be an extraordinary formula designed to provide a direct subsidy to one company &ndash; in this case, to the large company &ndash; from smaller companies. If I were to compare it to asking the credit union movement to subsidise the banks, I do not think I would be too far off the mark. In the Irish context, we are asking what is still a relatively small company, namely BUPA, to give a direct subsidy, on an annual basis, to the monopoly, the VHI. If we go further, we are asking a mutual society, which BUPA is &ndash; it is not profit making and is owned solely by its members &ndash; to subsidise and give a direct cash injection, on an annual basis, to the VHI. One would not have to be an astrologer to know that within the next few years, there is every prospect that the VHI will be privatised.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's proposals become law we will, in effect, be asking a non-profit making organisation, a mutual society, to directly subsidise what will be a private company. We are asking that the shareholders of that company be subsidised and that their profits be aided by this risk equalisation proposal. That is at the very core of what will happen. Perhaps we are failing to get that message across and I ask the Minister to take that on board in his response </P>
    <P>This will not divide the House on Second Stage because everybody supports the legislation but it will be the key issue on Committee Stage, and I know many of the Minister's colleagues share my view. It will cause political division in the House. However, I hope that between now and Committee Stage, the Minister and his officials will have further talks not only with the VHI, the major player, but with BUPA and that they will focus on the long-term interest of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reflect on the fact that since we introduced health insurance competition, apart from BUPA, no other competitor has entered the fray. There is a message in that. If <Col N="100" /> there was a large market and huge profits to be made, we would have more competition. The shadow of doubt in the marketplace and in the health insurance industry as a result of the threat of risk equalisation is the main reason we do not have more competition.</P>
    <P>Everybody supports more competition. It is not my role to speak for BUPA or to raise BUPA's concern. My role is to ensure health insurance thrives in this country and that we have a strong VHI and BUPA and many other strong companies. As previous speakers said in relation to this Bill and during the debate on the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, competition has helped to transform this country across a range of services, including transport. Competition has worked. The more competition we have in health insurance, the better. While the possibility of risk equalisation exists, we will not have competition in the Irish health insurance market. We will at best keep the minor player, BUPA, on side and at worse, nobody else will join the health insurance field and that would be a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>I wonder why such pressure is being applied to the Minister's Department to run with these proposals. I wonder where Deputy Kenneally got his figures on international experience because according to the evidence available to me, there is no clear international evidence that risk equalisation is necessary or that it works. I am aware that risk equalisation has been withdrawn from a number of states in the United States. Various actuaries, and I believe the Government's actuaries, Mercer, have said, there is no clear evidence one way or the other. That is from where we should be working. There is no clear evidence of the need for risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the whole purpose of this risk equalisation provision is simply to prop up the VHI in advance of its privatisation. One of the direct consequences of that would be to weaken the market. It is in the interest of the Minister, the Department and everybody in this House to strengthen the health insurance market and, hopefully, to reach a stage where every citizen will be able to afford private health insurance. If we are to have that aspiration, it is vital that competition is not only secured, but expanded and that a multiplicity of companies, products and services are available. Although we have been advised this need not necessarily come in over night, the provision of risk equalisation, as contained in the Bill and as is being addressed, mooted and, in some way, supported by the Minister's Department, is a Trojan horse that could kill off health insurance and leave us in the same position we were in a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>We should reflect on what competition has done to date, and it has been very limited competition. We are not talking about Ryanair <i>versus</i> Aer Lingus type of competition but about David and Goliath in terms of BUPA. Competition has reduced prices in the market and it has, in a very dynamic way, broadened the range of services and products available to the public. It has <Col N="101" /> resulted in a significant increase in the number of people availing of private health insurance. That number could increase dramatically but it will increase only if competition is retained and expanded.</P>
    <P>If health insurance is provided by four or five companies rather than by one or two, it will put pressure on all those companies to ensure their products are competitive, that the level of service available to customers is improved and that they are stable and financially sound. That is why, before Committee Stage, the Minister and his colleague must reflect on any proposals that will threaten competition.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation sounds like a fancy arithmetic term and, in a sense, it is. However, when one strips it down to what it really means, we are talking about a subsidy being paid by one insurance company to another &ndash; in this case, a subsidy being paid to a State company. How will that fit into European competition law? I am sure that has received consideration from the Minister's Department. It is something which goes against the grain of European competition law in that we have been advised there can be no State aid to companies. I wonder what the Minister has to say on that. This is clearly being pushed by one company. That is understandable. If I were on the board of that company I would favour risk equalisation because it ensures the strong get stronger and the less strong get weak and eventually fade away. If that is what we want, that is fine but it goes against what we should be trying to achieve. We do not have a public health service that can deliver the quality of service required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally referred to the constant political battles concerning hospital waiting lists and so on. We all concede extra money has been invested in the health services but there are still many problems. People are left on waiting lists not only for months but for years. That major problem must be addressed. As part of that, we must have a dynamic, competitive, modern system of health care insurance to help people move from total dependence on the taxpayer to the private health insurance market. We expected that competition would make a difference. The arrival of BUPA has helped and there is a significant increase in the number of people availing of private health care. However, we have not gone as far down that road as we should. We must aim for the total availability of private health insurance. We will not achieve that unless we have five or six companies in the market. Risk equalisation will blow that possibility out of the water.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally said that, without risk equalisation, there would be cherry picking. The new companies would take on younger people while it would be left to the established companies to look after older people and that would destabilise the market. That does not stand up. We have community rating. If a company has a good policy, product and a competitive pricing structure there is nothing to stop a person from joining it. <Col N="102" /> Community rating is preserved in this legislation as is the right of a person to move from one insurance company to another. If we did not have risk equalisation, companies would put forward the best array of products and service at the most competitive price. There is nothing to prevent a person moving to a company that offers a better service. We should not view this from the point of view of cherry picking but rather see risk equalisation as a measure that will stop companies offering dynamic new products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally referred to the academic arguments, mathematical formulas and international evidence to support risk equalisation. There is a strong counter-argument to that. Some States that had risk equalisation dropped it. The Government's actuaries said the case for or against risk equalisation has not been proven by actual experience. The well regarded Trinity economist, Seán Barrett, is on record as saying that he and Irish health economists would be opposed to the concept of risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Oireachtas joint committee and look forward to a full debate there. I ask the Minister to be cautious. The previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, could see the wood for the trees and that risk equalisation is fraught with danger. He gave it serious consideration and left it. I cannot guarantee that in five years' time there will not be any need for risk equalisation but the proposals in the Bill whereby risk equalisation can be slipped in overnight will blow competition out of the water and will stop any new entrant coming into the market. I do not want that to happen and neither, I am sure, does the Minister. I ask him to reflect cautiously and diligently on the proposal for risk equalisation and not introduce that Trojan horse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation comes on the back of other legislation dealing with health matters and informing the public on leading a healthy life so that people do not end up availing of the health services in their early years. Many people are now taking alternative options and leading the kind of life that will result in them living longer free from the risk of poor health.</P>
      <P>Education and recent legislation dealing with smoking, alcohol and drug abuse will encourage young people not to indulge in these activities. We have been successful in dealing with those issues to date but our success rate does not compare favourably with other countries and we could do much more through the education process to discourage those activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone involved in politics, not just at national but at local level, has seen major advances in medicine, new operations, procedures and the delivery of a health care system. Alongside that we have witnessed growing numbers of people on waiting lists wishing to access these new developments. While I respect the fact that the previous and present Ministers invested heavily in trying to reduce these lists, they have been with us for the past 20 years. It is fair to say <Col N="103" /> that every Government and Opposition in every election over those years has tried to make political capital out of what it would or do when in Government, but I do not want anybody to seek political advantage from this matter. We should be mature enough to acknowledge that there has been a growing health problem for the past 20 years and a growing problem in relation to the waiting lists. This problem has not been dealt with adequately, despite the money invested recently.</P>
    <P>I object to the current position which is unacceptable. I welcome the indication in recent Government announcements that the forthcoming budget will prioritise health and deal with the issue of waiting lists. This problem relates to personnel and the difficulty involved in recruiting many more consultants to deal with matters that arise daily in hospitals in terms of the delivery of proper health services to those who require them immediately.</P>
    <P>Against this backdrop, there has been the developing issue of health insurance. The 1994 Act opened up the market, which BUPA entered in 1996. However, it is unacceptable that during this period a two tier health system has developed. Under this system if one has private cover one can get immediate attention. A lady in my constituency who was waiting for a cataract operation was told in January 2000 that it would be March 2001 before anything could be done for her. However, her family clubbed together and came up with the amount of money required for the operation. She received private treatment and had her operation on 10 October 2000. Such a situation is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The cases in the hospital in Kilkenny are mirrored throughout the country. I am not being parochial, but we are all informed by what happens locally and I am informed by the incidents in Carlow-Kilkenny. In the gynaecology unit in Kilkenny recently, two public patients miscarried &ndash; one in the ante natal section of the ward and the other in a corridor. This is a Third World standard in a country in which there is plenty of money and much progress. There is huge economic development but, in parallel to such development, an elderly person was not served by the State &ndash; she was not given the proper health care she deserved. In addition, patients in the gynaecology unit are being left on trolleys in a corridor.</P>
    <P>In another part of the county, an entire ward in Kilcreene Hospital has been left idle. The Government invested in the maintenance and care of the building, but there is nothing in it. At the same time, elderly people are not being cared for properly during the winter months. One might say these examples are a health board management issue. However, that is not the case. It is an issue for the Government and the Department of Health and Children which should insist on better management.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric services have been run down in the <Col N="104" /> county and patients have been moved into the community with little or no support. The hospital in which they were once housed is being turned into another administrative centre. There has been a huge growth in administration centres in the South Eastern Health Board area &ndash; this has been replicated in other health boards &ndash; while hospital beds have been closed. I cannot marry this with the effort that is being made by the Government to invest more money in terms of personnel and health care infrastructure to deal with people who must be in hospital but who cannot afford private health insurance.</P>
    <P>I intend to insist during my time in the House that this problem is addressed. It requires urgent and immediate investment. We can enjoy today's economy because of the efforts of the generation that went before us. They got little pay but they put much blood, sweat and tears into building up the economy. We should respect their place in it and ensure that a proper and adequate health service is made available to them regardless of whether they have a medical card or VHI cover, although my comments refer in the main to public patients.</P>
    <P>I hoped the health insurance option would open up the market and give greater cover. I hoped it would educate people from a young age to ensure that they had the best possible health cover and to stick with it throughout their lives. I wish to declare a vested interest in that I have VHI cover. My experience is that it is something one must have, but the cost has shot through the roof. If there was greater competition in the market, many more people would take up the option of health cover. I commend the Minister for at least querying or holding off the 5.5% increase requested by VHI.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act opened up the market, which BUPA entered in 1996. This is the backdrop to this Bill. VHI has 1.5 million members while BUPA has 185,000 members. I am not making a case for BUPA, but I am using its name to illustrate the need to define the market and to identify the problems that will be created with the suggested contribution of £20 million by BUPA to VHI. Nine out of ten people are VHI subscribers while BUPA has 11% of the market. The underwriting profit of VHI was £52 million while BUPA did not even turn over half that amount. VHI offers 11 products while BUPA offers approximately four &ndash; it is growing its share of the market.</P>
    <P>If risk equalisation is introduced into the market now, the growth of that small company will be harmed and Ireland will not be attractive to the many other competitors that could set up operations here and offer a much greater range of services and products. In terms of what is offered by VHI and BUPA, the market is a shadow of what is offered in America and Europe. There should be many more products and more competition in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I support the general thrust of the Bill, with the exception of risk equalisation. Some 17 countries <Col N="105" /> were surveyed and analysed but those involved were unsure about risk equalisation and the issue was set aside in the effort to get greater competition in the market. I ask the Minister to consider the issue of risk equalisation, particularly in the context of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he should regard it as something he could do if there was instability in the market place, rather than something he is introducing right now to deal with a possible instability. It is only when companies introduce their products into the market place that we will begin to see the negative effects of that. However, we have not seen many negative effects since BUPA arrived in 1996. Therefore, rather than introduce this at the outset, the Minister should have it as a tool which could be introduced at a later stage if there is instability.</P>
    <P>The Government's general policy is that everyone should have access to affordable health insurance. My concern in that regard is for the elderly in our population. I do not believe there will be cherry picking. When the other elements in the Bill are put into place they will guarantee a level playing field for everyone. However, if equalisation is brought in on day one, the company with 11% of the market will have to subsidise the VHI to the tune of over £22 million. The Minister will have to address that.</P>
    <P>If a company has a guaranteed income of £22 million, it loses its focus and edge if it is not requested to work for its share of the market, provide the product, compete on price and draw a cross-section of the community into its membership. I do not accuse the company of that. However, the commercial reality is that a company with a soft touch income of £22 million loses its competitive edge because it becomes lazy.</P>
    <P>There is a need to encourage all those who can afford it to take out health cover, to encourage young people to focus on their health care and to take out insurance, and to ensure competition will deliver proper health cover to every section of the community at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>There is huge growth in this country in the business of providing homes for the elderly. That is to be welcomed because the ones I have experienced in my constituency and elsewhere in the south east region are providing a quality service and are inundated with requests from families to take more people. The number of people availing of such care is growing. This is now an accepted part of the culture. However, the costs of this patient care are soaring and now run at anywhere between £300 and £360 per week. Such costs place a huge financial burden on families.</P>
    <P>The subvention offered by the health boards is allocated in a number of ways. However, there should be only one approach to this &ndash; the cost of the bed, the cost of the care and a single subvention figure. Every family is entitled to that if they have to care for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Health insurance cover should be extended to care for the elderly. That can be achieved in cer<Col N="106" /> tain aspects of this Bill. We should not have to fight for the care of the elderly. It should be delivered immediately to families which have someone who is ill and of an age where they need to be taken into care.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provisions in this Bill, we should look at the current position in relation to subvention. The bureaucracy of the health boards in this regard can often be unhelpful to families. They can often prolong the agony, in terms of finding out the family's worth and income. I know they have to do quite a lot of that, however, the primary issue here is the care of the elderly person. That issue needs to be addressed urgently in the context of the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the fact that many people under psychiatric care are now being moved into the general community. Families are concerned about this. There are people in those units with alcohol and drug problems who are almost suicidal. We have witnessed the suicide of some patients while they have been in our care. We must deal with that in the context of this and other Bills and ensure that a quality service and quality care are available, with supports, for families which have to look after such a patient.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House, but I ask that the equalisation issue be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been following the debate on this Bill and much of the attention has focused on the risk equalisation aspect of it, which is right and proper. Over the past few days we have seen what happened as a result of the deregulation of taxis. That deregulation was required. There is a contradiction here, however, in relation to risk equalisation.</P>
      <P>There are two players in the Irish market at present, VHI and BUPA. BUPA only arrived in 1996. As Deputy McGuinness said, it has 11% of the market, yet it is expected to pay £20 million over three years to VHI, which has been established in the Irish market for a long time. With the buoyancy of the economy and the numbers entering the workforce over the past few years, it is understandable that VHI's profits have increased considerably, as has the volume of business for both insurers.</P>
      <P>However, competition could have a detrimental effect in regard to other insurers entering the market, because one would have anticipated four years after BUPA entered the market, particularly given the buoyancy of the so-called Celtic tiger economy, other insurers would have entered the Irish market. The Minister must ask his officials in the Department why other private insurers have not entered the market. The answer is staring us in the face &ndash; it is because of the risk equalisation factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That risk equalisation is being sustained in this Bill. The EU competition commissioner has taken various people to task over anti-competitive practices. Has the Department of Health and Children discussed this in the European context <Col N="107" /> with Commissioner Byrne and asked his advice on whether this is an acceptable practice? It seems this risk equalisation does not happen in other countries.</P>
    <P>I know the original concern of VHI was that the market would be cherry picked and it would be left with the older customers. Consideration must be given to how long the VHI has been established in the Irish market and its track record. I and my family have been members of the VHI for some time. It is not a question of people making comparisons between what VHI and BUPA charge, as they do with other consumer items. If people have an established record with the VHI they automatically include children in a group policy. There is enough business for both insurers and we should encourage others to enter the market.</P>
    <P>This debate has concentrated on the VHI, yet 31% of the population have medical cards. Deputy McGuinness referred to the two tier system and I am aware of the case of a man in his eighties with a medical card who went into hospital to have his hand removed because of gangrene in his fingers. He was released the following day, slipped on the yard at home and is now back in hospital because of a broken hip. If he had been insured by the VHI or BUPA he would have been detained in hospital after his operation for a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the hospital authorities to recognise a sense of fair play when treating people with medical cards, as they do with patients insured by the VHI and BUPA because they are paying customers. I welcome Fine Gael's policy document on health, which recommends a huge increase in the guidelines governing the allocation of medical cards to replace the poverty criteria which currently apply and which preclude many people from consideration under the medical card scheme. Many people with medical cards who believe they will not get the care and attention in hospital they require also take out insurance with the VHI or BUPA.</P>
    <P>The ageing population issue will have to be addressed by the Minister and the Department. In this context nursing homes subvention needs to be re-examined, including the process involved in assessing people. At present considerable discrepancies can arise between what people must pay and the maximum level of subvention. That causes severe financial hardship to many people. Often private nursing home residents find their savings eroded. This puts an invidious pressure on us as public representatives to have them transferred to the hospitals for the elderly under the control of the health boards.</P>
    <P>St. Ita's hospital for the elderly in Newcastlewest has a marvellous staff complement working in very difficult conditions. It has been seeking a 12 bed Alzheimer's unit for a considerable period. Ministers have love-bombed west Limerick recently. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, visited the hospital, fol<Col N="108" /> lowed by the Taoiseach and the Minister, yet we still await the allocation of the magical figure of £1.5 million to proceed with the unit. When Ministers visit hospitals there can be tendency to show them the best or most modern wards. On his visit to St. Ita's, the Minister was shown the antiquated conditions in the wards. Considerable improvement is required and I would like to see action on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of speech and language therapists in the country. Trinity College is the only institution involved in training them and it produces approximately 26 therapists each year. Speech and language therapy is a departmental service, yet many problems have arisen because of the lack of therapists. A special school in Newcastlewest with 30 children caters for a 20 mile radius. It has been without a speech and language therapist since Easter. The health board says it has advertised for therapists but it cannot get applicants. This reflects the national shortage. If Trinity College is only training a certain number of therapists each year it is necessary to advertise not only in Ireland, but in Australia, Canada and the UK. It is essential to deal with this matter imaginatively.</P>
    <P>Children who are disadvantaged with Down's syndrome, autism or other such disabilities are trying to get a chance in life without the benefit of a speech and language therapy. It is a shocking indictment of the country that it cannot provide such a resource. I urge the Minister to grasp this issue and to try to recruit therapists from abroad. I will be disappointed to have to revert to the principal of the school to which I have referred and advise that there is no solution to this problem. Much greater creativity is required in the Department.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider the dramatic expansion of the health service, especially with regard to the administration systems, where there appears to be a lot of empire building. Despite these developments there are no people at the coal face. The problems in recruiting nurses, especially in Dublin, is symptomatic of this.</P>

      <P>I will do so, but the Minster of State has been taking notes on my comments on speech and language therapy and the position in St. Ita's hospital. I hope he will stop the love bombing by Ministers of west Limerick and give us something tangible by making an immediate <Col N="109" /> allocation of £1.5 million. I am sorry for transgressing, a Leas Cheann-Comhairle, but there are many difficulties and it is incumbent on us to respond.</P>
      <P>We appear to be pumping money into the health care industry, yet there continues to be huge waiting lists, including those waiting for cataract operations, which is most important for elderly people. If a family clubs together, the person can get a cataract operation within one to two weeks. Yet a person could be waiting two years if they do not have the finance. An elderly person's dignity could be maintained if they could read again.</P>
      <P>I knew a person in her eighties who was almost blind. I was approached by her daughter, who was working on a part-time basis and could not look after her, to see if it would be possible to get her into the local hospital, St. Ita's. She was assessed and when the specialist for the elderly noticed she still had some sight, he sent her for further tests. She then had a cataract operation which gave her a new lease of life. It was not necessary for her to go into St. Ita's Hospital and her daughter is able to work. Her daughter met me last week and said it was a miracle. Her mother also says it is a miracle in her life. The person dealing with the elderly realised it was possible to do something tangible rather than putting her into care. Her quality of life has improved considerably as a result of that cataract operation.</P>
      <P>I was in the Mount Herbert Hotel recently where a group of 40 people were staying, all of whom had cataract operations in a Dublin hospital. I remember noticing at breakfast time that most people were wearing an eye piece. A Lions Club from a rural area took it upon itself to do something for the elderly in its community. This can be done in certain specialities where there are waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Cataract operations are important. I ask the Minister of State to show a sense of vision in the health care service. There are four ophthalmic surgeons in Limerick. I am sure this service has been expanded around the country. We must show creativity if we want to reduce the numbers on waiting lists, particularly for cataract operations. The waiting list has probably improved considerably for orthopaedic procedures.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must look closely at the risk equalisation system. It is not compatible with what we want to achieve in 2000. We should try to encourage other insurers into the market. The VHI had a monopoly for a long time. It has a huge commercial advantage over other private insurers coming into the country. It is necessary for the cake to be divided more evenly. It is a deterrent to BUPA to force it to give £20 million over three years because it has a better claim risk than the VHI. That is not the right signal to send. It is possible for us to attract other insurers. We should encourage competition. We encouraged competition recently and we have been better for it. There is no reason competition should not exist in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> The Minister of State must also consider the nursing home subvention and the dramatic proliferation of private nursing homes around the country. As the population gets older, these nursing homes will expand further. It is necessary to consider a uniform nursing home charge because there are wide variations in the community. If we do not consider that, the subvention rates which have applied since the early 1990s should be increased to a level compatible with the consumer price index. This was a major issue at a meeting I was at recently which was attended by approximately 300 people. Although private nursing home owners were present at that meeting, people were talking about the financial difficulties they experienced trying to ensure their mother, father or other relative remained in a private nursing home. This area has not been considered and it should be because the population is getting older.</P>
    <P>One thing the Minister of State could do, which would help me greatly as a public representative based in Newcastlewest, is to ensure that St. Ita's is looked after. I am glad the Minister of State has taken note of it.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services on an equitable basis and of affordable and fair health insurance are fundamental political issues in any society. This Bill represents a progressive, caring and socially equitable policy of the type we have come to expect from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I welcome and strongly support it.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that health care and insurance polarised the American electorate and that was the reason the recent American presidential election was so close in the state of Florida. This House has seen many political battles over health. Vested interests in the health sector in every country have sought to keep Government intervention in health service provision to a minimum. In the eyes of vested interests, health is a lucrative business. However, in the eyes of the public and of responsible politicians, health is a social necessity for the well being of society where people must come before profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland there are a number of reasons we do not have a comprehensive free health service for the entire population. Until recently, the main reason was the relative poverty of our country and our small tax and population base compared to the European average. There was also resistance from the medical profession to socialise medicine and through the limitation of the market for private fee earning practice. The Health <Col N="111" /> Act, 1970, limited the provision of general medical services, or what is commonly known as the medical card, to 40% of our population. That limit was necessary to get the agreement of the medical profession to enter the scheme.</P>
    <P>During the 1980s under the Labour Party Minister, Barry Desmond, the limit was approached as a result of high unemployment and higher than projected eligibility for the medical card. The Fine Gael-dominated Government was not prepared to face down the medical profession and instead agreed to remove students from the medical card to avoid breaching the 40% limit. Many Deputies may not be aware of that but that is the reason most of our population must rely on private health insurance. Unless the Government is prepared to negotiate for a higher proportion of the population to be eligible for general medical services and society is prepared to pay the taxation necessary to support such a move, the situation will not change.</P>
    <P>Society is not screaming for such a change at present. It would prefer the money we can afford to be spent on better public hospital facilities and reducing waiting lists. The philosophy is that free medical services should be for the most needy sections of our society and that those who can afford it should take out private medical insurance. In such a health service regime the regulation of private health insurance assumes the highest importance for the general population. The Government has a duty to its citizens to intervene strongly in this area. Health insurance is a social necessity for at least 60% of the population rather than a luxury upgrade for the better off.</P>
    <P>As regards public and private health services, it is a scandal that paying for private medical insurance moves a patient up the waiting list. Only medical diagnosis should determine the order in which patients are treated. Anything less is a perversion of the highest ideals of the medical profession as expressed in the Hippocratic oath which, after religious beliefs, is the ultimate expression of a medical doctor's moral code of honour in society.</P>
    <P>I want to outline a clear vision of the role of private health insurance in Irish society. What I will say amounts to a straightforward charter for the way Irish society should organise payment for its health services. Not alone do I expect to get the support of my party but I expect to hear the leaders and spokespersons of other parties back me or explain what they object to.</P>
    <P>We have made a political choice as a society to organise our health services on the basis of providing free, fully publicly funded health services for the least well off minority, not more than 40% of our population, and to provide partially publicly supported hospitals combined with fee charging health services for the rest of our population. It is accepted that a minority of Deputies in this House on the left stand for global public health services for reasons of ideology. However, <Col N="112" /> they have always been a minority. It is also accepted that a minority of Deputies in this House on the right stand for minimising public health services for reasons of ideology. They too cannot get electoral support for such a policy. The rest of us stand for providing affordable, secure, high quality, equitable, people-centred health services for reasons of common sense.</P>
    <P>The people who are ineligible for public, free medical services require general private health insurance as a necessity. For this majority of the population, general private health insurance is not an upgrade from the basic public health system. General private health insurance is the public health system, and for this greater sector of the population to the end of ensuring social justice the Government has every right to intervene in private health insurance. This is not a place for the ideology or language of profit, market deregulation and unfettered competition.</P>
    <P>Regardless of who is paying for the treatment, patients should be treated in order of medical need. To that end, the Government should give serious consideration to allowing for each medical practitioner and facility a single waiting list for each service or procedure graded only in terms of medical need. Many of the more advanced treatments are, of necessity, expensive in that they have been recently developed as a result of costly research. Nevertheless, it would be unChristian not to make those available to the entire community. A good example of this is the Relenza anti-'flu inhaler. We cannot as a society decide that some people should be prescribed this medicine while others, such as those on medical cards, will not be prescribed it on cost grounds.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the term &ldquo;community&rdquo;&ndash; our nation is based on family and community. We choose to organise our health care system by means of a public-private mix. That, however, does not imply that we choose a two tier health system. Such a system is abhorrent to the decency of any caring society. For that reason, we have strong laws to impose the principle of community rating in the field of medical insurance. I support those laws and will continue to support them &ndash; they matter to my constituents in Cork and to their families. Health insurance should not be seen as a business or an industry. It is a social service and an essential one for all the people who are outside the medical card system.</P>
    <P>The European Commission and elements of the European movement have been carried away with the notion that unbridled free enterprise and bans on State intervention are European and that anyone opposing them and standing for social protection is in some way anti-European. Nothing could be further from the truth. Unbridled competition is not appropriate in some areas and health insurance is one of them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we all want cheaper health insurance. Unlike some people, however, I also appreciate that we want access to affordable health insurance. A society in which the young, lower risk sector of the market gets cheaper <Col N="113" /> health insurance at the expense of the older, higher risk sector is what the poet WB Yeats might have called &ldquo;no country for old men&rdquo;. Community rating is necessary to ensure equitable access to health insurance for all. Control of health insurance premiums must be achieved across the board. In Britain, many older people cannot afford health insurance and in some cases, will not be admitted to health insurance schemes for reasons of age. We in Fianna Fáil are determined to avoid this happening in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government to get as many people as possible of all ages to take out private health insurance. This Bill aims to strengthen the provisions necessary to protect the rights of elderly people, in particular, to affordable health insurance. To that end we will extend the enrolment provisions of the 1994 Act to the over-65 age group. Late entry premiums will be permitted under certain circumstances but controlled. Some flexibility is necessary as it is not the aim of the Government to unjustly hobble the insurance companies. This is a landmark provision for senior citizens which I strongly support. Any Deputy considering voting against this provision should think long and hard on how he or she will justify it to the senior citizens at the next election.</P>
    <P>With the limited late entry premiums, we are also sending out a clear message to younger and middle aged people &ndash; get into private medical insurance early and stay there. People should regard their premiums as part of a social justice umbrella for the entire community. We need to start thinking as a society and a community rather than always focusing on the hit on our own pockets. I challenge any extended family of three generations to compare how they would fare with and without community rating.</P>
    <P>Community rating is very simple. The wage earners must contribute more in the years when they are earning to avoid large bills when they are older or retired. Community rating protects the consumer from insurers who would certainly cherry pick the lower risk customers for profit leaving the more socially democratic insurers, if I can put it that way, to pick up the higher risk group with no alternatives but to offer high cost insurance.</P>
    <P>With this Bill we are adding an additional social protection for the provision of health insurance. We cannot allow the risk profile of one company or group of companies to endanger the other players in the market. To that end we propose to introduce the concept of risk equalisation. Simply put, the market will be balanced financially. It is an interventionist measure but I have no problem supporting it as I fear the alternative from a social point of view.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies, I have received lobbying material from one insurer campaigning against this measure. I am faced with a choice between commercial and social interest. I have no hesitation in supporting the social interest in this case. We had plenty of time to discuss the issues in the <Col N="114" /> White Paper, now is the time for decisive action to implement the provisions. I genuinely hope that a large majority of Deputies, including many from the Opposition, will join me in supporting the Bill. I will be disappointed if those in other parties who campaigned for a socially just, inclusive, non-ageist Ireland could not support the positive realistic measure to advance that cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is great to hear a lion of free enterprise making the argument in the House for social solidarity. I applaud what Deputy O'Flynn said and I will re-emphasise in what I will say the idea he has promulgated that medical need not ability to pay must be one of the defining features of the health care system we hope to build now that we are a more prosperous country. We must build it properly so that there is no discrimination and we eliminate the perception that by going private, one somehow gets up the ladder or the list. That is utterly wrong and something that this party does not stand for and will not stand for in the long run.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn outlined the false comparison which is this debate over Europe, whether we are looking towards Berlin or towards Boston. We in Fianna Fáil and the people of Ireland should look clearly at choosing the middle way, the middle course between those two points.</P>
      <P>The 1999 Act was concerned with protecting and preserving the core principles and values of this country's unique system of health insurance. These core principles are community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit across a range of services and risk equalisation. The aim of the principal Act was to safeguard the core principles while facilitating entry to and competition in the marketplace. Only one insurer, BUPA has entered in competition with VHI to date. It entered the market in January 1997 and has now provided cover for over 160,000 people. Health insurance legislation must strike a successful balance between the common good and the values of community solidarity enshrined in our system and the development of a truly competitive market designed to deliver quality choice and service to consumers at an affordable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the new provision is to restrict the definition of hospital in-patient and day-patient services leaving ancillary services such as outpatient, general practitioner, optical and dental outside its scope. The stated purpose of this is that the insurance market for ancillary services has not developed owing to the primary focus on providing protection against the potentially severe costs of major illness or injury and that by removing it from the scope of the legislation there will exist an incentive for greater insurance activity and growth in this sector of health care. I would ask the Minister to consider what safeguards might be necessary, in moving in this direction, to ensure that the growth of insurance products for the ancillary care market does not in any way encroach upon or in any way undermine <Col N="115" /> the principle of community rating by completely deregulating this market and permitting it to be operated on a purely risk rated basis.</P>
    <P>Some concerns have been expressed by experts and operators in the health insurance market that the new entrants could, by maintaining the price of the health insurance product while discounting the price of primary health care products to younger better risk groups, undermine in the medium to long-term the concept of community rating. I would ask the Minister to consider what measures, either legislative or by way of ministerial regulation of the primary health care insurance market, might be necessary to avoid precisely such a scenario. I am fully supportive of the move to remove any ambiguity in relation to the provision of insurance in respect of long-term nursing care by excluding it from the definition of health insurance.</P>
    <P>I am a little troubled by another aspect of the change of definition. The Principal Act defined the contract as having as its &ldquo;sole and principal purpose&rdquo; the provision of hospital in-patient services. The new definition changes this to &ldquo;one of the purposes&rdquo;. Has the Minister considered that, under the 1994 Act, it could have been possible, for instance, to sell at a commercial rate a policy for the supply of a television, as the principal purpose was for the payment of non-medical services provided in a hospital? Now, under the Bill, such contracts would have to be community rated because it enshrines in law the principle that non-medical hospital services, where they are sold in conjunction with hospital services, no matter how small, must be community rated. Did the Minister consider that this might tie his hands unnecessarily and stifle innovation? Can the matter be reconsidered to ensure that this type of thing does not occur?</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce late entry loading for the over-35s can only serve to strengthen and underpin the community based values and solidarity of our existing system. It gives a real incentive for young people to take out health insurance early and to maintain their cover throughout their working life. It is an entirely fair and equitable approach to late entrants. The opening up of the open enrolment principle to the over 65s is a welcome move in the light of a population which is ageing and is entirely consistent with the new system of late entry loading. It makes practical sense.</P>
    <P>A major part of the Bill deals with risk equalisation, which is of vital importance to a health insurance system based on community rating and open enrolment. Risk equalisation is designed to eliminate the incentive to engage in what is often termed cherry picking or, in the jargon of the industry, preferred risk selection. It is designed to promote the stability of the competitive system which we now have. In introducing a risk equalisation scheme, the new Health Insurance Authority should also take account of the impact of any scheme on potential damage to competition <Col N="116" /> within the industry and the obvious implications for inflation in the health sector. The prescribed field of discretion to be accorded to the new authority in relation to any threat to market stability should have regard to, among other assessment criteria, such considerations as the possible down sizing of the market, the exit of older age policy holders and the impending collapse of one or more insurers. Any requirement for risk equalisation must be considered in such a broader industry context and not simply be an academic, mathematical or actuarial review of risk profiles. I am pleased that the Minister intends to set out the detailed arrangements for the operation of risk equalisation in a statutory scheme. I hope, in the interests of making such schemes fully workable and securing the willing co-operation and involvement of industry participants, that there will be full consultation with all concerned parties in the preparation of any statutory scheme so that they will have every opportunity to fully articulate their concerns. I am glad that in the current Minister, Deputy Martin, we have a Minister who will fulfil that mandate. It is no secret that members of the teaching profession rated Deputy Martin highly&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is heartening to note that Deputy Lenihan, having begun and finished in typical Lenihan form, had a long part in the middle of his speech that was very technical and complicated, and different from what we usually hear from him. His opening remarks are ones that I am sure he will be delighted to read when the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; come out. In those he said that Fianna Fáil would not stand for people moving up the ladder to obtain health services by virtue of their membership of VHI, BUPA or any other insurer. That is an interesting concept. I am a member of VHI and have been for quite a number of years. I have not had reason to use it too often, but members of my family have, and they have used it <Col N="117" /> to good advantage. When sickness comes to one's door and if one happens to have been a member of the VHI for some time, one is glad to avail of it. If that means moving up the queue, that is what happens. If Fianna Fáil is so set on not allowing that, what measures are being brought forward to change it? I see nothing in the Government's manifesto that would change that scenario. It was interesting to hear what Deputy Lenihan had to say. In the heat of the moment Deputies say things like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of contributing on this Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill. It gives me an opportunity to address a number of issues. I must declare an interest. As I said earlier, I am a member of VHI and have been for quite a number of years. I was also involved for quite a number of years on a committee of this House that reviewed VHI. I am coming from a position of advantage, or disadvantage, in relation to this Bill and would have fairly set views on it.</P>
      <P>For a long time VHI had a monopoly. It was set up in 1957. As a youngster I remember my late mother advocating to my late father that they should join. My father was a policeman and money was not too plentiful, but I think he did join at that time. VHI served this country well. A local man from my area, the late Mr. Paddy Shaw, a gentleman of renown, a lawyer, served on the first board of VHI. He was a man of integrity, a man of great intellect. He was involved at the coal face and he often told me about the long meetings the board had. In those days being a member of a State board was in an honorary capacity &ndash; one put one's shoulder to the wheel and did what one could without remuneration. We should compliment the people who had that vision and who put in the work for us for so long.</P>
      <P>The whole question of deregulation of the market and of opening it up to competitors was looked at by our committee some time ago. There was much concern about the whole question of deregulation and what would happen, whether outside competitors would come in and set up here and cherry pick the clients. The whole question of community rating was looked at in some depth. We can talk about community rating and offering an across the board package to anybody of any age or from any community. However, the big question is how does one go about it? If one advertises in magazines that are read by young people, or by a particular type of clientele or by particular groups, they rather than others will be attracted to the company. The question of how to attract customers and not having all young customers must be looked at very carefully. That is contained in this legislation. We must be careful not to go overboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome the entry of BUPA into the health insurance market because VHI held a <Col N="118" /> monopoly position for a long time. In fact, I believe it abused that position. The advent of BUPA created competition in the market. Approximately 1.6 million people are VHI members and BUPA has approximately 185,000 members. A further 1.2 million people hold medical cards, leaving approximately one million people without any form of health cover aside from basic hospital cover. By international comparisons, quite a high number of Irish people &ndash; in the region of 45% of the population &ndash; have private health insurance. The 45% figure is high compared to the 12% of people in Britain who have private health insurance. Of course, Britain has a different health care system to ours in which everyone is entitled to equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned by the definition of the &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo;. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle also has concerns about this. For example, what constitutes long-term care? If people with a mental illness or some other serious condition are in hospital for lengthy periods, will the insurance companies provide cover if the hospitalisation period lasts longer than 90 days? They will not do so in regard to mental illness, a regrettable change which has come about in recent years. Mental illness can be very serious and we should not discriminate against sufferers in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in regard to premiums for the over-35 age group. The Department should launch an advertising campaign which would encourage people to avail of health insurance prior to 35 years of age. The companies for which two of my children work actually pay their health insurance premia. Perhaps the Minister could offer incentives to such companies in order that they would encourage their workforce to obtain health insurance.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the VHI's monopoly position. One of my bugbears in regard to health insurance companies is that if one has a dispute with such companies, there is no facility to take the matter up with an independent adjudicator. Where can people seek redress if VHI decides they are not covered? I have interceded with VHI on behalf of some of my constituents and found the company's approach to be very dogmatic and dictatorial. I want to outline two cases in particular, one of which cost VHI members huge amounts of money. I refer to St. Francis's Medical Centre in Mullingar, with which members of the medical fraternity will be familiar. A dispute arose there in regard to cover and went on for some time. VHI indicated its intention to delist the centre. As someone who lives in Mullingar, I must declare an interest in this matter. I was greatly concerned for the centre's staff and patients and spent a great deal of time trying to devise ways in which VHI and St. Francis's Medical Centre could arrive at a solution. I spoke at length to representatives of VHI and the hospital and advanced various proposals, one of which was that an independent arbitrator should be <Col N="119" /> brought in to assess the dispute and attempt to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I brought a person from the hospital's board to Dublin to meet with a senior VHI representative. We travelled up to Dublin on a snowy January morning to keep the appointment only to discover that the meeting had been called off without any explanation. Reading between the lines, I was led to believe that the Minister of the day &ndash; a fine lady who only held the office for a very short time and in whose constituency the hospital was &ndash; had given strong indications that the meeting should not proceed. We were left high and dry. The hospital was subsequently delisted and the case went to court. Several court hearings, including a Supreme Court hearing, were held and the hospital was awarded a settlement which amounted to millions of pounds. I do not begrudge the hospital the award but it turns my stomach that members of the legal profession received hundreds of thousands of pounds when the matter could have been simply resolved if the VHI had been prepared to enter into discussions. Instead, the company used subscribers' money to fight the case through the courts only to lose it eventually. I am disappointed that the Bill does not provide any means of dispute arbitration.</P>
    <P>The second case I wish to raise concerns a decent, honourable and unassuming elderly man who lives in Mullingar. The man's wife was hospitalised in St. Francis's during the period when the hospital was delisted. The man was a member of VHI all his life and his wife spent the last 14 days of her life in the hospital. Her husband assumed she would be covered. VHI refused to pay the meagre amount of cover to which the man was entitled for his wife's hospitalisation. The total bill of £700 was very small in VHI terms but was quite substantial for a pensioner on low income. I raised the case with VHI which only dug in its heels. I subsequently took the case to the Insurance Ombudsman. Incidentally, the State Ombudsman does not deal with VHI matters.</P>
    <P>I dealt with a very fine lady in the office of the Insurance Ombudsman who issued very favourable correspondence to me. However, because she was too good at her job and was being too fair, the insurance companies made it impossible for her to retain her position and the job was given to someone else. Unfortunately, the poor man in Mullingar was left out in the cold. It is very important that if disputes arise with the health insurance companies, people have some facility to take the matter up with an independent arbitrator. The majority of health insurance company members are ordinary decent people who do not want to have to take their cases to court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton. The motion tabled by Deputy Upton and the Labour Party is timely and highly commendable. It is of paramount importance that Ireland continues to present and sell on the world market a top class, disease free beef product. Our cattle and beef exports are a vital cog in our economy, hence the importance of a superb product.</P>
      <P>There can be no shortcomings allowed in any section of our beef industry which would impede our efforts to maintain the highest possible standards. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Ministers of State and the departmental officials must always be alert to the pitfalls which could be encountered by the industry if the highest degree of vigilance is not maintained. I wish to impress upon the Minister the necessity for him to maintain vigilance as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Unlike other EU nations Ireland's beef industry is highly dependent on an export market. Therefore, only a top class, disease free product will suffice. It is most important that we maintain the highest possible standards of beef production, given that we have a population of 3.5 million and export over 75% of our beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer confidence is of vital importance to the beef and cattle industry. We must strive to ensure that not only will Irish beef become the choice of housewives in Ireland, but that it becomes the choice of housewives throughout the world. We have the distinction of producing the most natural, top quality beef products in the world. We should capitalise on that and insist that every possible effort is taken to ensure BSE is eradicated as soon as possible from our cattle population. Irish farmers must strive to have their beef cattle finished for the market within 24 to 30 months of age. Baby beef production must be encouraged by the Minister and I appeal to him to introduce a special incentive scheme towards that end for those who produce baby beef, paid <Col N="122" /> to Irish fatteners. The Minister should encourage the necessity of having all our beef cattle exported by the age of 30 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister must insist that adequate facilities are put in place immediately to dispose of BSE infected animals. An incineration plant is probably the answer, but the Minister must make up his mind and not dilly dally. He cannot afford to play for time on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Meat and bone meal is another problem. Ireland exports over 90% of meat and bone meal and it should not be beyond the capacity of the Minister to ensure the remaining portion of meal is also exported. He should be thinking positively and completely ban the use of meat and bone meal. Such provision was introduced through legislation by a former Minister for Agriculture, but it was never implemented.</P>
    <P>Prevention is better than cure and drastic steps must be taken by the Minister to allay any fears among consumers. The Minister must be seen to take positive action on this crucial matter and must not be blinkered in any way in taking stern measures to combat any shortcomings.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Upton and the Labour Party on bringing this timely motion to the House. I saw the worst news possible for farmers on the 6 o'clock news this evening, which brings me back to that terrible day in 1996 when the BSE crisis hit in Britain and we went down with the tide. The problem that time, as bad as it was, is not as bad as what has now happened because we are a beef exporting nation and the nations to which we export are now at the heart of the BSE crisis. It is one thing to try to export meat to a nation which can eat it, but it is extremely difficult to sell our beef when there is a 50% drop in our main markets. For the past three or four years we have been trying to get a grip on the continental market. The only button on our trousers was the Egyptian trade.</P>
      <P>It is not an Irish question, but an issue for the entire EU. This will test the mettle of the EU which will have to implement the necessary testing and certification procedures which will allow countries such as Egypt to buy our meat. I have already spoken to a few farmers since 6 o'clock, and I know that many farmers are wondering if they will be able to sell cattle at all over the next few months. The Minister knows I am not overstating things as he was on this side of the House in 1996. The Minister and the Government must do everything possible to get Europe as a unit to work from tomorrow morning to convince consumers within and without the EU that we have a good product. The problem is that the perception is the product is not good. In fairness to successive Governments, we went to the trouble of slaughtering entire herds which had one BSE infected animal, something which is done by no other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then ensured that carcasses of BSE infected animals were not buried on Irish farms, and I assume that is being addressed. I assume <Col N="123" /> the issue of meat and bone meal will also be addressed. I am sorry I do not have more time as this is a most serious debate. Today's events in Egypt are most important. So far as the actual BSE test on carcasses is concerned, we have no alternative but to go down the road announced for cattle over 30 months. We are lucky to have the test. It is one thing to declare a country free of BSE, I do not know whether that can be done, but it is another thing to declare a farm free of BSE and it is hugely important to declare the carcase free of BSE so that people can say there is no BSE in the T-bone steak from that carcass &ndash; that is on the point of contact with the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister can look forward to a winter of discontent because many farmers are on the brink of financial ruin due to loss of markets. This is all about certification, verification and everything we can do to ensure consumers worldwide believe that the cattle from Ireland and elsewhere are safe. We have had four years of painful experience of BSE controls. France and Germany stuck out their chests and told consumers they were BSE free and renationalised their markets at our expense. They have a different problem tonight. Their problem is our problem because we will expect their people to eat our meat.</P>
    <P>From tomorrow morning onwards there is a huge responsibility on the Minister because there are at least 80,000 Irish farmers who will see this as the worst winter for many years.</P>

      <P>Last night my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, outlined the approach of his Department to controlling and eradicating BSE, to ensuring that the health of consumers is protected and assuring the quality and safety of our beef.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated, this evening I will deal with the public health and food safety aspects of this issue. As the Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, my primary concern is public health and the safety of food consumed by the public. Therefore, with regard to BSE, I am concerned with the public health implications of this disease and any risk it poses to humans. The protection of the public's health has to be of paramount importance and it is only when the public has been reassured that its interests are being protected that consumer confidence will be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996 we have been aware of a link between BSE in cows and Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, commonly known as CJD, in humans. CJD is a rare transmissible encephalopathy in humans and is the collective name for a group of diseases <Col N="124" /> which cause progressive dementia and a loss of control of movement and balance. There are four main categories of this condition, including sporadic &ndash; classic &ndash;  and new variant CJD or vCJD as it is known. Until recently, the overall global incidence of CJD was approximately one case per million per year. However, this has increased in recent years, with the increase most likely due to greater awareness and active surveillance, as well as improvements in diagnosis.</P>
    <P>New variant CJD was first described in Britain in 1996. Clinically, these cases present at an earlier age and are different from classic CJD. The presenting features include behavioural disturbances followed by difficulties with balance and walking. The average survival is approximately 18 months, which is longer than in the case of classic sporadic CJD. Confirmation of new variant CJD is by post-mortem neuropathological examination. There has been one confirmed case of new variant CJD in Ireland. This individual had resided in Britain at the height of the BSE epidemic there.</P>
    <P>Experimental evidence indicates that new variant CJD and BSE are caused by the same agent. Brain tissue from new variant CJD patients show similar features to animals experimentally infected with the BSE agent. In relation to the source of new variant CJD infection, the most likely explanation is the ingestion by humans of BSE contaminated food prior to the implementation of the ban on specified bovine offals infected with the BSE agent.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, this Government has attached particular importance to the issue of food safety in general and the concerns of consumers in particular. As Minister of State with special responsibility for food safety, I was particularly pleased to oversee the passage of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act through the Oireachtas. This legislation provides the framework for the current and future management and development of food safety here. The authority is a statutory, independent and science based agency reporting directly to the Minister for Health. It was formally established on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>In July 1999 responsibility for ensuring the enforcement of all food safety legislation was transferred to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The powers attributed to the authority include those available under all existing food safety legislation as well as additional new enforcement powers.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland operates by means of service contracts with the agencies currently engaged in the enforcement of food safety legislation. The agencies must provide the resources for the implementation of the service contracts. These agencies act as agents of the authority in the performance of their contracts and the authority has published details of these contracts, including resource provision. It may publish reports on any matter related to its remit and functions and in particular it must publish an <Col N="125" /> annual report which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. These arrangements are designed to ensure a much greater degree of transparency and information about food safety generally and the operation of the control system. It is generally acknowledged that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has already had a profound effect on raising the consciousness of producers, retails and consumers alike, of the need to and benefits from making available high quality, safe food products.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides for the establishment of a scientific committee to assist and advise the board of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in relation to matters of a scientific nature and such advice may be published by the board. Much of the work of the scientific committee is conducted by means of sub-committees and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established a scientific sub-committee specially looking at BSE. This sub-committee is chaired by Professor Michael Gibney who is chair of one of the EU advisory committees on BSE. The focus of this committee is to keep the authority informed of all the new scientific information and also to undertake risk assessments and advise on risk management strategies on BSE and food safety. For example, my Department recently sought the observations of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on the Philips report on the BSE inquiry, recently published by the UK Government, and this report is being examined by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's BSE sub-committee.</P>
    <P>Under the service contract arrangement the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is developing a seamless inspection service from farm gate to the point of sale to consumers as in the past the inspectorate was fragmented across several agencies. This will ensure that there are no gaps in the continuum of consumer protection from farm gate to the point of sale to consumers. I am aware of the considerable work carried out by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in relation to the meat sector, which has been treated as a priority in the first year of operation.</P>
    <P>All food safety inspections are now co-ordinated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland under a contractual arrangement to develop a service where all the multi-disciplinary professionals are working together with a focus on maximum protection for consumers. We need to continue to further develop an efficient and effective inspectorate. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland advises that the controls on plants producing meats for the home markets needed improvement to be equivalent to those in export plants. Action is being taken to improve compliance across the board.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has just completed the first phase of screening programme for all cattle over 30 months using the ENFER test. It has completed a pilot testing programme of 1,000 older animals entering the food chain with no <Col N="126" /> positive results. As Deputy Upton noted last night, it is never possible to prove a negative. The EU Commissioner with responsibility for health and consumer protection has stated that no member state can give a guarantee that its beef or any other food can be zero risk rated in relation to infection. Zero risk does not exist and the consumer must be so informed. However, this screening programme, which will be in place in early January, will be a significant further risk reduction measure.</P>
    <P>The presence of BSE in our national herd is a problem we must face and with which we must deal. The fact that the cases are confined to older animals is encouraging but it is still a worry. The younger animals which have not eaten meat and bone meal are as safe as any beef has been in the past. Having effective traceability systems that can identify these animals at the point of sale to the consumer is welcome. The current ENFER test for screening older animals is an additional consumer protection measure. We need to be confident that meat and bone meal and tallow are dealt with appropriately.</P>
    <P>While the developments in food safety at national, EU and international levels are welcome, legislation and policy changes alone will not guarantee the safety of our food. This is as relevant to the issue of BSE-CJD as to other food safety issues. A guarantee of safe food for all is a shared responsibility and in protecting the food chain from farm to fork, Government, industry and the consumer must each play their part.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority is working with industry to ensure food safety is an integral part of all food business in Ireland. Responsibility for producing safe food rests with the industry and it must take initiatives to ensure every precaution is taken to protect consumers and that their staff are well trained and fully aware of the risks. The Food Safety Authority is encouraging training for all key personnel and a number of training initiatives are under way in the red meat sector.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is currently involved with FÁS in implementing an extensive training package for abattoir workers in the various sectors. The first sector is the red meat slaughter. A series of modules have been produced. A &ldquo;Train the Trainers&rdquo; course was run at UCC, followed by a pilot training programme in four selected export abattoirs. This pilot phase has recently been completed and certificates have been awarded to those participating. Lessons learned from the pilot are now being incorporated into the pilot course and the course will be offered to all export abattoirs in the new year. As part of this initiative, the authority has engaged UCC to develop a similar programme covering the various food safety elements for the local authority abattoirs.</P>
    <P>As well as the activities of the Food Safety Authority targeted specifically at food safety, my Department has also undertaken other initiatives in response to the emergence of CJD. In September 1996, in order to be in a position to <Col N="127" /> respond rapidly and in an appropriate manner to the issue of CJD, the Minister for Health and Children established a CJD advisory group, under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall of the virus reference laboratory in UCD. The other members of the group are drawn from experts in the fields of veterinary neuropathology, haematology, infectious diseases, science, public health and food safety. This group's function is to advise the Minister for Health and Children on all issues relating to CJD and to provide advice to the Minister on particular or specific issues referred to it from time to time.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the CJD advisory group are as follows: surveillance of CJD in Ireland, including active surveillance, diagnostic criteria and mechanisms for data collection and timelessness of data; assessment of the scientific developments, both national and international, with regard to risks to public health concerning BSE-CJD, including risks from occupational exposure, food safety, use of pharmaceuticals and transmissibility; the provision of advice on research strategies for BSE-CJD, including an assessment of the retrospective study of CJD, genetic mapping and the link to CJD and maximising the opportunities for international collaboration, including EU, Biomed and the World Health Organisation; the provision of advice to the Minister for Health and Children and the presentation of information to the media and to the general public on BSE-CJD. The group meets approximately six times per annum and has to date provided advice on risk management strategies in relation to transplants, blood transfusions, vaccines and medical instrumentation. The Department of Health and Children and other medical experts are also represented on the BSE advisory group set up by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Surveillance of CJD is a priority in order to establish the true incidence of the disease and to determine any changes in the pattern or nature of its occurrence.  From the Food Safety Authority point of view, everything that can be done is being done at present. We will continue to monitor the Irish, European and world scene to make sure we are doing everything possible in relation to this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this question and I wish to say something about a statement which was made here last night. An allegation was made that the Department, Minister and his officials are not concerned for consumers. It has been emphasised in the past number of years that consumers are considered a priority and I want to defend the Department in that regard. I am sure we are all agreed that in dealing with the serious issue of BSE, our primary concern should be for the health and safety of the citizens of Ireland, other EU countries and Third World countries to which we export our produce. There are also very serious economic issues arising for this country. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has already dealt with a number of these issues in his contribution. Developments today create further difficulties and these will have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we retain a sense of perspective in dealing with this issue. Clearly the best way to ensure that the health and safety of our citizens is protected is to base the measures we adopt on the best scientific information available and to enforce such controls. Measures based on instantaneous reactions to the latest media information will not serve to protect consumer health. Successive Governments of all persuasions have taken a responsible approach in dealing with BSE and we must continue to work together to ensure that the measures taken to deal with the problem are based on the best scientific evidence available.</P>
      <P>This is, of course, the basis on which Irish and horizontal Community measures have up to now been developed. The knowledge that this is so gives Irish and indeed other European consumers every reason to have confidence in the methods adopted to assess the risks arising from BSE and in the measures adopted to address these risks. It is on this basis that we will approach the additional measures that have been proposed by the European Commission today arising from the deliberations of the EU's scientific steering committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, it is extremely important to continue to assure consumers that we are confident that the proper application of the horizontal measures already adopted within the Community, including those in relation to the use of meat and bone meal, and the banning of SRMS, provides a sound basis for protecting public health. In addition, the geographical risk assessment adopted by the scientific steering committee of the European Commission earlier this year provides a reasonable basis, founded on scientific principles, for assessing the risk in member states <Col N="129" /> and for developing appropriate policies to combat this risk.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the geographical risk assessment in relation to Ireland are particularly reassuring. Ireland is a low incidence country and its system for the control of BSE is optimally stable. In other words, the measure adopted in relation to control of meat and bonemeal and to eliminate specified risk materials from the human food and animal feed chains are being effectively applied in Ireland. Very few countries have attained this level of stability and I am satisfied the endorsement of our system by this type of independent scientific body provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in our beef. This rating for Ireland was not achieved without a degree of pain and cost. I compliment everyone who co-operated in that process. European countries now regard our system as the one they should have introduced.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for rural development in a nation for which the agricultural industry is a central part of its economic and cultural identify, I am acutely aware of the need to ensure that consumers have confidence in our produce. It is for this reason we supported the Commission proposal for additional testing for BSE. I applaud my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, for the swift and decisive action he is taking to supplement the existing comprehensive range of controls in Ireland by expanding the active surveillance programme for BSE in advance of any Commission requirement to do so.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we had already, since May 2000, embarked upon a programme of active surveillance for BSE, in anticipation of the horizontal application of such measures across Europe from 1 January 2001. This programme is supplementary to, and complements our existing range of controls which includes the culling and destruction of all herd and birth cohorts of animals infected with BSE, the removal and destruction of SRMS from all bovine and ovine animals and a comprehensive and effective range of measures which ensures that ruminants can not be exposed to rations containing meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>I am confident these measures have been applied effectively and that consumers in Ireland have every reason to share that confidence. The Minister's proposal to expand the testing regime can only serve to provide further reassurance to consumers in Ireland and across Europe that the beef they and their families eat is subject to the most rigorous controls and every effort is being made to ensure the food on their tables is of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>I assure the House &ndash; and this point has already been confirmed by our French colleagues whose active surveillance programme began in June of this year &ndash; that the delivery of a programme of testing of the kind now proposed by the Minister is an enormous logistical task. Its successful implementation will require the co<Col N="130" /> operation of all those involved in the beef industry and I am pleased the reaction to date from farm bodies has been extremely positive and responsible.</P>
    <P>This testing will be additional to the extensive control and eradication measures we already have in place. In particular, we will continue with the depopulation of herds and the removal of cohort cattle where a case of BSE is confirmed. It has been suggested that this approach is not scientifically justified. However, it remains the position that we still do not fully understand BSE transmission routes, the depopulation policy is widely accepted internationally and it has served us well on a number of fronts. It is of interest to note that in the UK more than 90% of BSE cases this year were in herds which already had a previous BSE case.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have alluded to the issue of disposal. I was glad to hear Deputy Sheehan advocating incineration. I hope he can find a suitable site in his constituency for an incinerator and oblige us with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present for that part of the debate. I heard Deputy Sheehan make the suggestion this evening but I am accused by Deputy Stanton of being political. I would not wish to touch on Deputy Stanton's jealousy of Deputy Sheehan's proposal.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies also alluded to the question of burial of BSE suspect animals which has been well aired in the media in recent weeks, particularly in light of the incident in Galway where an animal was disinterred. Swift action was taken to avoid a repetition of this type of incident and the carcases are currently being kept in cold storage until a more permanent solution has been found. We are well aware &ndash; and the Minister has publicly acknowledged on a number of occasions &ndash; that this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. What has emerged in the course of the debate on this motion is an all-party consensus that an incinerator is required as a matter of urgency, to deal with this problem and the problem of disposal of animal waste generally. I fervently hope the level of consensus apparent in the House over the past two nights is reflected on the ground when these matters fall for decision at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of lessons must be learned from recent events in Europe and taken forward to develop a coherent set of policies to deal with the BSE problem. Reaction to developments in relation to BSE needs to be based on a rational <Col N="131" /> analysis of the situation based on the best scientific principles; measures to tackle the problem should, if possible, be agreed on a horizontal basis at European level and unilateral action by individual member states which is likely to give rise to disproportionate consumer and market reaction, should be avoided if at all possible; and measures adopted at European level must be properly implemented by member states.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the evidence available in relation to Ireland is that the enhanced controls introduced in October 1996 in relation to the licensing and control of meat and bonemeal, and in February 1997 in relation to the exclusion of specified risk materials from human food and animal feed, have been properly and effectively implemented. Such effective controls have not been introduced or enforced everywhere to the same degree and this is primarily responsible for the reactions to recent developments in other member states . The Commission's proposals from today's meeting relate both to additional consumer assurances and market aspects. We will participate in the negotiations on these proposals in a constructive way with a view to providing the necessary safeguards to consumers. It is certain that additional market measures will also be required in the short-term and I am pleased that this aspect is included in the Commission's proposals. We will seek to ensure that the measures adopted take full account of our unique situation.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion, as amended, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is a timely one and there is clear consensus in the House in relation to the seriousness of the issue and the primacy of consumer health related issues. While acknowledging the serious effects on the beef industry and the national economy, of the current crisis of confidence among beef consumers in Europe and elsewhere, Deputy Walsh has detailed the many measures taken by successive Governments to control and eradicate BSE and the systems put in place have withstood the most rigorous scrutiny from a variety of international bodies whose focus ranges from science to market issues. In particular, a range of very stringent controls in relation to the manufacture, possession, sale and use of meat and bonemeal have been introduced. These were all designed to facilitate enforcement of the ban on feeding this product to ruminants and to prevent cross-contamination.</P>
      <P>The doubts recently expressed regarding the efficacy of animal feed controls in other member states do not apply in Ireland where the enhanced regime introduced in 1997 has been endorsed by a range of international bodies. The policy of culling herd mates and birth cohorts of BSE infected animals was a far-sighted initiative and these measures, together with the feed measures, have served to protect both consumers and markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all of this, recent events in France, the unilateral measures taken by Spain, Austria and <Col N="132" /> a number of third countries, together with the discovery for the first time of BSE cases in Spain and Germany have given rise to a serious crisis in consumer confidence in Europe which is having a severe impact on markets for Irish beef and livestock.</P>

      <P>After the announcements from Egypt, we realised the extra pressure on our industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development last night gave details of BSE and when it was first confirmed in 1989 when we had 15 cases. That will increase to approximately 140 cases this year. We have not detected any animal under two years old with the disease. Generally speaking, we are talking about cows which are four or five years old or even older. While the problem is serious, we should not exaggerate it. When we compare the figures in England to ours, we will realise that a small fraction of animals in this country have BSE.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the measures introduced to deal with the problem. If there was a similar strategy across Europe, the problem would not be as severe as it is. EU member states are being asked to increase their efforts in a campaign against the mad cow disease by adopting a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to any animals, including poultry and pigs. The EU Commission is also proposing a ban on all cattle over 30 months from the food chain unless previously tested for BSE and cleared. That is very important. From an Irish point of view, we will have no problem complying with these measures.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about the purchase for destruction scheme but if that is what is required to reassure the customer, they are the types of measures we will have to take. At the end of the day, the consumer is the most important person in this equation and it is important that consumer fears are allayed. Farmers are not the cause of the problem but, unfortunately, they have had to pay a big price for it. At European Union level they are talking about limited intervention, but I think open intervention will have to be introduced to deal with the drop in price farmers are experiencing.</P>

She made an excellent and considered contribution last night. It was an outstanding and illuminating critique of the problems associated with BSE and how we might handle them in the future. She demonstrated the opportunities which would arise for us to take positive action which would complement they very positive action we have already taken in this regard, and I acknowledge that. However, further action needs to be taken.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister, as a wise and seasoned politician and as somebody who knows this trade inside out, to withdraw the amendment in the interests of uniting the House tonight. Commissioner Byrne, a legal colleague of mine, who is now the EU Commissioner in this area and is no doubt a very eminent man, brought forward a number of other measures today. It is incredible that the Minister will vote against this motion tonight and that next Monday and Tuesday he will go to Europe &ndash; we sent him our good wishes today at the committee &ndash; and accept the central thrust of Commissioner Byrne's proposal, the abolition or banning of meat or bonemeal for ruminants and non-ruminants across all species. The Minister will have to accept that &ndash; it is a temporary ban. We have shown the lead for four years and Europe is now following. Let us lead on and show by our actions here tonight that we know what it takes.</P>
      <P>We got a bit of a body blow this evening &ndash; I refer to the 150,000 tonnes. Egypt is a very important market for us. What has happened in the western European countries has obviously impacted on the market. The Minister will send people to Egypt and I have no doubt he will be successful because we will be able to show them what we have done. Acceptance of this amendment would be an added bow to the Minister's armoury. If there are elements which have financial implications, let us go back to the Minister for Finance. The Minister should accept the central thrust of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know about disposal. I fully agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and there cannot be any doubt that there will have to be a national incinerator for veterinary products and products of that nature. This will have to be dealt with. There is also the issue of fallen animals. We will deal with 130 to 140 carcases in BSE terms by the end of the year. That is an important aspect. When we ban meat and bonemeal, and not if, we will have 140,000 tonnes. We export <Col N="134" /> 95% to 99% of that. What will happen? This will be banned in other European countries. They will tell us we cannot leave this problem on their door step and they will ban it. They will tell us to deal with the 140,000 tonnes at home. We are all seasoned politicians and reasonable people. This is a national issue and it is more critical to us than any other country in Europe or the world in terms of its contribution to our gross agricultural output and our GDP. That is the kind of thing with which we will be faced.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, quite rightly said the consumer is king and we have to instil consumer confidence not just here, but across the globe. Globalisation means people know within seconds what we are doing through the Internet and so on. If we do this, we will send a clear signal about where we are going and what we are about. We will add to an existing layer which Deputy Upton acknowledged last night. If one animal is affected, the Minister is right to take out the whole cohort of animals affected. Anybody saying anything to the contrary does not understand the depth of the problem. That was a proper measure, although it was costly. Other countries would have been better off if they had done what we did.</P>
    <P>The way we deal with SRM is a very positive thing. I am not here to criticise. As the Minister knows, I have been constructive on many occasions in this matter. I call on him to go the full hog as they say in our part of the country where this is very important. As the Minister knows, the midlands and Westmeath is at the heart of beef production. This problem is hitting home and it will pulverise a county in which there is 82% cattle production. It is the hub of beef and winter fatteners. Some people used to say I defended the dog and stick crowd. They are the people who are important in this. The Minister heard from his constituency colleague about Bandon Mart this morning. The people who grow winter fatteners, who are as good as the people in the live trade, were down there competing. They paid too much, I agree, but, nevertheless, they are the people about whom we have to worry at this stage. The 10p reduction means that they lost £80 to £90 per head as a result of this scare which was not of their making or of this country's making.</P>
    <P>Nationalisation was another obstacle we had to face. This homogeneous concept of a level playing pitch was for the birds &ndash; it is aspirational Utopia-type stuff. We had nationalisation and re-nationalisation and our farmers lost out. Other countries poured money in and filled pot holes that appeared in the agri-industry and we were still the good Europeans. We have been good Europeans but sometimes we have to take the initiative. We have to do something for those farmers who are losing £80 to £90 per head. It is a critical factor in the compensation issue. A fellow with 50 or 60 winter fatteners will lose £5,000 or £6,000. That is a great deal of money to a family. It might not sound much but it is when one <Col N="135" /> has virtually nothing. It is so important that we cannot ignore it. Next week at the EU Council of Ministers the Commissioner with responsibility for food safety, David Byrne, will propose a temporary ban on all meat based animal feed in the European Union to help combat the spread of mad cow disease. He will also propose that all cattle aged over 30 months be excluded from the food chain unless they are tested for BSE.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, no animal under three years has been affected. Those affected are pre-1996, when we took action. However, there can be accidental cross-contamination. There are 18 licensed people in the pig industry using meat and bone meal as an ingredient; that is less than 1%. We have nothing to lose. It will not add greatly to the cost of the compound or rations. We must go there and show the way.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity to have integrated beef production and for Irish farmers to go down the road of having two and two a half year old beef production. The day of the three and a half year old bullock is gone. I still have some but they will have to go. If not, we will lose a glorious opportunity to sell beef.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus has much more to say than I have, but cattle testing must be introduced. The ENFER test which has been operating since 1997 is worthwhile. I was a meeting of farmers last night in Longford, a neighbouring constituency &ndash; we will have candidates standing there the next time. The farmers were delighted to hear of the test and want it to be introduced. I compliment my colleague who raised this matter on the Adjournment and also raised another issue last week. I compliment the farming organisations on being positive and supporting this. The Minister took it on board. Constructive opposition is no harm. I urge the Minister, as a sensible man and one with whom I have had many dealings, none of which was antagonistic but constructive, to withdraw this amendment and have a composite motion that will reflect the wishes of the House and be good for the country in the long-term.</P>

      <P>I would never claim to have more to say than Deputy Penrose nor to be able to say it so eloquently. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I, too, congratulate Deputy Upton on her concise, well informed and well thought out speech last night.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to understand why the Minister, on behalf of the Government, is refusing to accept this motion. The Government amendment is disturbingly minimalist. Its effect is to emasculate the important and timely protection presented in the body of the motion which is designed to allay fears, protect the public and our beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the EU Commissioner, David Byrne, who was appointed by this Government to his post, stated he intends to institute a EU wide ban from Monday and will be seeking the support of the Council of Ministers on the feed issue. This is <Col N="136" /> included in our motion. The point has been made that the Government should adopt this now and give an indication of good faith. The EU Commissioner will have a hard task implementing this ban. He is dealing with a variety of countries with different cultural attitudes, medical and agricultural practices. By comparison, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has a relatively easy task in terms of accepting this motion and putting down indicators that he means business, is taking a long view and is giving a lead. It is an opportunity for him and it a great pity he is unable to grasp it. I ask, even at this late stage, that he take the opportunity to have unity in the House on this matter.</P>

      <P>In his speech he pointed out the growth in BSE and the fact that, as recently as 1998, a total of 15 cases was confirmed and so far this year the total detected stands at 120 more. He made a curious point on which I challenge him. He stated that he could not understand how any experienced Member of this House could come here and talk about food safety matters being matters for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. He refuses to accept that there is an inextricable link between food production and food safety that transcends Departments. That is a difficulty and criticism he must take on board. Territorial demarcation or turf wars between Departments is the last thing we need in tackling such an important issue of public health. It is a health issue but that has a bearing on agriculture, food production and rural development. They must be tackled in a comprehensive and cohesive way rather than setting up lines of demarcation as if somehow that will help in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and beef production is a major feature of our economy. Thousands of people and communities depend on it for their livelihoods. If only for that reason alone the Government should not be doing the minimum but leading the way in the European Union. We should be the pathfinders in implementing progressive and precautionary safeguards. Instead we see obstacles, foot-dragging and a watering down of a motion that has been extremely well put together and deals with all facets of the issue. We presented this package and ask the Minister to take it on board.</P>
      <P>The Government's failure to face up to what is required has economic implications but, more importantly, implications for health and human life. There is every likelihood, if the Government persists along the road it is taking, that in years to come it will be the subject of investigation by some tribunal. How this Government deals with the BSE issue and the terrible threat of new variant CJD should be judged as if it were the subject of a tribunal. The reality is that is how it will be judged some time in the future. That must be taken on board in deciding on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> We are debating this issue against the background of the Lindsay tribunal which is investigating the lives and deaths of a cohort of Irish people who deserved the very best medical care and who instead received contaminated blood products that destroyed their health, in many instances, and their lives in some. The stories of the haemophiliacs who suffered such terrible injury are, at times, almost impossible to take in because of the extent of their tragedy and heartbreak. These are the victims of a profound failure by the State to protect and safeguard the health and lives of such vulnerable people. Even when the tribunal was being set up, obstacles and obfuscation were the characteristics of the Department of Health and Children in dealing with outstanding issues and legal representation. People who were doomed to die were forced to wait because the Department could not deal with their outstanding concerns. It is as if the Government learned nothing from this experience. We must adopt a different approach to very serious issues that are arising. We know something about BSE and new variant CJD. We do not know a huge amount but we know enough to adopt a new approach. We know the effects on animals and on humans. The horrific physical and mental deterioration it causes is recorded. We know that until 1996 enormous quantities of British beef were imported into this country. Dr. Patrick Wall put it very plainly: </P>
    <P>Never mind infectious material arising from Irish cattle. The Irish population has consumed an amount of BSE material from British cattle and it is likely that we may see new variant CJD cases in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Referring to that imported meat he said: &ldquo;We eat it. It was infected so somebody out there is incubating new variant CJD, I am sure&rdquo;. We know of one case since he made that speech and it is only a matter of time before there are others. Why are we not preparing for that as our motion presents?</P>
    <P>There was also the case involving the Amerscan Pulmonate II agent. Over 270 patients were given that product before it was recalled by the Irish Medicines Board. This is the type of system failure that puts people at risk. We must acknowledge that all systems fail. Nobody is infallible, regardless of whether they are Ministers, civil servants or others. However, we must ensure that we do the best possible job in terms of safeguarding public health. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children said that everything was being done, but that is not the case. The evidence of this is in the Government's response to the motion. Everything will not be done unless it changes its view on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government could take a lead in Europe. It would be a valuable role to adopt, particularly when markets are being closed to EU beef. Such a ban has a disproportionate impact on Irish trade. Other countries have shown how a refusal to face facts and to accept responsibility on this <Col N="138" /> issue is leaving a legacy of pain, suffering and death to individuals as well as causing collateral damage to a viable beef industry. We can do things differently and we should show the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for her clear presentation of the BSE issue and the Labour Party for tabling the motion which the Green Party wholeheartedly supports. I welcome the decision by the Minister to make the ENFER prion test compulsory in all animals over the age of 30 months by 1 January 2001. However, the Department still has considerable work to do on the issue.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, I asked the Minister how he intended to deal with the fallen animals problem due to the crisis in rendering. In his four line reply, which amounted to a &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; statement, the Minister said that the current indications showed an upturn in demand for feed products being produced by the rendering industry which would, in turn, ease the situation generally. However, we all accept now that this must stop. The voluntary ban is not good enough with regard to pig, poultry and fish meal. We all need to take stock and Mr. Tom Parlon of the IFA accepted this on the news this evening.</P>
      <P>In common with all parties in the House, the Green Party accepts that veterinary and hospital body parts incineration is essential to kill disease. The quickest way to increase veterinary incineration capacity in Ireland is to make it clear &ndash; this is the Minister's responsibility &ndash; that it is not municipal, industrial or hazardous waste incineration, but veterinary incineration. The other wastes can be avoided and treated without creating problematic emissions and toxic ash by-products. BSE needs incineration and it must be clearly stated that this is the purpose of the incineration.</P>
      <P>The livelihoods of many farming families depend on leadership from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on this issue. He must resist pressure from the &ldquo;burn everything in the bin&rdquo; brigade who will delay the solution to the BSE crisis by stirring up a controversy which is not to anybody's advantage. When the Minister is using the word &ldquo;incineration&rdquo;, he must ensure that he says &ldquo;veterinary incineration&rdquo;. Otherwise it will delay the solution to this very serious problem and nobody wants any delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the motion has not been accepted, but I am not surprised because the Government has not accepted a motion from this side for three and a half years. Unfortunately for family farmers who produce beef, this issue has not gone away. We thought it had been well dealt with over a period, but it is now worse than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A constituent of mine told me two days ago that he had 28 animals and he sold 18 of them. However, three weeks later, when he took eight more animals to the factory, he received £650 less <Col N="139" /> for them. This involved animals that were purchased last spring and this time last year and which were not overly expensive. What will happen to all family farms over the next number of months until the spring? In addition to the items mentioned in the motion, what action will the Minister, in consultation with his officials and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, take in relation to this issue?</P>
    <P>I got annoyed about this issue last week and the Ceann Comhairle asked me to leave the House as a result. However, thousands of small family farms are depending on an income over the winter from their investment. Aside from all the problems that have been mentioned by my colleagues, there is an issue in relation to income. For example, mothers must be able to provide the money required by their school going children. I urge the Minister not to produce a scheme in which the Minister, Deputy Ahern, would be involved in implementing that makes no sense. This happened previously. A scheme is required and compensation must be provided.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the issue of the incineration of animals must be addressed. We have a responsibility to deal with this matter. The Minister said that animals will be placed in cold storage, but I did not realise that animals were being buried here. Is the Minister entering negotiations with another country which has incinerators to take the relevant animals because they cannot be kept in cold storage forever?</P>
    <P>Regarding fallen animals, is it the case that all the SRM removed over the past 18 months from animals is in storage? If so, costs must arise and this cannot continue. We are all reasonable people and this issue must be addressed. In 1996, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Yates, made decisions which started the ball rolling in this area. Ireland is top of the league in terms of dealing with this problem and the Minister and the Government should not oppose the motion because the issue must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I was in the Department of Agriculture in 1996 when the BSE scare first hit Ireland. It was a very trying period for the officials, the Minister and me. I remember numerous occasions in the House when the issue was totally politicised. The Minister and his colleagues took every advantage of Ireland's plight at that time to damage the then Government and the resulting publicity reached places such as Moscow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one visit to Moscow, the Minister's current adviser, Mr. Moore, was with me when the chief veterinary officer, Mr. Avilov, decided to close the Russian market. He intended to issue a decree to that effect that day, but I convinced him to come to Ireland and see the controls that were in place before he did so. It was necessary to approach officials higher than the veterinary officer, but he had a pile of press clippings from <Col N="140" /> Ireland, most of which were about criticism of the Government by the then Opposition spokesperson, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and others who were ruthless.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Upton and I fully support the motion. There should be unanimity with regard to it. The issue should not be politicised and Deputy Penrose's approach was responsible. This issue is of national interest. The Minister knows that the Egyptian market was closed in the early 1990s and it took three years to have it reopened. It was closed again in 1996; they took our beef but they would not accept our live trade. It took a long time to resolve the problems with that market. It was going to be closed again, on the Minister's admission. It was stated in some press clipping that the Minister said it would take a year to reopen it. That would destroy the industry. It is worth about £200 million to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>We have to reassure consumers. We cannot tell them they will not get CJD if they eat meat because there is not enough scientific evidence yet to prove that conclusively. I agree totally with Deputy Upton's appeal for adequate research into the causes of CJD. However, we must tell consumers that we have very high standards of control in Ireland, which were first put in place in 1995 and have been implemented since then by the Minister and his colleagues. It should be clarified that since we have put those stringent controls in place, there has been no example of an animal born with BSE. It is very important to emphasise that to the market. All the cattle we are exporting at the moment are young.</P>
    <P>It is very important to maintain that high standard of credibility. As the motion points out, this is about the integrity of our beef industry. It is very important for us to emphasise there has been no case of BSE in any animal born since these stringent controls were put in place. The BSE crisis is a classic example of what happens when man messes around with nature.</P>
    <P>There has been only one case to date of CJD. However, a compensation package must be put in place, not only for the victims but also for the farmers involved who have been cleaned out. The Minister must also get a package from Europe. Deputy Yates got £200 million when he was Minister. The current Minister must get a proper compensation package from Europe to ensure the 100,000 beef farmers will not be forced out of business.</P>

      <P>In commending to the House amendment No. 1, I wish to thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate. In particular, I compliment Deputy Upton on her most extensive and thorough contribution in opening the debate. As the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and other speakers have said, the subject matter of the debate has involved issues of the most serious kind and the tone and content of contributions from all sides have been in keeping with that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> This debate has been most timely. It opened against the backdrop of acute consumer concerns about BSE in a number of European countries within recent weeks, unilateral responses to such concerns by a number of countries and the actions taken on foot of the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting, which were detailed by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in his speech to the House last evening. In the course of the debate, there have been further developments of major significance, underlining both the fluidity of the current situation and the need to restore stability as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the course of today, there have been announcements by both the EU's scientific steering committee &ndash; SSC &ndash; and the European Commission itself. The SSC had been asked by the Agriculture Council to consider the scientific justifications submitted by Italy, Spain, Austria and France for their unilateral actions. These included, in the case of Spain, a restriction on imports from Ireland. While much of the focus of the SSC's examination was directed at measures which had been introduced to restrict imports from France, its findings are of considerable relevance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>As far as imports from Ireland are concerned, the SSC found that no scientific justification had been put forward to justify the argument that importing cattle from Ireland could increase the geographical BSE risk in the importing country. The SSC considered that an increase in the number of BSE cases in Ireland does not provide new scientific elements in favour of import bans. Indeed, the SSC noted that in the context of an earlier thorough evaluation of BSE risk in Ireland, the outcome of which reflected very well on the rigour of our controls, it had itself predicted an increase in the reported incidence of BSE. I regard today's announcement by the SSC as very significant and as worthy of note by our trading partners.</P>
    <P>The European Commission announced earlier today that it has agreed a package of proposals in relation to the current BSE situation which is to go forward to the special Agriculture Council on 4 December 2000. These include&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed the Minister has not indicated his support for the Labour Party motion on BSE. The Government's amendment fails to address many of the points raised in the motion.</P>
      <P>The importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy has been recognised and registered in the Labour Party motion. Sustaining farm families, contributing to the Irish export market, promoting the expansion and development of Irish agriculture and recognising the benefits of Irish beef in a balanced diet were key considerations in moving this motion. However, public health and the safety of the food supply must take priority.</P>
      <P>The Minister revealed to the Dáil yesterday that there were 20 new cases of BSE in November, the highest in any single month so far recorded in Ireland. This brings the total for this year to 556. This problem is clearly not going away. While the percentage incidence in the entire cattle population is very small, what really counts is the number of cases in cattle born after 1996. I would like the Minister to tell the House the age of each infected animal detected with BSE and if he is happy that the precautions of 1990 and 1996 in relation to animal feed are now satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I quoted at some length from the Phillips report during my introductory speech. We must learn from the UK's mistakes. The chronology of the disease is spelled out very clearly in many of the MAFF documents and other published references.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the number of cases of BSE in the UK are dropping. While we have had meat and bone meal controls here since 1990, which were further strengthened in 1996, the number of Irish cases continues to rise. It was because of the ineffectiveness of the 1990 ban that it became essential to introduce more stringent controls in 1996.</P>
      <P>I call again for further controls now in relation to meat and bone meal in pig feed. This has been banned in the UK for all animal feed, including pigs and poultry. Why are we playing &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; here, when the UK and France, for example, have banned this product from their pigmeal?</P>
      <P>I welcome Commissioner Byrne's proposal today to impose a temporary ban on the use of meat and bone meal in all meat based animal feed. Today's move by Commissioner Byrne places added pressure on the Irish Government to impose a ban on meat and bone meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing situation that pertains at present is not a satisfactory way to ensure all meat and <Col N="143" /> bone meal is excluded. The effective policing of the licensing conditions is next to impossible to implement. Meat and bone meal should be banned now because it is the right thing to do, not because of any pressure from the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I referred yesterday to the importance of the high quality of Irish food to our markets at home and abroad. I referred, in particular, to the meaning of the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo;. What quality parameters are measured when there is a quality assured mark on a packet of bacon, for example? Does it reflect the raw materials used, the water content, the additives, the process or the safety? The word &ldquo;quality&rdquo; means very little unless some auditing system is laid down in law. Various organisations use quality systems and quality marks, but it is not clear what these quality systems mean. Legislation to ensure that any quality system is audited in the same way as food safety systems, such as HACCP, are audited is needed for credibility.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the need for the separation of food safety from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I know this was addressed at length by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. The protection of public health and the promotion of our food industry depend on this separation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle underlying food safety is the concept of farm to fork, a topic discussed at length when this House debated the National Beef Assurance Bill. A seamless process of auditing is what we endeavour to put in place. However, at present, legislation on on-farm inspections, animal health and, most significantly apropos this debate, animal feed are within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I endorse entirely the comments made by the Minister in relation to the Food Safety Authority, which is doing an excellent job. However, we should be very clear about the need for the separation of these areas of legislation.</P>
    <P>Given that we all subscribe to the principle of a seamless system of food safety, these areas, along with all other food safety responsibilities, should be within the remit of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. It follows that the resources to ensure the enforcement of that legislation will be provided to the authority. At present, staff who are responsible for food safety within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources have other responsibilities. It seems that now is an appropriate time to review the management of food safety in Ireland and to ensure there are no gaps or loopholes in the execution of the law and that the seamless operation, to which we pay lip service, should be activated.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by Commissioner Byrne's proactive stance in relation to BSE and I also welcome one of the recommendations by the Minister. Two major areas of change I have sought in this matter have been conceded in the last 48 <Col N="144" /> hours. The Minister has agreed to full testing of all animals, as sought by me last week and I welcome that. Commissioner Byrne has today indicated that meat and bonemeal is likely to be banned from all animal feed. This is also a very positive move.</P>
    <P>Central to the debate on BSE is accountability and traceability. From a public health point of view, traceability of any food product is essential. As a first, basic step to allow food product to be traced we need clear, unambiguous labelling. It is not good enough to allow companies to use sleight of hand labelling, creating the impression that a product is Irish made when it was simply packaged in Ireland. Only the very committed or concerned will be able to spot that a product with a company address in Cork, Galway or wherever, was produced in the Netherlands, Germany or elsewhere in Europe. This kind of smart alec, commercially street wise labelling damages confidence in our foods. If for whatever reason, be it commercial or public health, it is not considered appropriate to provide full information on the label it can only damage or discredit the industry when the truth emerges.</P>
    <P>The culture of secrecy and paternalism was identified in the Philips report in the UK as a major factor contributing to the escalation of BSE and consequently new variant CJD. The lessons of the UK should not be wasted on us. It was ten years after the first official case of BSE was diagnosed that it became clear that the disease could spread to humans. Misleading assurances became the hallmark of the management of BSE in the UK. Several damaging myths emerged early on in the saga there that later played a large part in allowing the disease to spread.</P>
    <P>There are key points we can draw from the British experience. There was a presumption that scrapie was a causative agent and that it would not cross the human species barrier. Later it transpired that scrapie was not the infective agent and we now know to our cost that the species barrier is a very uncertain preventative. The practice of feeding bovine protein to cows sparked an unstoppable chain of cannibalistic infection, later identified as new variant CJD in humans. Another key finding overlooked by scientists was that only a tiny dose was required to cause infection. Ignorance of this fact led to slaughterhouses routinely breaking the ban on BSE contaminated cattle material. It took until 1995 to realise that infective material had been entering the food chain in mechanically recovered meat &ndash; edible material sometimes scrapped from the spines of cows. The UK Government withheld the publication of scientific literature of the first report into BSE for six months.</P>
    <P>These are some of the mistakes or omissions that cost, and continue to cost dearly, the UK and all EU countries touched by BSE. The era of bland assurances has come to an end. Public trust <Col N="145" /> can only be established if communications about risk are frank and objective. To return to my first comment on this debate, the culture of secrecy and paternalism must end.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and I earnestly request the Government to support it. The motion is prompted by a concern to ensure the future of the beef industry, the credibility of Irish agriculture and, above all, the health of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In future years this debate, and the contribution to it by Deputy Upton, will sadly form part of a tribunal of inquiry. The Government had the opportunity today to explain why it took less than every step available to it. I do not wish to be too dramatic in what I have to say and I especially respect the commitment, political professionalism and agricultural experience of the Minister, but I would hate to think his contribution to agriculture would go down in history as being inextricably and indelibly linked with this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister should listen to the word of an expert. The health of the consumer and the beef industry are two sides of the one coin. No other country in Europe is as dependent on the beef industry. It is not only farmers who are involved, although they are at the beginning of this industrial chain. Workers in meat factories, people in transport and veterinary people are also involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware, as I am, how Private Members' motions are formulated. At the Cabinet meeting yesterday he was asked for his recommendation on Private Members' business. The amendment to the motion is drafted by him and his officials. He is sufficiently in the Fianna Fáil led Government to unilaterally decide now to withdraw his amendment, not only on the basis of what we have said in this debate but on what his former legal colleague and Attorney General said today at lunchtime and on what he will vote for at next Monday's meeting.</P>
      <P>The Minister must admit that he received a much more responsible and supportive Opposition than the previous Minister, Deputy Yates, received in 1996. We are not playing politics with this, but we want to be highly political on behalf of everybody. The Minister has the political authority not to press his amendment to a vote. We will give him the time to act accordingly. He and I have on occasion sat around the same table when such amendments are debated. His judgment on these matters will be respected by his Cabinet colleagues and supported by his backbench Members and colleagues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister listened not just to the erudite analysis by Deputy Upton but also to the contribution of a former Minister of State in at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Deenihan, who had to deal with the kind of problems in <Col N="146" /> Moscow he will confront. He knows how long it took to reopen the Egyptian market, having campaigned long and hard for it. I do not have to tell him things about the politics, mechanics and economics of agriculture and beef. He knows far more about them than I will ever know. However, since becoming Members of this House some time ago we have acquired political experience. I ask the Minister to use that experience, consider the wording of the motion and explain how he can square the contradiction of voting against something tonight when he will be urging his colleagues at the meeting of the Agriculture Council of Ministers next Monday to support Commissioner Byrne's proposals, one of which is identical to the motion.</P>
    <P>This country is and will remain more dependent on the beef industry than any other country in the EU, including applicant member states. Poland does not pose that kind of threat. It is essential we return to the primary observation that the health of the consumer and the beef industry are inextricably linked and that perception is reality, not the veil of secrecy, nor the scientific explanations and reassurances. They did not work in Britain and they are not working with the Egyptian authorities or anybody else.</P>
    <P>If we want a beef industry of a scale and kind that will ensure that the midlands and other parts of rural Ireland, which are critically dependent on beef as a primary component of the industry, we must unite the House tonight and state clearly and categorically that we are doing everything possible that can be done. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, attempted to say this but he contradicted himself. If the Government and its supporters press the amendment to water down this motion the Minister will not be able to say that on the evening of 29 November 2000 he did everything possible that could be done at that time in the light of available knowledge.</P>
    <P>Somebody in a tribunal in the future will ask the Minister if he did not realise the full importance of what he was doing all those years ago. The Minister, who has the authority and respect of his colleagues, will deeply regret that he did not have the courage not to press the amendment and to go with the unanimity of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to it.</P>
      <P>The ongoing delay by the Department of Education and Science in establishing a new school in Rathmore, County Kerry, is causing huge distress to staff, students and teachers in the three schools which are due to amalgamate to form the new school. I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in this House and, in spite of having received assurances from the Minister, I find myself forced to raise it again on the Adjournment. This issue was the subject of parliamentary questions on 5 April and 21 November and an Adjournment debate matter on 10 May, yet no progress has been made.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, the board of management and parents of children at the Presentation Convent primary school, Shrone national school and St. Joseph's national school agreed in principle to the proposed amalgamation of the three schools. Of the three schools, St. Joseph's is by far the one most in need of replacement. That is not to discredit the needs of the other schools. The condition of St. Joseph's national school is a hazard to teachers and students alike. The standard of accommodation there is so bad that the Department of Education and Science has accepted it is one of the worst school buildings in the country.</P>
      <P>The building was condemned two years ago by the environmental health officers of the Southern Health Board and the INTO. Yet, students are still expected to receive their primary education in these appalling conditions. I visited the school and was shocked by its level of disrepair. The toilet facilities are located outside the school in a building which is no more than a shed and is unfit for use. Children must cross the yard in all kinds of weather if they wish to use these facilities and there are no staff members nearby to ensure that the children are safe at all times and return to their classrooms. This is not the fault of the hard pressed teachers.</P>
      <P>The three classrooms in the school are completely inadequate and do not meet the standards which children and their teachers should expect in 2000. The roof of the main building leaks and is in constant need of repair. This is a source of distraction and discomfort for those using the building. It is not surprising that rats found a safe haven under the computer desks in all of the classrooms in the winter of 1998. The windows of the building are completely rotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions in the school are unbearable. Who, in this House, would tolerate their children <Col N="152" /> being educated in such conditions? No parent should be expected to send his or her child to such a school. In spite of constant representations by members of the local community and public representatives, we are not any closer to a decision on the school. Members of the school's board of management met the Minister in Dublin in June but, in spite of the tea and sympathy he offered, matters have not progressed. Did those people, who are dedicated to the students of St. Joseph's, waste their time and money coming to Dublin last June? Why has this urgent project not progressed an inch since then?</P>
    <P>The people of Rathmore have waited long enough; they demand and deserve action now. I call on the Minister to adopt a hands-on approach to the critical situation of the school. The Minister of State has probably come into the House with a prepared script. I appeal to him to send a senior departmental official down to the school in order that we can get together with the other agencies involved to resolve any difficulties which exist. I make that plea to the Minister of State this evening. If he cannot provide an assurance to the people of Rathmore this evening, provision must be made in next week's budget for the school.</P>
    <P>In spite of the wonderful work carried out by parents and staff, the education of the pupils of St. Joseph's school is suffering. This is grossly unfair and cannot be allowed to continue. We have had enough bluff and bluster and need action now. I implore the Minister to do something for the people of Rathmore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this case is that the management authorities of Rathmore boys' national school applied to the Department of Education and Science for funding towards upgrading and refurbishing the existing facilities. A technical inspection of the school building was subsequently carried out by the Department's architectural service.</P>
      <P>Following further consideration of the matter, the question of rationalisation of primary schools in the Rathmore area was then raised and discussions were held between the Department and the various interested parties. Agreement was subsequently reached between the Department and the relevant school authorities to amalgamate into a new school on a greenfield site.</P>
      <P>A number of sites were identified and the Department requested the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts as the Department's agent in relation to the acquisition of sites, to pursue the purchase of a suitable site for the new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It emerged subsequently that issues relating to site access require further clarification. In that regard, the Department, in consultation with the <Col N="153" /> Office of Public Works, has requested a consultant architect to carry out a feasibility study into the various options for access to the site.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that as soon as the site is acquired, architectural planning for the building project will proceed as quickly as possible. The Department is fully committed to the provision of a new primary school in Rathmore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I have furnished details of the name and address of the young person whose case I am raising. The maintenance grant payable to third level students amounts to £49 per week and the income limit for families with four dependants is £20,200. The joint income of the family concerned exceeds the income limit by £3,726 per annum.</P>
      <P>On 14 November I outlined in detail as best I could the health problems of the family and it is with regret that it is necessary to repeat them tonight. This young man's father suffers from a tumour in a gland under his brain which has required a number of very serious, life threatening operations. The mother had a stroke, has a problem with a cervical disc in her neck, has a serious weakness on one side and has serious visual impairment. She suffers from diabetes and will be on insulin the rest of her life. Both parents have serious ongoing health problems. Neither has a medical card because they are over the income limit, which is very wrong.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the matter with the parents, both of whom have been advised for health reasons not to work. However, they are good, outgoing people who fully enjoy life in spite of their health problems. They are hard working and do not want to draw the dole, sickness benefit or anything else.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue on 14 November and was amazed by the prompt reply of the Minister on 17 November saying he was turning down the request. The Minister said the young man was allowed a grant last year because the father had been out of work following his operations. This year, because the father has returned to full time work the young man has been refused the grant. The parents could take the easy option and stay at home in bed, get the grant and also get medical cards. However, they do not want to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister should do what he can and allow them the maintenance grant. We talk about our fine young people and we encourage people to continue their education. This man is most anxious to do that, but given the family's financial difficulties it is placing an enormous strain on the family. I have dealt with the fine people in the Department of Education and Science and I fully respect the Minister and <Col N="154" /> the Minister of State. I appeal to the Ministers to allocate the grant.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how far the Minister's discretion runs, but there is something seriously wrong if the Department is to hold a firm line with strict rules and regulations with total rigidity. Surely there is a sense of fair play, justice and right in the country. If the reply tonight is negative I intend taking it up with the Ombudsman and I recommend the family bring it to a court of law. However, they are easy going and good people. This is a matter of common sense and fair play and I appeal to the Minister and the Department to make the payment.</P>
    <P>I have been polite in what I have said as the family does not want hassle, and I have refrained from using abusive language. We are talking about treating people fairly and correctly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, the candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his/her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians where applicable. Certain social welfare and health board payments are not taken into account in the calculation of reckonable income.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in this case, the candidate's parents suffer from ill-health and that medical expenses have been incurred by the family. I fully sympathise with the family in this regard. However, the terms of the maintenance grants scheme, which are uniformly applied, explicitly provide for assessment on the basis of gross income and do not allow for personal expenses, such as medical expenses, to be deducted from reckonable income when assessing a candidate's application.</P>
      <P>Offaly County Council, the body charged with the administration of the scheme in this case, has confirmed to my Department that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limits set down in the scheme in order to qualify for a maintenance grant. However, the student to whom the Deputy refers did qualify for a fees only grant and in this regard he will be awarded a grant of £292 in respect of the charge for student services, registration and examinations.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is satisfied that the reckonable income in this case has been correctly assessed. The terms and conditions of the student support scheme are of general application and accordingly it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases such as this. Regarding reckonable income the Deputy is aware of the rules and what has been happening in the Department in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> In the current financial year expenditure on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million. In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, the Minister, Deputy Woods, announced on 11 November that he was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to the Minister by the end of March 2001.</P>
    <P>Also, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. The Minister recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised this matter with me, both in the House and subsequently, and I spoke to the officials in the Department about the case. My understanding is that the Department is still examining the case and has not reached finality. I will make further inquiries tomorrow and will ensure the Deputy is contacted at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This threatened industrial dispute among casualty staff in Beaumont Hospital is really born out of frustration. Nurses in the accident and emergency department are at the sharp end and are bearing the brunt of the frustrations which have built up through a system which has not been adequately resourced. The reality is that Beaumont Hospital is short between 100 and 150 beds. We have seen a 50% increase in its waiting lists in the past three years, resulting in huge pressures on the accident and emergency department which is dealing with well over 1,000 patients every week. Currently, more than one in six of those patients are in the accident and emergency department for over 24 hours. Over the weekend one patient remained there for 96 hours waiting for admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Typically the numbers waiting for admission in October was 27, three times the number waiting <Col N="156" /> for admission one year ago. We are seeing growing pressures and nursing staff are trying to cope with 150 patients coming in every day while having 27 patients on trolleys for admission, making it almost impossible to conduct the professional job the nurses and doctors are trying to deliver.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January this year one in four nurses in the accident and emergency department have left Beaumont Hospital, which is evident throughout the hospital. The Minister kindly sent me the report on manpower nurse needs and Beaumont is struggling much more than any other hospital. It has 113 vacancies, 10% of its total staffing. It lost 156 nurses last year.</P>
    <P>This is according to the report of the Health Service Employers' Agency, which the Minister kindly sent me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in September but the vacancies are now down to 57.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is serious. If the Minister is looking for quick answers he must seek to provide step-down facilities and fill the two accident and emergency consultant posts. I look forward to hearing the Minister commit himself to the appointment of at least two emergency consultant posts in Beaumont. He needs to seriously look at step-down facilities to free up beds. Some 72 beds are either blocked or closed and this is creating tensions. This is a cry for help from nursing staff who are delivering a quality service. I hope the Minister can deal with this problem. They are at the sharp end.</P>
      <P>Ten complaints are being received per month concerning conditions. They describe cases of people getting up to go to the toilet and on their return their trolley was gone due to the sheer volume of people coming through.</P>
      <P>This is no way to deliver a professional service. I ask the Minister to give this problem his personal attention. This is not a localised matter. The accident and emergency department of the Mater Hospital is also under severe pressure due to a shortage of facilities. That hospital's waiting list is up by about 40% in three years. There are serious problems on the northside. I appeal to the Minister to develop a strategy with those professionals on the northside who are only too willing to do that. The resources are there but it needs a coherent plan to respond to the need.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>News reports today refer to proposed industrial action in Beaumont Hospital accident and emergency department because of work pressures and staff shortages. I understand that the ballot was only completed yesterday evening and that both <Col N="157" /> INO and SIPTU members have voted for industrial action.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that a special pre-arranged hospital board meeting is taking place tomorrow, 30 November. This meeting had been arranged prior to the ballot of nursing staff and with their knowledge. Hospital management had asked accident and emergency staff, including nurses, for their proposals on how to alleviate pressures in the department. These proposals are to be discussed at tomorrow's board meeting &ndash; and there is to be feedback at a staff meeting on Friday next, 1 December. It should be possible with co-operation between management, medical and nursing staff to resolve the situation at local level.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the House that the hospital has a total of 57 nursing vacancies at present. This is a 50% improvement on the position at 30 September 2000, when there were 113.5 vacancies. That clarifies that there has been a significant improvement since September. This is proof of the success of ongoing recruitment campaigns. Thirty two beds have been opened in the last two weeks, leaving 35 beds closed. All remaining beds will be opened by January 2001.</P>
    <P>More generally in relation to nursing shortages, the Health Service Employers' Agency carried out a national survey of the position at 30 September 2000. This found that the overall vacancy figure stood at 1,388 vacancies. However, the net vacancy position stood at 476 when account is taken of agency nurses and overtime working.</P>
    <P>The survey found again that difficulties largely relate to the Dublin area and the major Dublin acute hospitals account for a large percentage of the vacancies in the eastern region. These hospitals have engaged in a successful international recruitment drive. However, it was noted by the HSEA that the full impact of recruitment campaigns is not reflected in the survey as many of the nurses recruited abroad had not started work at that time. The Beaumont experience as stated above is an example of nurses beginning to come on stream.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am pleased to inform the House that earlier today I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas. The initiative includes a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service which will come into operation on 1 February 2001.</P>
    <P>The scheme is designed to introduce greater flexibility in working arrangements for nurses with family responsibilities and other commitments. Fees for &ldquo;back-to-nursing&rdquo; courses are being abolished with immediate effect. In addition, nurses and midwives undertaking such <Col N="158" /> courses will, for the first time ever, be paid a salary. The intention behind this initiative is to remove all financial obstacles in the path of nurses and midwives who wish to return to practice. From the current academic year, all nurses studying for the post-registration higher diploma in sick children's nursing will have their fees refunded. They will also receive an enhanced salary while in training. This measure is specifically designed to ease recruitment difficulties facing the children's hospitals in particular. It follows similar initiatives taken by me earlier this year on behalf of student public health nurses and student midwives. The number of available places on specialist nursing courses, including accident and emergency, is being expanded. To encourage more nurses into specialised areas of clinical practice, including accident and emergency, nurses undertaking specific courses will now receive full pay while doing so. They will also have their course fees paid in return for a commitment to continue working in the specialist area for a specified period following completion of the course.</P>
    <P>Funding is being provided to the HSEA to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad. Nurses from the Philippines and certain other non-EU countries are required to undertake such placements prior to registration. A major advertising campaign aimed at attracting qualified nurses and midwives back to work is being launched tomorrow. This campaign will make use of radio and print media advertising to market nursing as a career with the specific objective of encouraging nurses and midwives back into the system.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a package of investment costing £25 million to alleviate service pressures on the acute hospital sector comprising first, the appointment of an additional 27 consultants to work in accident and emergency departments and ensure early&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be allocating a block number to the ERHA once An Comhairle has that situation resolved. Obviously the major teaching hospitals will do well under the allocation. The contracting of over 500 additional nursing home places for patients who are being discharged from acute hospitals, thereby increase the capacity of the hospitals to address the problem of inappropriate use of beds in acute hospitals. That is available to Beaumont now and has helped improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the winter initiative, I have also provided £1.5 million this year for the purchase of medical aids and appliances for older people to facilitate the discharge of older persons from hospital and also support older people in remaining in their homes. I have also initiated a national <Col N="159" /> review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not completed. It is being carried out in consultation with the social partners. It is expected that the second phase of the review will be completed next spring. Beaumont Hospital as part of the accident and emergency initiative received in 1998 an additional £200,000 of which £170,000 was used to employ additional nurses and £30,000 for medical staff; in 1999 an additional £200,000 capital specifically for revamping the accident and emergency department &ndash; the final cost of this project was £300,000; in 2000 an additional £240,000 to replace and increase the equipment levels in the accident and emergency department.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan I have approved a major refurbishment and equipment replacement programme for Beaumont Hospital totalling £26.469 million over the next four years. This is the first time that Beaumont Hospital has had such a programme since it opened in 1987. The equipment programme will cover all major areas of the hospital on a priority replacement programme identified by the hospital and the refurbishment programme will include civil and mechanical works, upgrading of clinics, recladding and reroofing of the hospital and major upgrading of the reception area.</P>
      <P>It should be possible to resolve the situation in Beaumont Hospital at local level with co-operation between management, medical and nursing staff. I appeal to all involved to resolve this issue through dialogue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sunday, 5 November, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, announced details of expenditure on heritage projects under the national development plan costing £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's statement work <Col N="160" /> will be carried out on 15 major centres throughout the country but it is unbelievable that not one of the designated major projects is located north of a Dublin-Galway line. How can a Minister or, indeed, anyone justify such a serious omission, leaving virtually half of the country overlooked and ignored? There are numerous archaeological and heritage sites along with many historic buildings in the northern half of the country that would qualify for consideration.</P>
    <P>There is one such building in Donegal, namely, Doe Castle that is the subject of this debate. Doe Castle is located in one of the most spectacular locations in Donegal, near Creeslough on the banks of deep Sheephaven Bay. The castle is steeped in history and has for many centuries been the seat of the MacSweeney Clan or Clann tSuibhne. Many of the Princes of Donegal were fostered there as far back as the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 17th century, Eoghan Rua O'Neill arrived there with Spanish veterans and swept through Ulster. The castle also provided shelter and sustenance for the survivors of the Spanish Armada.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and regrettably, it has fallen into disrepair in recent times. Nevertheless, it attracts approximately 5,000 visitors a month during the summer season. People from many parts of the world to visit this most historic site and building.</P>
    <P>In recent years the heritage section of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has undertaken a major programme of works at Doe Castle, which, when complete, will see the restoration of the Tower House. These works will conserve the medieval remains of the structure but, more importantly, this work has provided sheltered sanctuary for the priceless ancient MacSweeney of Doe tomb slab.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 the Sweeney Clan organisation took a keen interest in the restoration of the castle. Various meetings with Dúchas officials have conveyed the Sweeney Clan views on the future development of Doe Castle and Dúchas has so far expended a considerable sum of money on the Tower House, with the sole purpose of providing a safe keep for the invaluable Sweeney tomb slab. The Minister has already indicated to me in a letter that at this stage there are no plans to undertake further works at the site. The re-roofing of the Great Hall at the castle must be a priority. This is absolutely essential to accommodate the extra visitors during guided tours. The castle will not reach its full potential unless the Great Hall is re-roofed. We would not get a proper return on money already spent. I am reliably informed that a sum of £200,000 would be sufficient to complete the re-roofing project and bring the main part of the castle back to its former glory so that it can assume its rightful place in the heritage of County Donegal. The Sweeney <Col N="161" /> Clan have on a voluntary basis provided tourist reception at the castle over the past four years and have recorded visitors from every continent. This indicates the potential of Doe Castle as a massive tourist attraction to Donegal and the north west.</P>
    <P>When the castle is completed it could also serve as a centre for the arts in the county. It could accommodate banquets such as are held in Bunratty. It would be an ideal venue for business and video conferencing. To leave Doe Castle at the end of the present phase of what we all must admire as a fine piece of restoration work by the craftsmen of Dúchas would be an injustice to those very same craftsmen and architects who have done such a splendid job. Let us complete the job properly, particularly as there is only a small sum required to make Doe Castle once more a real living castle. Future generations will surely be grateful that in the year 2000 a Government Department really cared about the heritage of its citizens. I appeal to the Minister to allocate the additional funding from the £100 million announced by her on 5 November last and bring Doe Castle back to its former glory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the programme of restoration works that have taken place to date at Doe Castle. To fully understand the reasons behind the works scheduled at Doe, I will briefly refer to the history of the castle.</P>
      <P>It is a four storey Tower House, built early in the 16th century in Sheephaven Bay by the MacSweeney and foster father of Red Hugh O'Donnell. Over the next two centuries the MacSweeneys lost and regained the castle a number of times. Some time in the late 18th century the castle came into the possession of George Vaughan Harte whose initials and coat of arms can be found above the entrance. His descendants occupied the castle for about a century and during that period they carried out extensive works and repairs to it. The Harte family moved to Kilderry near Muff in 1864 and the estate was purchased by Stewart of Ards, who subsequently let it to various tenants before it was finally abandoned in 1890 and left to fall into ruin. It was bought by the Irish Land Commission in 1932 and vested in the Office of Public Works in July 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, undertook to carry out an extensive programme of conservation works. This entailed a major restoration of the medieval tower house, which was seen as the primary structure associated with the castle, and the conservation of the MacSweeney grave slab. This grave slab, a unique feature associated <Col N="162" /> with Doe Castle is highly decorated. It is possibly dated from around 1544 and is carved with an elaborate eight pointed cross and also depicts various animals. Because of the very elaborate carvings, it is believed to have marked the grave of one of the 16th century MacSweeneys. This slab was found damaged in the nearby Ballymacsweeney graveyard and was brought into the castle for protection in 1968. It was repaired and mounted on the wall of the castle but over a period of time it deteriorated as a result of both weathering and the actions of souvenir hunters. Specialist conservation work has been carried out to the grave slab and it will be replaced in the Tower House when it is fully restored. This will allow it to be displayed in an appropriate manner. A replica of this grave slab has been commissioned and placed in the graveyard at Ballymacsweeney.</P>
    <P>Completed work to date includes the re-roofing of the medieval tower with Irish oak and stone slates. Three oak floors have been fitted, together with an oak stairs, which will allow access to the second floor. Lighting has also been installed. Dúchas staff are continuing work on the outside walls of the tower. The poor condition of the masonry requires the dismantling of some sections prior to re-building. Scaffolding has been erected around the Tower House, which allows for all sections of the tower to be examined carefully to ensure that a complete and comprehensive conservation of the walls is achieved. Staff are currently preparing the tower house for plastering in the spring of 2001. I am conscious that this work is taking a long time but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate this is unavoidable given that only experienced personnel can carry out the delicate and specialist nature of the work involved. The Deputy will be aware that these works have required considerable expenditure over the past five years. In this context, approximately £400,000 has been spent to date. Additional funds estimated at £200,000 have been designated for the completion of these works by early 2002. As I mentioned earlier, our primary aim with regard to Doe Castle was to conserve the medieval remains of the structure. This will have been achieved when the works on the tower house are completed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that over several years I have allocated considerable resources to the Donegal region, which will add to and enhance considerably to the county's tourism potential. As well as funding for Doe Castle, considerable resources were allocated to projects such as the restoration of Donegal Castle and to Newmills Corn and Flax Mills. With regard to Donegal Castle, I have again committed further resources under the national development plan for the addition of toilet facilities, which will enhance and complete the visitor facilities at the <Col N="163" /> castle. I am sure the Deputy appreciates that all these works have contributed significantly to the tourism potential of the Donegal region.    </P>
    <P>My Department has many demands on its limited resources and, given the level of expenditure <Col N="164" /> in the Donegal region in recent years, the additional funding needed to fully restore Doe Castle cannot be justified at this time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 21.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 November 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the transposition of Council Directive 96/29/Euratom on 13 May 1996, new obligations have been placed on employers to arrange for the minimization of radon in the workplace and to protect workers and the general public from high levels of radon. The relevant order is the Radiological Protection Act, 1999 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 (S.I. No. 125 of 2000). It is the responsibility of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to enforce the legislation.</P>
      <P>To enable implementation of the order there was a need when drafting the legislation to ensure that there were adequate radon measurement services available within the country operating to a satisfactory standard. At the time the order was prepared, it was my understanding that the RPII was the only Irish based service provider capable of carrying out the services necessary. For this reason, the RPII can seek accreditation from the National Accreditation Board under Article 24 of the order. Any other service provider may seek the same accreditation.</P>
      <P>The measurement of radon concentrations is critical in determining whether a workplace falls within the scope of the order. It would have been meaningless to draft legislation, which relied on the provision of a service, which was not available to the required standard in the State. I should add that, the RPII have informed me that they would inform employers contacted of alternative accredited measurement services when issuing a direction to employers to carry out radon measurements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, I believe adequate provision has been made to avoid a conflict between the RPII's role as regulator of radon in the workplace and its separate involvement in carrying out radon measurement services. In the circumstances, I do not propose to make any changes in existing arrangements at present but the matter will be reviewed if there is evidence of <Col N="166" /> adequate alternative services to serve the future needs of employers in the country.</P>

      <P>The issue of air passenger rights is at <Col N="167" /> present being addressed at European level. An EU charter of air passenger rights was introduced earlier this year following extensive consultation with all interested parties &ndash; including airlines, passengers, airports, travel agents and disabled people. The charter was formally adopted by Transport Ministers last month and the extensive work programme at EU level arising from this measure is already under way. My Department has been and continues to be fully involved in this process and as part of its involvement, has engaged in a consultation process involving all interested parties.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has adopted a two-phased approach to deal with passenger rights issues, specifically through voluntary commitments by the air transport sector and further Community legislation. The Commission's aim is to achieve a balance between legislation and a voluntary code and, therefore, the level of legislation required will depend to a degree on the extent of the voluntary commitments reached.</P>
      <P>The Commission has proposed a voluntary code for adoption by European airlines which covers in particular: improvements to service quality; adequate care for delayed passengers in order to minimise inconvenience to them; and simple procedures for lodging complaints and mechanisms for settling disputes out-of-court. The Commission intends to implement legislation which will enable delayed passengers to continue their journeys under good conditions, by giving them the right either to reimbursement of the cost of the ticket or to an alternative flight; create new rights for passengers, by setting minimum requirements for contracts in air travel; and give passengers the information they need to make well-founded choices between airlines. The Commission hopes that the voluntary code will be agreed throughout the member states by May of next year and that the necessary community legislation will be in place by the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>I believe that the measures contained in both the voluntary code and the legislative programme proposed by the European Commission are sufficiently comprehensive to address current concerns in relation to passenger rights. I am sure that the aviation and travel industries will play a responsible role in this initiative for the good of air travel as a whole. My Department will continue to co-operate with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to ensure that the interests of consumers of air services are well catered for.</P>

      <P>My strategy for Aer Lingus is based on the sectoral objectives and the shareholder mandate outlined in my Department's Statement of Strategy dated April 1998. The cornerstone of that strategy was and remains that the airline must continue to operate in accordance with strict commercial criteria so as to secure the company's future as a strong and viable airline providing air services with all our main tourism and export markets.</P>
      <P>My strategy has not been changed arising from the proposed flotation of the airline. I am committed to implementing the Government's decision of 14 December 1999 in relation to the Aer Lingus IPO once the present industrial relations issues have been resolved. The precise timing for the IPO will be influenced by market conditions and, of course, the enactment of the enabling legislation.</P>

      <P>The educational requirements for the Certificate of Professional Competence are set out in the Annex to European Council Directive 96/26/EC on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator. The directive allows each member state to designate its own national body or authority to set down course durations and standards, and requires for a written examination for the Certificate of Professional Competence. Consequently, standards and course durations tend to vary between member states while meeting the minimum educational requirements for the CPC.</P>
      <P>Following concerns over discrepancies in courses between certain member states, Directive 98/76/EC was adopted, amending Directive 96/26/EC. This allows a member state to require that a person normally living there who obtains a CPC in another member state may have to sit an additional examination in his or her country of residence before that CPC can be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national body appointed for the CPC in Ireland is the Chartered Institute of Transport. Any person normally resident in the Republic who obtains a CPC by passing the Northern <Col N="169" /> Ireland examination may be required to sit an additional examination in accordance with Chartered Institute of Transport standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union provides assistance of a technical and financial nature to eastern European countries aimed at improving the level of nuclear safety in those countries. The objective of the EU's programme of assistance for these countries, which is largely implemented under the Phare and Tacis programmes, is, in the short-term, to upgrade the operational safety of nuclear reactors and the nuclear regulatory regime. In the longer term, the objective is to bring about the decommissioning of those nuclear power plants which cannot be upgraded to western safety standards.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the EU programmes of assistance is the responsibility of the EU Commission. The Commission is responsible for ensuring the efficient and cost-effective implementation of the programmes and has systems in place for monitoring the results of the various projects implemented. In turn, the Commission's management of these programmes is audited by the EU Court of Auditors. The EU Court of Auditors has been critical of the Commission's approach in the implementation and monitoring of projects under these programmes and has recommended remedial steps which the Commission should adopt.</P>
      <P>As part of the wider international co-operation in this area, the EU has been instrumental in making available Community funds for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and for the decommissioning of three high-risk nuclear power plants in EU Accession countries &ndash; Ignalina in Lithuania; Bohunice in Slovakia, and Kozluduy in Bulgaria which have been identified for closure. Ireland, in common with other member states, has already provided funds for the Chernobyl shelter project over and above our share of the EU contribution, and has, earlier this year, pledged to provide further assistance to this project. Ireland, like other member states also, has pledged to provide financial assistance to the decommissioning support funds in respect of the three nuclear power plants mentioned above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and the Igna<Col N="170" /> lina Decommissioning Support Funds are managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to whom all contributions are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs. No Irish Government funds are paid directly to the Ukraine or to any third party. The EBRD is an international financial institution which is responsible for ensuring the sound and prudent management of the funding. It makes use of an independent panel of experts to closely monitor the implementation of both projects. Some of these funds would be used for the development of robotic technology which is required when working in high radiation fields where human access is precluded.</P>
    <P>As to possible diversion of funds to the nuclear arms race, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is designed to prevent this. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) implements a safeguards regime to police compliance with the treaty. In conclusion, therefore, it can be stated that there are institutions established to police implementation of the assistance programmes mentioned above and to guard against corruption and misuse of funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex matter and the supporting analysis is on my Department's website. The existing gas network in Ireland is owned and operated by Bord Gáis Éireann. It comprises of the Scotland-Ireland interconnector and the onshore gas transmission system which delivers gas to customers. The <Col N="171" /> charge for transporting gas on BGE's system is currently calculated on a fully postalised basis. This means that the same charge is made for delivering gas through the interconnector to any point on the network, regardless of the geographic location of the delivery point.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to change this method of calculating tariffs because it would be unfair to continue to use it in circumstances where there will be other sources of gas supply entering the country. Take, for example, a gas customer on the BGE system who was buying gas through a different import pipeline, or through a pipeline bringing gas from the Corrib field onto the BGE system. Such a customer who was paying the existing fully postalised tariff would be making a contribution towards the existing interconnector, even though the customer wasn't using it.</P>
      <P>The new method proposed for calculating transmission tariffs is called Irish Entry/Postalised Exit. This would involve individual tariffs for entry or supply on to the Irish onshore transmission system, and a postalised rate for delivery from the point of entry to any point on the onshore system, regardless of location. Postalised transmission tariffs carry an implicit subsidy between customers in different locations. For example, because Dublin in an entry point, a customer in Dublin will pay more than the actual cost of delivery, and the surplus is offset against the extra cost of delivery to, say, Cork or Limerick.</P>
      <P>Any system of postalisation has the potential for distortion in circumstances where a supplier could bypass the postalised system and supply a customer direct. For example, the operator of a new pipe to Dublin could charge a price a fraction below the combined Scotland-Ireland interconnector and the onshore postalised price which would be attractive to consumers.</P>
      <P>However, the difference between the actual cost of delivery by that operator and the price charged would not be offset against the higher cost of delivery to other parts of the country but would go directly to the operator. In order to avoid this happening, the Brattle Group, economic consultants engaged to advise me on the tariff arrangements, has recommended that a public service levy be introduced to eliminate the potential for distortion which could arise in this situation. The difference between the competitive cost of delivery, and the postalised tariff, would be the amount of the public service levy. This is proposed in order to level the playing field between pipelines, whether they deliver directly to customers, or deliver to customers using the postalised system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to stress that this proposal is not aimed at preventing any particular pipeline from being built. After security of gas supplies, the most important consideration is to ensure that the most cost effective option is chosen for the pipelines which are built to bring gas to Ireland. The levy is designed to <Col N="172" /> ensure that only the most efficient pipes are built. This is in the best long-term interests of gas consumers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the allocation of costs adopted by BGE in preparing the indicative figures for the proposed levy, as I am concerned to ensure that the level of the charge should accurately reflect the costs in the system. I would also like to say that before such a levy could be introduced, primary legislation would be necessary to enable me to impose the public service obligation involved, and the necessary notification and clearance procedures would have to be carried out with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>The accident was the subject of a public inquiry held in the Four Courts in June 1953 before the late Judge Thomas Teevan S.C. The inquiry found that the Aer Lingus DC 3 aircraft on a scheduled flight from Dublin to Bermingham on 1 January crashed at Spernal near Bermingham with the loss of the aircraft. There were no fatalities.</P>
      <P>The inquiry found that the captain was responsible for the accident by allowing both engines cut out by feeding from the same fuel tank which ran dry. The captain's license was endorsed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the effect of which prohibited him from flying passenger aircraft. The license was restored without prejudice in 1977. The late captain's family now seek the quashing of the verdict of the court and officials of my Department are in contact with them. These discussions should shortly result in an agreed mechanism for a structured review of the issues which are of concern to the family.</P>

Such projects are best considered when they are developed in line with appropriate land use planning policy and practice so that the appropriate scale of project is put in place to justify the capital and ongoing operating costs.</P>
      <P>I understand that rail developments in the Cork area are currently being considered by consultants who have been engaged by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council to draw up the Cork Strategic Plan 2000-2020. The consultants recently issued an interim report which, among other things, contains proposals that the area along the corridor from Blarney via Cork to Midleton be rezoned for major development which could tie in with rail development proposals.</P>
      <P>I informed the delegation that the strategy being adopted by the consultants accords, in principle, with my position on the development of major public transport projects. However, further work needs to be done, such as detailed cost/benefit analysis, an analysis of funding options, feasibility and demand analysis to demonstrate whether the proposed developments along the public transport corridor would be sufficient to justify undertaking the rail project.</P>

      <P>My Department provided funding towards the costs of the &ldquo;Total Renewable Energy Resource in Ireland&rdquo; report prepared jointly by ESB International and the UK consultancy firm, Energy Technology Support Unit, ETSU, and supported under the Euro<Col N="176" /> pean Union's ALTENER programme. The report was published in 1998.</P>
      <P>With regard to our wave energy resource, the report concluded that Ireland has a considerable potential for generating electricity from wave power. However, the establishment of a pilot plant and further research are needed to advance this technology to commercial operation.</P>
      <P>I have secured funding of £40 million under the national development plan for energy related research, development and demonstration. The funding will be used to devise a strategy for the energy area in general which will consist of a mixture of the following approaches: a public good fully funded research programme in co-operation with universities and research institutions; a shared cost programme to be carried out with industry to exploit commercial opportunities; and international collaborative research.</P>
      <P>The further development of wave energy can be expected to feature under one or other of these approaches. The Irish Energy Centre is currently preparing a three-year research and development work programme with the objective of achieving the most effective outcome at least cost. The programme will be funded as part of the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme.</P>

      <P>Since 1995 my Department has organised a number of competitions under the alternative energy requirement programme to increase the installed electricity generation capacity from renewable resources. To date a total of 96 megawatts have been installed under this programme. In addition, successful Irish projects under the EU THERMIE Measure have been awarded contracts to sell renewables based electricity to the ESB. Some 15 megawatts have been installed under this initiative to date.</P>
      <P>In September 1999 I set an increased target of 500 MWe of renewable energy based electricity generating plant to be delivered by 2, 005. It is estimated this will increase the production of electricity from all renewable energy sources from 6% to 12% of total electricity production.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, removed any legal impediment to independent participation in generating and selling green electricity. Consequently, it is now open to the private sector to grow the market beyond the ambitious minimum target that I have set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 500 megawatt target will come primarily from wind energy which is the most competitive of renewable energy based electricity production methods at this time. In that context, I established a renewable energy strategy group to consider the obstacles to the increased deployment of wind <Col N="177" /> energy technologies. The group's report, including recommendations on how the funds secured by me under the national development plan for renewables should be invested, is currently being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>On the public transport front, the Public Transport Development Strategy 2000-2006 comprises two main components.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Greater Dublin Area &ndash; £1.585 billion</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The transformation of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area is being brought about through the introduction of a light rail system, substantial investment in suburban rail, a major enhancement of the bus network and much improved integration of services;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Regional Public Transport Programme &ndash; £650 million</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>A regional public transport programme to improve the quality of public transport services, particularly in large urban areas. Of this £650 million, £500 million will be used to implement the rail safety programme, as well as a major mainline rail renewal programme which will also increase the passenger capacity of the network and enhance the quality of service to the public.</P>
      <P>In relation to the aviation sector, the aviation market in Europe is now fully liberalised and it is a matter for airlines to decide which services they wish to offer and which routes they wish to operate. In addition, member states may impose a public service obligation on a route, which is not considered commercially viable by the airlines, if it is considered vital for the economic development of a region.</P>
      <P>Currently four PSO routes are in operation, linking the airports in Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Kerry with Dublin. I intend establishing two new PSO routes linking Derry and Knock with Dublin and these routes will come into operation in January 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with Aer Rianta's success in growing passenger numbers at Cork Airport in recent years. Over the past five years, traffic at Cork rose by 55% to 1.5 million passengers in 1999. For the first ten months of this year, passenger numbers have grown by a further 13% at Cork compared to the same period last year. These growth rates have exceeded expectations and have understandably, created new pressures on the airport's infrastructure.</P>
      <P>However, Aer Rianta is proceeding with its major development plans at Cork Airport to cater for this and future growth in passenger traffic including an expansion of the terminal which will increase terminal capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers per annum by 2003. Further expansion is planned thereafter to handle growth up to five million passengers per annum in the medium and long-term.</P>
      <P>In the meantime Aer Rianta are engaged in ongoing consultations with airport users to identify and implement short-term measures to alleviate congestion. These include a better spread of flight times, especially holiday charters, to optimise the use of existing facilities.</P>

      <P>The suffering of the people of Iraq, especially children, and the problems in implementing the United Nations humanitarian programmes in Iraq continue to be of deep concern to the Government. We have held discussions with the various parties at the UN and would hope that further progress will have been made on this issue by the time that we take our seat on the Security Council in January. As a member of the council, we will be considering the situation in Iraq both in the light of developments and also in line with Government policy. Ireland stands by its obligation under the UN Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>We have consistently raised within the United Nations, and the EU, the urgent need to improve the conditions of the general population in Iraq. The Security Council clearly needs to take full account of the grave humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people in its further consideration of the sanctions issue. Our policy has been to advocate greater reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. The Taoiseach and I raised this issue with the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Washington in March, and urged the United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to seek to reduce the delays on needed medicines and spare parts for infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The EU, in a common statement at an open debate of the Security Council in April on the question of sanctions in general, made clear our view that sanctions should be carefully defined and focused and should minimise the negative humanitarian impact on the general population and particularly the most vulnerable sectors. The Council also discussed the streamlining of procedures for approving humanitarian exemptions, as well as a study on how to avoid negative collateral effects of sanctions on third countries. These are important elements which have guided our considerations on continuing UN sanctions programmes.</P>
      <P>In response to widespread international concern, the Security Council, acting under the provisions of Resolution 1284, has unconditionally removed the ceiling on the export of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council has also introduced an accelerated procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies, in operation since the beginning of March. Under this streamlined procedure some two billion dollars worth of contracts for food, education, medical, agricultural, water and sanitation <Col N="182" /> sectors have been approved on a basis of notification of the Council. The Council also agreed to make a greater allocation for spare parts for the ailing Iraqi oil industry, doubling this budget to $1.2 billion.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the UN Secretary General in his report to the Council of 8 September expressed concern about the negative impact on the rehabilitation of Iraqi infrastructure of holds and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme.</P>
    <P>The basis for the continued imposition of UN sanctions on Iraq remains the Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN Commissions appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. I would call upon the Government of Iraq to comply with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1284 also provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission &ndash; UNMOVIC &ndash; and full compliance with all conditions imposed by the Security Council. We would wish to see the necessary co-operation from Baghdad to allow greater progress to be made on the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of sanctions. This would be a welcome and a major step towards the return of Iraq to full participation in the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government has also addressed these humanitarian concerns directly. A £100,000 grant by Ireland Aid to the international committee of the Red Cross was agreed last month, to address the rehabilitation of health facilities in Iraq, as well as water and sanitation facilities.</P>

My Department is represented on an advisory group which is assisting with the development of the plan. I am informed that the strategy being adopted by the consultants accords, in principle, with my position on the development of major public transport projects. I believe that such projects are best considered when they are developed in line with appropriate land use planning policy and practice so that the appropriate scale of project is put in place to justify the capital and ongoing operating costs.</P>

      <P>I understand that the potential for opening new railway stations, including one at Dunleer, was examined as part of the Dublin Suburban Rail Strategic Review, March 2000 commissioned by CIE and undertaken by Ove Arup consulting engineers. I am informed that the report notes that while Dunleer has potential for growth, the report indicates that the forecasted daily railway boardings for Dunleer would be modest. Nevertheless, I understand that the report recommends that the case for a new station at Dunleer should be kept under review, principally in the light of land use developments which might boost potential demand.</P>
      <P>I am advised that Bus Éireann is currently operating a high quality, high frequency service linking Dundalk, Dunleer, Drogheda and Dublin. I understand that there are 17 departures a day between Dunleer and Dundalk and between Dunleer, Drogheda and Dublin providing connections to locations such as Dundalk Institute of Technology, Drogheda, Dublin Airport and Dublin city centre.</P>

      <P>The DART fleet has comprised 80 carriages since services commenced in 1984. Ten new carriages were recently delivered, four of these units are in service since October, a further four entered service last week, and the remaining two will be available for use by the end of year.</P>
      <P>A further 16 carriages have also been delivered recently and will enter service in the spring of next year following commissioning. Twelve more carriages have been ordered and are due for delivery late next year and early in 2002.</P>
      <P>As these carriages come into service, capacity will increase. The following is indicative of the anticipated increases in carrying capacity of the DART:</P>

    <P>Capacity on the suburban rail network did not increase substantially until this year when 20 diesel railcars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann. These carriages are undergoing commissioning at present and are expected to enter service from January 2001 and will increase capacity by 2,500 places.</P>
    <P>The passenger carrying capacity of BAC increased by 7,235 from 67,150 places in 1997 to 74,385 places in 1999. Passenger journeys for the same period increased by 5,023 passengers, from 188,000 in 1997 to 193,023 in 1999. For the current year, it is projected that 125 additional buses will have been added to the fleet carrying approximately 10,770 more passengers than in 1999.</P>
    <P>The road fleet of Bus Éireann increased by 19 buses, from 611 buses in 1997 to 630 buses in 1999. The passenger carrying capacity increased by 1,007 places. The frequency of service on many routes also increased.</P>
    <P>The company also used around 190 private sector contractors per week in 1999; this increased passenger carrying capacity by a further 1,325 places.</P>
    <P>For the current year, an additional 59 new buses have been added to the fleet, with an additional passenger carrying capacity of 2,711 places more than in 1999. The frequency of service has once again increased in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national transmission grid will require very significant investment to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and liberalised market over the coming years.</P>
      <P>Economic growth over recent years has been reflected in high levels of growth in demand for electricity by all sectors of the economy, averaging around 6% per annum in recent years.</P>
      <P>This growth in demand continues to be managed competently by ESB. The categoric assurance which I have received from the chairman of ESB about the adequacy of the power supply situation this coming winter remains valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, I am pleased to say that I officially opened the new 120MW peat fired power station in Edenderry on Monday this week. This new <Col N="186" /> plant, which is almost six months ahead of schedule, will also help the electricity supply situation.</P>
    <P>The electricity system, including the national grid, is currently trying to cope with the demands being placed upon it by a larger and fast growing economy as well as the demands imposed by increased market participation resulting from the opening of the electricity market to competition.</P>
    <P>There is now a developing need to accelerate the level of capital investment in order to ensure the on-going provision of a modern state of the art infrastructure, both in the high voltage transmission network and also in the low voltage distribution network. Sustained load growth, especially over the past decade, has out-paced additions to the network.</P>
    <P>ESB is being encouraged by my Department to increase and accelerate its ongoing network investment programme. It is time to catch-up on past underspend on the network and also invest further expenditure on upgrading the system to meet the demand in growth.</P>
    <P>ESB is currently preparing its capital expenditure proposals for next year and it is expected that the bulk of the investment proposals will be targeted at the networks. ESB projects that its capital expenditure on the networks over the next five years will be around £2 billion.</P>

      <P>There are three sectors under the aegis of my Department that will benefit from EU funding in the context of the National Development Plan, 2000-06. The sectors in question are public transport, energy and communications-electronic commerce. No EU moneys have been spent in these sectors to date in 2000, as formal approval by the European Commission of the operational programmes embracing these sectors is still awaited in the case of a national operational programme and has only been recently received in the case of the two regional operational programmes.</P>
      <P>In the case of public transport, approval of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme is awaited from the EU commission. Approval by the EU commission is also awaited in relation to an application for cohesion fund assistance in respect of phase 1 of the Heuston terminal and south-west rail corridor development project. I understand that approval of both is imminent. As you are aware, no EU moneys may be spent pending approval by the commission of the operational programme and cohesion fund application; therefore, no EU moneys have been spent to date in 2000. The National Development Plan 2000-06 provides for ECU2.79 billion of investment towards public transport of which the EU will contribute ECU249 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Energy, no EU moneys have as yet been spent in 2000 pending approval by the EU Commission of the economic and social infra<Col N="189" /> structure operational programme. A provision of ECU185 million has been provided for energy in the current national development plan, with an EU contribution to the total investment of ECU43 million.</P>
    <P>In the case of communications-electronic commerce, no EU moneys have as yet been spent in 2000. The European Commission approved the operational programmes for the BMW and the S&amp;E regions only on 27 November 2000. A provision of ECU90 million of EU funding is to be provided for communications-electronic Commerce under these two operational programmes. This EU funding is expected to generate a total expenditure of over ECU500 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out to the Deputy that details of the likely targets for spending in the different sectors for the remaining years of the national development plan will be set out in the operational programmes when they are published.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the invitation to air carriers to tender for the Kerry-Dublin PSO route and for the other five PSO routes was published in the EU Official Journal on 16 September 2000. The closing date for submission of tenders was 17 October 2000. In all, four airlines, Aer Arann, Aer Lingus, Loganair and Irish Air Transport, submitted tenders covering the six PSO routes and in accordance with EU Regulation 2408/92, copies of the tenders have been sent to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>As this is a formal public tendering procedure conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU regulation, the Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to involve myself in any way in the process. The public tender competition was open to all interested air carriers on a fair and equal basis. A period of two months must elapse after the deadline for submission of tenders before any selection is confirmed. Our aim is to secure the completion of all necessary procedures in time to ensure continuity of services on the Kerry PSO route when the current contract expires in mid-January 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's BSE controls are among the strictest in the world having been significantly enhanced in line with scientific advances. These measures, many of which were introduced by my Department in advance of any EU requirement to do so, include: a legal obligation on veterinary surgeons, farmers and all persons in charge of bovines to notify this Department of any animal infected with BSE or suspected of being so infected; the destruction of carcasses of affected animals under official supervision thereby ensuring their exclusion from the human food chain; the depopulation of entire herds in which BSE has occurred. The carcasses in question are destroyed and farmers involved are compensated at full market value paid by the State. Progeny and birth cohorts of affected animals are also traced and destroyed; and the production, sale, possession, distribution and use of meat and bone meal, MBM, for any purpose is controlled by law and licences are required for any such activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the following controls apply: specified risk materials &ndash; SRM &ndash; are removed from all slaughtered and fallen animals, are rendered separately and incinerated; the remaining animal waste &ndash; animal waste free from SRM &ndash; is rendered in plants operating for 20 minutes at <Col N="193" /> 133º centigrade at 3 atmospheres of pressure in compliance with EU rules. This system has been validated and audited by successive EU Commission and FVO missions; and MBM can only be fed to non-ruminant animals. In order to prevent cross contamination at feed preparation stage. Feed mills which use MBM for inclusion in non-ruminant rations may not manufacture any ruminant feeds feed mills which manufacture ruminant rations may not have on their premises any MBM whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Last July, as an additional measure of consumer protection, I introduced an active surveillance programme to test certain categories of animals for BSE using one of the EU validated rapid tests. At the Agriculture Council last week, I strongly supported EU measures to improve rapid testing, in particular the testing from July 2001 of all cattle intended for slaughter aged over 30 months. I have already confirmed my Department's intention to proceed with this particular measure as soon as practical arrangements are in place and ahead of any EU requirement to do so.</P>
    <P>These control measures are tightly audited by my Department, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the European Union to ensure compliance. As a direct result of these measures, the European Union's scientific steering committee's geographically based risk assessment classified Ireland as very stable in 1997 and optimally stable, the highest level of stability that is achievable, since 1998, reflecting the effectiveness of the controls Ireland has put in place. Optimally stable means that all three main stability factors &ndash; feeding, rendering and SRM removal &ndash; are in place, well controlled, implemented and audited. Very few countries have achieved this high level of stability. I should add that, under OIE international standards, Ireland continues to be a country with a low sporadic incidence of BSE.</P>
    <P>All of the above controls, along with the status afforded to Ireland by the international bodies means that the maximum guarantees possible can be given to consumers of Irish beef. The net effect of the BSE control measures in Ireland is that cattle do not come from herds in which BSE has been confirmed; cattle have been subject to veterinary ante-mortem inspection prior to slaughter and certified as healthy and fit for slaughter for human consumption cattle have been subject to 100% veterinary post-mortem inspection after slaughter and have been certified as healthy, disease free and fit for human consumption; all SRM, including the brain, spinal cord, thymus, tonsils and ileum is removed and segregated during the preparation of the carcass; and all visible nervous and lymphatic tissues are removed during deboning and cutting.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all of the measures I have outlined, along with the status afforded to Ireland by the international bodies means that the maximum guarantees possible can be given to consumers of Irish beef. The question of additional measures at EU level is under dis<Col N="194" /> cussion and will be discussed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers next week.</P>

      <P>The Valuation Bill, 2000, as published, provides for the exemption of &ldquo;any building or part of a building used exclusively as a community hall&rdquo;. A community hall is defined in the Bill as a hall or similar building, other than the premises of a club for the time being registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, which is not used primarily for profit or gain, and is occupied by a person who ordinarily uses it, or ordinarily permits it to be used, for purposes which involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally, and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.</P>
      <P>This provision is intended to ensure that only bona fide community centres and facilities can avail of an exemption from rates and is a continuation of the existing relief provided under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978. It is not intended to extend this exemption to community centres that fall outside the definition as provided.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the Kilkenny region is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has informed me that its speech and language therapy services are under staffed by 50%. Four therapists have left the services since <Col N="197" /> June 1999. New posts have also been created and it has not yet been possible to fill these with the result that there are currently a number of vacant posts. One new member of staff was recruited in October 2000 as a result of a college sponsorship programme.</P>
    <P>The board is continuing to pursue this avenue of recruitment. The board has expressed its regret that many categories of clients cannot access the desired level of service due to this situation, but has assured me that these difficulties are not the result of a lack of commitment to the filling of these posts.</P>
    <P>My Department, while acknowledging the various initiatives which have been and continue to be undertaken to recruit various categories of staff, has asked the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore all measures to ensure that as many children as possible have access to the therapy services. I am also working with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to increase the number of training places available for the various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With reference to the services for the individual concerned, I have forwarded your inquiry to the chief executive officer of the board and have asked him to reply directly to the Deputy. I have also asked him to let me know of any developments in this matter in relation to both this individual and the service to the school.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) (No. 2) Act, 1978, all sales of local authority houses, under the tenant purchase scheme, are on the basis of fee simple rather than on a leasehold arrangement which previously applied. It is a matter for the relevant local authority, which is responsible for the administration of the tenant purchase scheme, to <Col N="204" /> acquire the ground rent speedily to enable the sale in fee simple to proceed. However, I understand that in a minority of cases, legal difficulties can delay finalisation of the process, particularly where title proves hard to establish. Having said that, I would point out that pending finalisation of the sale, the purchase price quoted by the authority to the tenant is frozen.</P>

      <P>The determination of eligibility for the shared ownership scheme is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. It is, therefore, a matter for the authority to decide, in the light of the circumstances pertaining to each individual case, whether or not to assess non employment related income, such as maintenance payments, in determining an applicant's ability to meet loan and rent repayments. I believe local authorities should exercise their discretion and accept maintenance payments as income in circumstances where the authority considers it appropriate to do so. I would be reluctant to remove what is, I believe, appropriate local discretion from the local authorities by directing that maintenance payments should, in every case, be taken into account as income.</P>

      <P>The Town Renewal Act, 2000, made detailed provision for the operation of the town renewal scheme and in particular provided that county councils would exercise an independent pro-active role in relation to the selection of towns and the selection of sites and the preparation of the town renewal plans themselves. It is appropriate that county councils who are in the best position to engage in the type of cross-sectoral consultation with relevant local interests which is required under the scheme, carry out this role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> In doing so they were assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them. These set out the purposes and aims of the schemes, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. County councils were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
    <P>Town renewal proposals prepared and submitted by county councils were then subjected to detailed assessment by an expert advisory panel which I established. The membership of the panel comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation etc.</P>
    <P>The role of the expert advisory panel on town renewal set up by me was to assess the county councils proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by the county council. The panel were confined to considering the sites recommended by the county council by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>In the course of their examination of the plans, the panel sought clarification from county councils in relation to various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panel was accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The sites selected for designation by the county council, examined by the expert panels and subsequently approved for designation followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. Therefore, I do not consider that a review provision is necessary, feasible or practicable; my priority now is to ensure that the town renewal scheme is implemented effectively in order to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved.</P>

      <P>Smoke emissions of diesel engined cars are tested by measuring the opacity of the exhaust emissions. The test, which uses specialised emissions testing equipment, measures the amount of light that travels through the exhaust gases and thus gives an indication of the level of smoke being emitted. On the basis of regular supervision of the national car testing service, I am satisfied that the test is applied consistently.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides, that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. Statutory Instrument No. 137 of 1998 specifies the circumstances in which a person is, or is not, deemed to be available for and genuinely seeking employment. Comprehensive guidelines on the application of the availability and genuinely seeking work conditions for entitlement to unemployment payments are made available to deciding officers and these guidelines are designed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.</P>
      <P>In applying the legislation in any case, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of the range of labour market opportunities which exist in the present economic climate. Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. School wardens are expected to meet the same requirements as other claimants in that regard.</P>
      <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>The unemployment benefit scheme is not intended to cater for situations where people are in part-time work and are only available to work on a part-time basis. If, however, a person in part-time employment loses that employment and shows that he or she is available for and seeking but unable to obtain full-time work then there would be a entitlement to unemployment benefit for the full week.</P>
      <P>The employment of school wardens is a matter entirely for the relevant local authorities and I will bring the Deputy's concern to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Class S contributors are currently covered for old age contributory pension, payable from age 66, widow/er's contributory pension, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, orphan's contributory allowance and bereavement grants. These contributors are not covered for retirement pension which is payable from the age of 65. One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension is that a person must be retired from insurable employment or self-employment. The retirement condition ceases to apply from the age of 66.</P>
      <P>The majority of employees are covered by PRSI class A and are covered for all benefits and pensions, including retirement pension. The degree of cover available to class S contributors is reflected in the rate of contribution payable. Class S contributors pay social insurance contributions at a rate of 5% whereas the combined employee and employer rate applicable to class A contributors is either 13% or 16.5%, depending on the level of earnings.</P>
      <P>Any consideration of the extension of cover for retirement pension to class S contributors would have to have regard to the financial implications of such a move, the necessity to adjust class S contribution rates to reflect the increase in cover provided and the administrative implications of applying a retirement condition to the self-employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to the impact of inflation on people dependent on social welfare payments. Last December's budget provided for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66; a special increase of £5.90 a week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66. The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government took office, social welfare payments have been substantially increased in real terms. For example, social welfare pensioners aged 66 years and over have received total increases of between 23% and 27% compared <Col N="209" /> with an increase of 11.2% in the cost of living during the same period.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that for many social welfare recipients and their families, the overall rate of increase in payment this year will be ahead of the increase in the cost of living. Pensioners who received the £7 increases are well ahead of inflation. In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances were provided this year, ranging from 8% to 17%. The budget also provided for significant increases of between 22% and 23% in monthly child benefit payments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of our commitment to align the tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all of the increases were paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May. We have already announced that the increases will take place at the start of the tax year from April next. In addition, I recently announced that this alignment of tax and social welfare changes will be maintained when the tax year is changed to coincide with the calendar year in January 2002. Social welfare weekly rates will be increased from January in that year &ndash; a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office. This progressively earlier payment of increases has to be taken into account in assessing the real level of increases which have been provided by this Government over its period of office.</P>
    <P>The higher than expected inflation has, of course, had the effect of reducing the real value of this year's budget increases in social welfare payments. However, in the forthcoming budget the Government will be taking full account of the increased level of inflation in setting increases for 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for a fuel allowance a person must satisfy a number of conditions including a means test. To be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme the income of an applicant and his or her household must be below a certain limit, currently £30 per week in excess of the appropriate maximum Irish contributory pension/benefit rate. This means that a person may have a combined household income of up to £30 per week over the appropriate maximum <Col N="210" /> pension/benefit rate, or savings of £30,000 and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>The income limit was increased from £15 per week, or savings/investments of £8,000, to the current level at the beginning of the 1999-2000 fuel season.</P>
    <P>Any further changes to the means test of the national fuel scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context and, as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Full arrears are payable on foot of late claims for the old age contributory pension, retirement pension and widow(er)'s contributory pension in the case of claims which are not more than 12 months late. Additional arrears are payable on a proportional basis in the case of claims which are delayed beyond 12 months. Further payment of pension may be made, up to the level of full retrospection, where the delay was due to incorrect information given by the Department, where illness or a <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier or where the person is suffering current financial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements apply to contributory pension claims made on or after 1 January 1997. In addition I obtained Government approval for once-off payments to contributory pensioners who made late claims prior to 1997. Arrears totalling £9.4 million have been paid to some 5,700 such pensioners who made late claims prior to 1997. The payment of full arrears to all late pension claimants would give rise to a once-off cost estimated at £54 million. In addition, there would <Col N="211" /> be on-going annual cost of £3 million. Separate costings of the amount of arrears in respect of the years 1995 to 2000 cannot be readily derived but an indicative figure would be £20 million.</P>
    <P>I believe that the arrangement which I have made since coming into office in relation to the late claims issue represent a reasonable and fair response to this problem.</P>

      <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda conciliation council, agreement was reached in March 1994, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force who retired after 1 January 1993. The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause &ndash; clause 3 &ndash; of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The agreement does not allow for retrospection.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, the Government decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3% in their pensions, or 2% in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1%.</P>
      <P>The Government has considered the issue of pension increases for public servants on several occasions since coming into office and, in order to help in its deliberations, referred the matter to the commission on public service pensions.</P>
      <P>The report of the commission on public service pensions is expected to be published shortly. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that following Government consideration of the report, a working group of the public service unions, relevant Departments and other appropriate parties will be established to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decision with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pension arrangements.  </P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to a project which applied for capital grant funding under an initiative designed for self-employed child care providers in my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. The programme has been allocated £250 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, for a range of initiatives. The application was submitted for funding under an initiative which was designed to support small scale child care services, that is, those services catering for not more than 20 children at any one time.</P>
      <P>I understand that the application is currently under consideration by the equal opportunities child care programme appraisal committee which was established to assess each application received and to make recommendations in each case. The programme appraisal committee is chaired by my Department and is made up of representatives of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the BMW regional assembly; the S&amp;E regional assembly and Area Development Management Limited.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the programme appraisal committee expect to be in a position to make a recommendation in this case shortly. I will be in a position to consider this case on receipt of the appraisal committee's recommendations.</P>

The other areas are Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
      <P>Following an initial assessment of each area by the Garda authorities, a detailed request for tender document will be drawn up setting out the specifications for each system-area in order to allow a competitive tendering process in line with EU and public procurement guidelines to be held. The completed tenders must then be evaluated before contracts can be placed. It is anticipated, however, that the ten CCTV systems referred to will be installed in 2001-2002. A total of £12 million has been allocated to the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001.</P>

      <P>Recent judicial cases have highlighted the State's failure over many years to make adequate educational provision for some children with special needs. As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to remedy these deficiencies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have already announced a range of new measures to enhance the quality and range of special education services available to children with autism. The measures in question include a doubling of the level of special needs assistant support provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>
      <P>In the case of the special class catering for the children in question, the increase in the level of special needs assistant support will mean that the class, which is catering for five pupils, will have the support of three special needs assistants, in addition to the class teacher.</P>
      <P>My Department has also recently sanctioned home tuition hours to assist one of the pupils with a home based applied behaviour analysis programme and a second application for such support is currently being considered.</P>
      <P>The issue of teacher training was also raised in the submission to which the Deputy refers. In this connection I would point out that arrangements have been made through the special education unit at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and Birmingham university, for the delivery of specialist training for teachers of children with autism. Training for 25 such teachers will commence in January 2001 and my department is finalising arrangements for a further expansion of the training programme to include a greater number of teachers.</P>
      <P>The submission also made reference to the role of the applied behaviour analysis approach in the education of children with autism. The appropriateness of this model of response is one of the issues currently being considered by the task force on autism, which I recently established and which I have requested to report to me within three months.</P>
      <P>The absence of adequate therapeutic support services for the children in question was also raised in the submission. Responsibility for the delivery of such services rests with the health authorities. However, I have asked my Department to raise the concerns expressed with the relevant health authority with a view to ensuring that the required services are made available.</P>

It will also facilitate lifelong learning and promote access, transfer and progression for all learners including those who have special needs. An important feature of the work of the new authority will be to ensure the recognition of Irish qualifications internationally and of outside qualifications here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in primary schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in that Department regarding this issue. In general, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and secretarial services.</P>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school caretakers and secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employers' PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards caretaking and secretarial services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil &ndash;<Col N="219" /> £20 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; subject to a maximum of £20,000 &ndash; maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which caretaking and secretarial services are to be provided.</P>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, with effect from September of this year, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools are receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of caretaking and secretarial services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by <Col N="220" /> schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, with effect from September of this year, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. The school referred to by the Deputy is one of the schools which has benefited under this phase of the scheme.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>

      <P>I understand that the needs of the child in question have not previously been brought to my Department's attention. However, I have requested my Department's inspectorate to investigate as a matter of urgency the level of special support required by the child in question. On receipt of the inspector's report, my Department will be in contact with the school authorities regarding the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under present arrangements, each special class for pupils with autism caters for a maximum of six pupils. Each class is served by a teacher and a special needs assistant. The pupils are also supported by the relevant health authority which has <Col N="224" /> responsibility for providing any necessary therapeutic services.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a package of new measures to enhance the quality and range of special education services available to children with autism. These measures include a doubling of the current level of special needs assistant support provided to each special class catering for children with autism. They also include an extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of special facilities catering for children with autism.</P>
    <P>Each decision to establish a special class for children with autism has regard to the number of children assessed as requiring the service and their locations. While no class is required to cater for more than six children, classes can be established to cater for lesser numbers where the circumstances warrant such a response. The decision in each case has regard to the level of identified and anticipated need for such a facility in an area. In selecting locations for such classes, every effort is made to accommodate the wishes of the parents of the children involved. However, it is also necessary to have regard to the views of schools in the area and their willingness to accommodate such a class.</P>

      <P>The position is that the three families, referred to by the Deputy, reside 0.6 miles, 0.6 miles and 1.5 miles respectively from the nearest pick-up point for the school bus. Normally, this is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>In this case, however, concerns were raised regarding safety issues and a report was requested from the transport liaison officer in the matter. The Deputy will be informed of the outcome as soon as the report is received and assessed.</P>

She submitted an application for grant assistance to County Cork VEC, under the terms of the scheme applicable to such a course, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, 2000.</P>
      <P>This scheme has a clause to the effect that candidates are ineligible for grant assistance if they already hold a degree. Accordingly, the student in question is not eligible for grant assistance under the terms of the scheme as she already holds a degree.</P>

      <P>The new programme will be based on the results of a recent survey that was conducted by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department. Schools with the highest levels of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving will be allocated resources that reflect the levels of concentration and the relative needs of pupils at risk. The school in question may benefit under this programme.</P>

      <P>The industrial dispute referred to concerns of administrative managerial grades and affects the institutes of technology generally with the exception of the Dublin Institute of Technology. Every effort is being made to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible. An offer based on the recommendations of independent consultants has been made. The matter has also been discussed at the Labour Relations Commission on a number of occasions. The Department is anxious that, as agreement has not been reached, the matter should now be referred to the Labour Court in accordance with good industrial relations practice. To date, one of the two trade unions involved has not agreed to such a referral.</P>
