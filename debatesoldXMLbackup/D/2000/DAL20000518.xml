      <P>In the context of promised legislation concerning the registration of medical practitioners and the nursing and health professions, which is on the Government's list, will the Minister ensure provisions are made to deal with the scandalous circumstances where people from Longford and Westmeath are unable to obtain cataract operations on the health service without the intervention of the Lions Club which, independently from the health service, is providing them with transport to Dublin on a charitable basis? Does the Minister agree that those in Longford and Westmeath who are blind because of cataracts should not have to rely on a voluntary organisation? The public health service should treat their cataract problems without outside intervention. Perhaps the idea of a public health service does not apply.</P>

Am I correct in understanding that the Labour Party Private Members' Bill was not, in effect, postponed last night, that a vote was taken on Second Stage, the Bill passed Second Stage but it will not be eligible to go into Committee until 1 <Col N="775" /> December and, therefore, there will not be another vote on Second Stage?</P>

    <P>Bill entitled an Act to provide, having regard to the need to secure an increase in the amount of electricity capable of being generated in the State and the limited amount of capacity in the natural gas network that is available for that purpose, for the allocation to persons by the Commission for Electricity Regulation of the use of a certain amount of that capacity for the purposes of supplying natural gas in connection with such generation, to enlarge the powers of Bord Gáis Éireann under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 1998, to otherwise amend and extend those Acts, to amend the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, in certain respects and to provide for related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Gas (Amendment) Bill, 2000, deals with four different issues. It provides for a scheme which will be implemented on an independent basis by the commission for electricity regulation to allocate scarce capacity in the natural gas network to prospective power producers to ensure that the electricity requirements of the State in the coming years can be met; it provides for the enlargement of the functions of Bord Gáis Éireann to allow it to engage in non-gas related activities; it provides for an amendment to the existing Gas Acts to increase the borrowing powers of BGE from £350 million to £550 million; and it provides for amendments to the Gas Acts, as amended, to introduce the same consent requirements for all people wishing to build natural gas pipelines. In this respect it will give private pipeline developers the same powers to access and compulsorily purchase rights over land as those currently enjoyed by BGE for the purpose of building pipelines.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the detailed provisions of the Bill, I will give the House a brief account of recent developments of the natural gas industry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until now the natural gas industry has been synonymous with BGE. The industry is relatively young. Prior to the discovery of natural gas in the Kinsale Head field off the south coast in the early 1970s, a number of gas companies existed in a small number of towns and cities around the State. Natural gas, however, was not very important in overall terms in meeting Ireland's energy requirements. Since its establishment in 1976, BGE has achieved significant progress in developing the natural gas industry in Ireland. It <Col N="779" /> now supplies natural gas to more than 300,000 homes and has more than 10,000 industrial and commercial customers. At the end of 1998, natural gas was meeting 23% of our total primary energy requirements. BGE now operates in a highly competitive energy market and must fight for market share against other fuels such as oil and electricity.</P>
    <P>Natural gas has played an increasingly important role in electricity generation in recent years. Last year more than 30% of electricity generating capacity in the State was fuelled by natural gas. This reflects trends at European level and even globally. Natural gas is now the fuel of choice for power generation. The development of combined-cycle gas technology has contributed significantly to increases in efficiency in power generation. In addition, natural gas has considerable environmental advantages compared to other fossil fuels. Gas combustion emits less CO2 than oil or solid fuels and, therefore, has an important contribution to make in helping Ireland and other countries to meet international obligations in relation to climate change mitigation.</P>
    <P>The natural gas industry is undergoing a significant period of change at present, not only at national level but at European level. The EU gas directive was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in 1998. This followed the adoption in 1996 of the EU electricity directive. The gas directive provides for the introduction of competition into the industry in the form of third party access to natural gas networks throughout the EU. The directive requires gas market opening to be introduced on a phased basis over ten years. However, already we are seeing evidence of a greater urgency about the pace of market opening. The European Council, at its summit in Lisbon, asked the EU Commission to bring forward proposals for full opening of the energy markets by 2004. The Council will review progress at its summit next spring.</P>
    <P>Ireland is already in compliance with, and greatly exceeds, the market opening requirements of the EU directive. The Energy (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1995, provided a legal framework for third party access by large gas consumers to the BGE network. Under this Act, customers consuming in excess of nine million therms of natural gas per annum at a single site may now buy their gas from suppliers other than BGE and have it transported through BGE's network on their behalf to their premises. This means that more than 75% of Ireland's market is opened. A number of large companies are currently sourcing some of their gas from outside the State and importing it through the interconnector.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Act also provides for the giving of ministerial directives to BGE relating to the transmission and pricing aspects of third party access. I issued two directives dealing with transmission and pricing in draft form in 1998 for pub<Col N="780" /> lic comment. On the basis of the responses received to that public consultation and of significant developments in the market, including the possible commercial development of gas off the west coast and interest by private developers in building gas pipelines, I decided last year that a fundamental review of pricing for third party access to the BGE network should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>This review is well under way and in the past year a significant level of consultation has been carried out with all interested parties. In order to obtain an independent view of suitable tariff options, I engaged economic consultants, the Brattle Group, to examine all the inputs from the public consultation and to propose a suitable tariff structure for the Irish gas network. My aim is to have a tariff that will promote the development of competition in the supply of natural gas, including the development of new indigenous sources of supply, and provide appropriate economic signals in relation to the establishment of new pipeline infrastructure. The Brattle Group in turn consulted all interested parties and presented its interim findings at a public forum last month. The consultants are due to present their final report to my Department shortly. I expect to be in a position to make a final decision on this issue very soon.</P>
    <P>As I outlined earlier, there are four issues being dealt with in the Bill. The main issue, providing for a scheme to allocate scarce capacity in the natural gas network, is a very pressing matter and I would like to outline to the House the background to this issue.</P>
    <P>At present, existing indigenous reserves of natural gas in Kinsale are declining. The interconnector with Scotland is nearing full capacity ten years sooner than had been anticipated due to faster than expected growth in demand. This growth in demand, which is a function of our economic success, is being boosted by the opening of the electricity market. It is too soon at this stage to know which of the possible options for new gas supply infrastructure will come to fruition. I will return to these options.</P>
    <P>This is a highly dynamic and intricate set of circumstances, which I would like to explain in more detail to the House. Our existing indigenous reserves of natural gas in the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields are declining and are expected to be depleted in four to six years depending on the rate of depletion. In 1999 up to 70% of our natural gas requirements were imported through the Scotland-Ireland interconnector. Against this background, my Department and BGE commenced a major study in 1997 on future natural gas infrastructural requirements. This study, the Gas 2025 study, was completed last year and, with a number of other reports on the gas sector, is available on my Department's website. It made a number of recommendations regarding future gas supply options and considered that the optimal solution would be to construct a second natural <Col N="781" /> gas interconnector with the UK parallel to the existing interconnector with Scotland.</P>
    <P>My Department then commissioned DKM Economic Consultants to undertake an economic assessment of the future gas supply options recommended by the Gas 2025 study. The DKM report recommended that we wait and see the outcome of the exploration of the Corrib gas field off the west coast before deciding on future gas supply infrastructure. On the basis of studies carried by my Department and BGE on forecasts of final demand for natural gas, it is expected that the capacity in the natural gas network will be sufficient to meet final demand until 2004, although larger than expected increases in demand would reduce this period. I understand that the position regarding the development of the Corrib field will be more clear later this year and that the Corrib partners, Enterprise Oil, Statoil and Marathon, will then make a decision on whether to proceed with the commercial development of the field.</P>
    <P>There are also other parties interested in building gas supply pipes, one from Belfast and one from the west coast of Britain. I will revert to the issue of pipeline construction later when I deal with amendments in the Bill to ensure compliance with the non-discrimination requirements of the EU directive in relation to the construction of pipelines.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons, there is for the time being some uncertainty about who will build the additional infrastructure needed to meet the supply requirements of the Irish market. In any event, if one or other of the private developers is not committed to building the necessary infrastructure by the end of the year at the very latest, I will approve the building of a second interconnector by BGE. This will allow sufficient time for new supply infrastructure to be in place to meet anticipated demand.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with developments in the newly opened electricity market which are impacting on the gas market. In anticipation of the opening of the electricity market to competition in February this year, a number of companies wishing to enter the market approached BGE last year to book capacity in the network to carry gas to fuel their proposed power plants. The applications for capacity received by BGE exceed, to a significant extent, the capacity that will be available in the network in the medium term.</P>
    <P>In addition, studies on electricity generation capacity requirements to 2006, carried out by the ESB in March this year at the request of the Commission for Electricity Regulation, indicate that, on the basis of forecasts for future electricity demand, an increase in power production capacity of 600 megawatts will be necessary by winter 2004. In order to ensure that the electricity needs of the State can be met over the next few years, I decided that available capacity in the natural gas network would be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling up to 800 megawatts of new gas fired power stations. While this <Col N="782" /> will meet the electricity needs of the country, it is insufficient to satisfy the demands of all the prospective power producers who applied to BGE for network capacity. Consequently, I decided that a scheme for the advance selection of power producers to whom network capacity would be allocated was necessary and that the allocation scheme should have particular regard to the need to ensure that new power plants were commissioned as soon as possible. Having regard to the provisions of the EU gas and electricity directives, the Attorney General advised that any allocation scheme devised should be put on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify why it is necessary for gas capacity to be allocated now rather than when new capacity becomes available for purchasing. Certainty about gas capacity is necessary in order for large-scale power projects to commit investment. There is a 24 month lead-in time from the commitment of investment to the production of electricity. This means that a delay in the allocation of gas capacity until there is certainty about new supply infrastructure could lead to electricity problems in about two years' time. My Department has consulted widely with interested parties on the process to be employed in allocating capacity to prospective power producers. A discussion paper was issued by my Department in October 1999 and the options considered in that paper for allocating capacity included: an auction, a lottery, an allocation process based on an ex-ante evaluation of &ldquo;first-to-market&rdquo;, and process based on an ex-ante evaluation of electricity price competitiveness.</P>
    <P>An overall consensus did not emerge from the public consultation but the most popular option was a process based on a &ldquo;first-to-market&rdquo; principle. I decided that the best interests of electricity consumers would be served by allocating capacity on this basis and my Department published a policy statement to this effect in December 1999. Both the discussion paper and the policy paper are available on my Department's website.</P>
    <P>A further issue which I also considered was the question of who would be responsible for conducting the allocation scheme. BGE normally allocates capacity as part of its transportation business. However, as BGE has declared its intention of entering the electricity market, it obviously would not be desirable to have a situation where it would be responsible for allocating capacity to potential competitors. To prevent any possible suggestion of discrimination, I decided that responsibility for allocating capacity to prospective power producers should be taken out of BGE's hands. I am not suggesting BGE would have behaved improperly in allocating the capacity but the potential for conflict of interest arising and the need for transparency in the process were sufficient grounds for the allocation process to be conducted on an independent basis.</P>
    <P>I decided that the allocation scheme should be <Col N="783" /> conducted by the Commission for Electricity Regulation for a number of reasons. It is an independent body charged with promoting the development of competition in the electricity sector and protecting the interests of electricity consumers. The experience it has gained since its establishment will be valuable in the process of allocating capacity in the gas network because of the synergies that exist between the two industries.</P>
    <P>I will detail the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision where the relevant terms used in the Bill are defined. Sections 2 to 16 are the relevant sections relating to the capacity allocation scheme and the conduct of that scheme by the Commission for Electricity Regulation. Section 2 empowers the Minister, after consultation with the Commission for Electricity Regulation, to make regulations authorising the commission to allocate a specific amount of natural gas capacity in any one year, to the power producers who will be selected by the commission under the scheme provided for in the Bill and any regulations made under the Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 5 set out the details of the procedure to be provided for in regulations which will be employed by the commission to select power producers to whom capacity will be made available. Essentially this procedure entails the power producers making an application for capacity in the network. The commission will then rank these applications, in order of precedence, on the basis of the estimated commissioning dates for the proposed power plants. The commission may make alterations in the ranking of applications to preclude the selection of an applicant where, in the opinion of the commission, the selection of that applicant would adversely affect the promotion of competition in the electricity market. If a power producer is selected and then forfeits its rights, the commission may then assign these rights to the power producer or producers ranked next in order of precedence. Alternatively, the commission may decide to begin the selection procedure again.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the commission shall determine and publish the criteria to which it proposes to have regard in deciding the date on which it estimates a proposed power station will be commissioned. These criteria must be published by the commission at least one month before the selection is made.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives the commission the power to require BGE or the ESB to provide certain information to it for the purpose of selecting power producers to whom capacity will be made available or for the performance of any of its functions. This section also obliges BGE and the ESB to comply with any request for information made by the commission within a time frame specified by it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables the commission to give directions to BGE regarding the use and management of the natural gas network, where it considers <Col N="784" /> that it is necessary to do so to ensure that the capacity rights of the power producers who are selected under this scheme are protected.</P>
    <P>Section 9 prohibits BGE from entering into contracts with any power producer, other than those who are selected under this scheme, before 30 September 2004 unless they are renewing an existing contract. The section also empowers the Minister to make an order repealing this prohibition on BGE entering into contracts with other power producers if the Minister is of the opinion that there has been, or is expected to be, an increase in the total capacity of the natural gas network.</P>
    <P>Section 10 imposes an obligation on BGE to make capacity in the natural gas network available to the power producers selected by the commission under the scheme provided for in the Bill when enacted or under regulations. The section sets out in detail the procedures to be followed in the contractual negotiations between BGE and the selected power producers and the time limits to apply to each part of the process. It also contains a dispute settlement mechanism and allows the commission to alter the time limits if it deems it proper and specifies the new time limit in writing. The section also sets out certain terms and conditions, both statutory and non-statutory, that may be included in the contracts between BGE and the selected power producers. The section does not preclude BGE from rescinding contracts in specific circumstances and, where the power producers forfeit their rights to the capacity it obliges BGE to terminate the contract.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that regulations to be made under the Bill, when enacted, may include provisions for bonds and levies. A requirement may be imposed on the power producers selected by the commission to effect a bond providing for the payment to the Minister of a specific amount which is calculated on the basis of the generating capacity of their proposed power plant if the plant is not capable of sending out electricity to the transmission or distribution system on its estimated commissioning date.</P>
    <P>Regulations may also provide for the imposition of a levy on selected power producers to defray the costs incurred by the commission in carrying out the selection procedure and to recoup funds expended by the Minister to facilitate the commission in preparing to carry out its functions under this Bill or the regulations. Regulations may include incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 contain amendments to sections 11 and 12 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. This will provide for the appointment by the commission of authorised officers to assist it in carrying out the selection process provided for in this Bill and for the obtaining of search warrants where it considers it necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 13 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information <Col N="785" /> obtained by the Commission in the performance of its functions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 contains an amendment of section 32 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The effect of section 15 is that any decision made by the commission under this Bill when enacted or regulations made under this Bill can only be challenged by way of judicial review proceedings. It precludes any person from questioning the validity of such decisions save by way of judicial review initiated within two months of the date on which the decision to be reviewed is given. Provision is made for the courts, in specified circumstances, to vary this time limit.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the indemnification of the commission by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas in relation to the performance of its functions under this Bill or regulations made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 relate specifically to BGE. Section 17 allows BGE, with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to engage in any business activity that it considers advantageous, whether or not it is related to the production, transmission or distribution of energy. This amplifies the existing functions of BGE which are limited to the energy sector.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the amendment of section 23 of the Gas Act, 1976, to increase the borrowing powers of the board from £350 million to £550 million. Sections 19 and 20 amend sections of the Gas Act, 1976, concerning access to and acquisition of land by BGE for the purpose of constructing and operating natural gas pipelines. BGE owns and operates the natural gas network. If it wishes to construct a pipeline, it must apply to me for consent to do so under the provisions of the Gas Act, 1976. There is no legislative prohibition on private developers building or operating a pipeline. The 1976 Act, as amended, requires that private developers give previous and reasonable notice to me of their intention to construct a pipeline, accompanied by an environmental impact statement, and I am permitted to require the pipeline to be constructed in accordance with certain environmental, safety and efficiency criteria.</P>
    <P>This means that, in effect, there are different legislative requirements for BGE and private developers wishing to build pipelines. This is contrary to the provisions of the EU gas directive. To date, no one other than BGE has constructed a pipeline. However, in the past year a number of private developers have informed me of proposals to build pipelines both within and to the State. The effect of section 19 is that everybody who wishes to construct a pipeline will have to obtain my consent. This consent may be subject to conditions I may impose in relation to the pipeline.</P>
    <P>The current legislative provisions governing the construction of pipelines place BGE in a more favourable position than private developers in that it has rights to access and acquire land for <Col N="786" /> this purpose. The EU gas directive, which entered into force in August 1998, prevents any form of discrimination between natural gas undertakings and requires that there be a level playing pitch for BGE and private developers.</P>
    <P>Section 20 extends the rights enjoyed by BGE regarding access to and acquisition of land to persons who have notified or have obtained the Minister's consent under section 40 of the Act. The enjoyment of these rights is extended subject to the same obligations to pay compensation that apply to BGE. The combined effect of sections 19 and 20 is to place private operators and BGE in the same position.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections contain provisions that are standard in legislation. Section 21 provides for the laying of regulations or orders under this Bill, when enacted, before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 22 provides that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance. Section 23 also contains standard provisions relating to the Short Title of the Bill and provision for collective citation etc. of the Acts amended by it.</P>
    <P>I and my Department have received a number of comments on the Bill from interested parties. I will take these into consideration and I envisage bringing forward some amendments on Committee Stage aimed at clarifying certain elements and enhancing the practical aspects of the Bill. I look forward to the contributions of Members and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity for a comprehensive debate on gas issues and proposals regarding the liberalisation of the electricity market on foot of the legislation that was enacted some months ago. I have some concerns about the Bill. I understand the need for it, but we are dealing with the optimum energy policy which will provide the highest level of efficiency and competitiveness nationally.</P>
      <P>The context of the Bill is that there is not enough gas. These issues have confronted us since 1997 and the Department has engaged in the process of analysis through the Gas 2025 study and various consultants. However, the issues remain the same. Although we are awaiting the results of the Corrib field explorations, there would be no need for the legislation if the Government had made a decision in relation to a second pipeline from Dublin to Belfast or a second interconnector between Ireland and Scotland because there would be enough gas. As IBEC pointed out to me, it takes as long to build a second pipeline as it does to build a power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be no need for the Bill, the primary aim of which is to allocate restricted gas capacity of the pipeline to power generators, if a decision had been made. The Minister said he intends to make a decision on the matter before the end of the year, but that decision should have been made in the past year. I urge the Minister <Col N="787" /> to bring forward the decision to increase capacity. The figures are clear &ndash; 31% of our natural gas is now used for electricity generation. All the new power generating stations want to use natural gas because it is the cheapest and most efficient generator of electricity and, in relation to our Kyoto commitments, it is also the most environmentally friendly. The position is that more gas is needed.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann says that the current capacity of ten million cubic metres per day will increase by October this year to 14.5 million cubic metres per day and to 17 million cubic metres by 2001. This falls short of what is required and hence the need to reserve 3.3 million cubic metres for 100 megawatts of electricity on the assumption that the pipeline will be available in 2004. However, my prediction and fear is that any beauty contest involving the selection of somebody to do this will be fraught with the potential for litigation. I have been advised that there is potential for litigation because the CER, Mr. Reeves, has proceeded with the process prior to the enactment of the legislation and he is acting <i>ultra vires</i>. This is one basis for legal challenge.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that this allocation of pipeline capacity is, under sections 4 and 5, in breach of the EU gas directive. People, including a large State company involved in the electricity business, are getting legal advice because, if they are denied right of access under the competition criteria, to which I will refer in more detail later, they will say that the legislation is defective because it is in breach of the EU gas directive.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court will make a judgment today on the decision of the ODTR to give the third mobile telephone licence to Meteor, an Irish-US consortium. There was supposed to be a third mobile telephone operator in position two years ago at the latest. However, that matter has been bogged down by a High Court challenge and a Supreme Court appeal, one by Orange and the other by the regulator. If this legislation follows a similar legal route, the Minister will not be giving pipeline capacity to anybody because the matter will be bogged down in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out the four options available to him in allocating the pipeline capacity &ndash; a lottery, an auction, an evaluation of efficiency based on price or an evaluation on first to market &ndash; and he has chosen the latter. However, the two beauty contest systems, efficiency and first to market, are predicated on promises which are only punishable by penalty and not by removal of the licence. This is ripe for litigation, and it will defeat the purpose of providing gas between now and 2004 if litigation takes two years.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that all such allocations by the State, for example, for the wireless local loop, the mobile telephone licence or gas capacity, should be by way of auction. It does not surprise me that only four of the respondents on the Minister's list favoured an auction because it diminishes their profits. If we consider past events and what is happening in the rest of Europe, it is <Col N="788" /> clear that licences and allocations by regulators are valuable pieces of paper. My point is that Denis O'Brien and ESAT made too much profit. The last Government decided on that licence, but more should have been paid for it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gordon Brown recently got a windfall of £22 billion from the latest generation of telephone communications licences. The advantage of an auction is that the unsuccessful bidder walks away rather than to the Four Courts. It brings clarity, conclusion and certainty to the process and avoids litigation. It could be a condition of an auction that the process is finite, as happened with Cablelink. The profits Esat made were too excessive. Whether it is the third mobile phone operator or a person who wishes to supply gas, they will charge as much as the market will absorb. An example of the outcome for the consumer is that we have the highest prices for mobile phone use in Europe because there is not a third mobile phone operator. It is in the best interests of the consumer to bring clarity and certainty into this area and to make expeditious decisions, and an auction is the best way to do that. It does not surprise me that companies are not lining up to minimise their profits given that the market will reflect a certain price for gas and electricity. Based on that dynamic, the issue should be confronted. The approach taken in sections 2 to 16 is wrong. Given the breach of the gas directive, I can see the ESB taking a case. A number of people have told me the CER is operating <i>ultra vires </i>and there are other detailed points concerning the way it will develop.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make decisions on the infrastructure of new pipeline capacity? Should it happen that the process becomes stuck in a legal quagmire, if the Minister of State has taken decisions on pipeline capacity, he will have resolved the problem, because a pipeline can be built as quickly as a power station. The Minister of State should bite the bullet. It does not matter whether it is Premier Transco or BGE. He should do it. The wait and see approach has resulted in the necessity for this legislation and it impedes the ability of the market for electricity and gas to develop in a normal commercial fashion.</P>
    <P>A specific point I would like the Minister of State to address relates to an outstanding issue from the Electricity Regulation Act. That legislation provided for a PSO levy to apply to people who buy electricity from new power providers. A number of people within that market have a co-generation proposal. In other words, they wish to generate heat for their own proposal and have a combined heat and power plant to produce electricity. The largest of these is Aughinish Alumina. I am told a decision will be made in the next few weeks on a statutory instrument regarding how the PSO levy will apply. Aughinish Alumina intends to build a plant generating 310 MW using gas. A fair compromise would be that people who generate up to 20 to 25 MW for their own purposes would be exempt from the PSO levy. A capacity of 20 to 25 MW is a bona fide CHP plant. <Col N="789" /> I will return to this because a CHP plant is not properly defined in the Bill. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider my suggestion, not as a special favour to Aughinish Alumina, but as a crucial development of the mid-west and employment in the region. Aughinish Alumina is unique in that the heat requirement for its manufacturing process requires a level of generation capacity sufficient to create enough heat seven days a week, 365 days a year. Building its own plant would give it huge savings and would guarantee employment in the mid-west. A threshold should be introduced for both for CHP and co-generation below which the PSO levy would not apply where the generator and user is the same person. That would protect the ESB's position and deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>What are the penalties for people who receive an authorisation or licence under the legislation on the basis of promising to be first to the market and who do not deliver? The manner in which this has rolled out appears to have resulted in 11 potential IPPs being reduced to three, and that is of great concern for the dynamics of the electricity market. If the legislation were to provide for three successful applicants to receive gas capacity and I were number four or five, I would have an incentive to go to court because those who won on the basis of being first to market would be delayed by my litigation, thus allowing me to get my environmental impact statement in place and obtain my planning permission to construct whatever was necessary. This is a built-in incentive. In that regard, what penalty will apply to those who fail to commission on time?</P>
    <P>As a member state we are obliged to implement the EU gas directive in August this year. It has been asked why the Department is not incorporating the directive in this legislation. Of greater concern is that we are told the gas directive legislation will not be ready until the middle of next year. People are concerned, and pipeline operators, explorers, people who may bring gas ashore and others would like the gas directive implemented in full. Perhaps the Minister of State would, in the context of Committee Stage, examine the possibility of including sections to deal with that. We have spoken of ten eligible customers in the liberalised gas market. Given that it is restrictive, we need to have answers to facilitate those ten eligible customers to move as quickly as possible. The Department has been slow in coming to an end position on that.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendments I will table on Committee Stage, I wish to be transparent by saying that I have had discussions with a number of interested parties. I am sure my colleagues have done likewise and it was referred to by the Minister of State. While the public tends to be bored by debates of this nature, they are important for the competitiveness of the economy. I have spoken with representatives of the ESB, BGE, Viridian, one of the first possible applicants to market, Premier Transco, which wishes to lay a <Col N="790" /> pipe, and Enterprise Oil and Corrib Oil, which are offshore exploration companies. In the interests of transparency, I will state which amendments they have requested me to table so the Minister of State understands people's motivation. My position, as with the complex and lengthy electricity legislation, is to understand what people seek and to consider it in the context of the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>We went through a detailed process regarding green issues when discussing the Electricity Regulation Act. All those who made submissions on the legislation, especially those involved in wind energy, have pointed out that, while we had a detailed debate on the legislation and were in favour of wind energy, the CER has issued a discussion paper which minimises the impact of what we tried to do to optimise the use of wind energy by giving it a preferential market, positive discrimination, and so on. I am not happy with the accountability of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, the CER or the new aviation regulator, and this point has also been made by Deputy Stagg. These regulators have been given powers of regulation by this House for good reasons of independence and EU requirements. The accountability of Mr. Reeves and the CER is defective and that is borne out by the fact that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has promised legislation for the ODTR and a commission to oversee the regulators. That grey area is not dealt with in the legislation. In other words, while we can enact this legislation, there are no corresponding measures to ensure the House or the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport has proper authority over the CER if it fails to implement what we agree. I would appreciate the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ESB's concerns, it believes sections 4 and 5 will, by their definition, exclude the proposal by Dublin Bay Power to obtain gas. The Ringsend proposal involves a 70% stake from the ESB and 30% from Statoil to construct a station to generate 390 megawatts of electricity generation based on a gas facility. That has been the plan for some time and there has been much debate on it. They believe the competition criteria set out in section 4(<i>b</i>) &ndash; pages 11 to 12 &ndash; particularly line 3, which states that the commission shall make such alteration in the ranking of the person in that order of precedence as it considers will prevent such a result. This is in the context of competition criteria. The ESB would rather not have that &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but it should at least be &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I would like the Attorney General's advice on this point, as the ESB has the resources to go 12 rounds in court with the CER on this matter. We will be left with a pipeline and nobody to whom to give the 3.3 million cubic metres.</P>
    <P>The ESB makes some specific points based on its senior counsel's advice &ndash; that the legislation, particularly sections 4 and 5, is in breach of Article 18 of Gas Directive 98/30/EC, that it contradicts the terms of reference of the CER as it <Col N="791" /> was established under the Electricity Generation Act and that it is contrary to the section of that legislation which states that the CER should not discriminate against any power generator, which is what is happening here. The important point is that this legislation gives out a section of the pipeline but not a gas contract. The ESB points out that its contract with Alliance Gas Limited, which is a subsidiary of Statoil, would be open to legal challenge and Articles 3, 7 and 17 of the gas directive are breached.</P>
    <P>If I were in the Minister of State's position, I would consider this heavyweight stuff as legal teams will make a lot of money out of thrashing this out. It might be in the ESB's interests to say, &ldquo;By God, if Dublin Bay Power is not going to get the gas to compete we will make sure nobody else gets it.&rdquo;  That would suit it just fine except for one thing, we have had eight amber alerts in electricity generation in peak day demand and winter shortages. My fear for the consumer is that we will face the prospect of power cuts next winter or the winter after because of the failure to resolve this issue and to commission new plants. We have been stuck in or around the 4,000 megawatt capacity for some time and we need to get on our bikes, as the forecasts for growth in megawatt requirement and generating capacity have been exceeded because of the Celtic tiger. This issue cannot, therefore, be bogged down in the courts. I am not saying we should just roll over and follow the ESB, I have consistently stated that I am for competition. However, if the ESB is right in its legal arguments it cannot be dismissed and the electricity market proposals may unravel.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Oil sought legal advice from London on the Bill, pointing out that the section that defines commissioning is technically wrong because typically one sets up a contract and has a trial run of 30 days before commissioning a plant. Enterprise Oil states that commissioning is itself a process, typically over a six month period, in the course of which both plant and all related facilities are progressively tested, leading to a reliability run which is typically 30 days, only after which the handover of the plant from the EPC contractor to the owner takes place. Enterprise Oil believes that the Department has misunderstood the term &ldquo;commissioning&rdquo;, which is a very technical term, so I will be tabling an amendment in relation to this.</P>
    <P>A number of potential gas pipeline layers refer to the section of the Bill which deals with the bond. Those in the business, including Viridian, say they are knee-deep in bonds of every description and that the bond for the average power station under this legislation would be between £15 and £20 million. Whatever about a levy, they feel this situation is punitive and would be a disincentive. If 11 potential IPPs have been whittled down to three, I would take that argument seriously. A bond is only a bond in relation to <Col N="792" /> non-delivery &ndash; perhaps the issue could be dealt with by penalties.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Oil also refers to the code of operations in terms of the STA, which it believes should be reviewed with a view to modification. There is already a BGE code of operators and this is absent from the Bill. Perhaps it should be reflected in the Bill as Enterprise Oil feels it would streamline operation. I do not necessarily agree with Enterprise Oil on gas contracting, but in the case of the Corrib find going ahead and the gas coming onstream, under this legislation the gas contracts would be tied in between the IPP and Bord Gáis for four years. This would preclude the opportunity of anyone else entering that market in that period. Enterprise Oil feels a more flexible model should be looked at. One could argue that both ways, but the Minister of State should look at the IPP gas contracting system as it evolves.</P>
    <P>Premier Transco is an interesting company because it is the only non-BGE pipelayer at the moment. It requires technical clarification of section 19, which provides for a new consent procedure for someone laying a pipeline and particularly subsection (1) which refers to 27 April 2000, as it would have had correspondence with the Minister before that date. The new and old consent procedures are different and by virtue of Premier Transco's correspondence with the Minister before 27 April it wants to clarify that it is to be treated under the new procedure rather than the old procedure. Premier Transco has given me the wording of an amendment to the principal Gas Act, 1976, in that regard so that the new regime would apply. The company is not actually an applicant for a licence, but a letter could be construed as such.</P>
    <P>Premier Transco also points out that if BGE wishes to run a pipe to somewhere in the mid-west or north-west, it can simultaneously have the right to go on lands while carrying out the environmental impact assessment study, whereas under section 19(2) of the Bill, a new pipeline operator could only go onto land after the environmental impact assessment study is completed. Premier Transco is looking for a level pitch, that it can survey land and do a trial borehole, just as BGE can, so that one would not have a further year's delay &ndash; they could be done simultaneously. This should be looked at favourably.</P>
    <P>BGE and other bodies have made a very important point about the definition of &ldquo;power station&rdquo; under this legislation. There have been endless debates about CHP and its efficiency as well as other environmental benefits. It believes &ndash; I am referring to Bord Gáis Éireann &ndash; that it treats combined heat and power as power generation and says, therefore, that an interpretation of this legislation could prohibit all new CHP building until September 2004. This is probably unintentional and I do not believe it is desirable in view of the Government's greenhouse abatement strategy. Therefore, the definition of power station should be modified so as to exclude CHP, <Col N="793" /> which could be achieved by defining power stations as plants over 20 or 25 megawatts in size. This refers to my earlier point about creating that threshold for Aughinish Alumina, other co-generators and the PSO levy.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann also makes the point that section 9 places a severe restriction on new gas contracts which may be entered into by it. It suggests that section 9 be redrafted so that it can enter contracts provided the rights of new capacity holders are protected &ndash; on Committee Stage I will go into more detail on this. It also suggests that the provision of CPO powers to other parties should be dealt with in a new section and provided on a separate basis as it believes that a legal challenge to one CPO could tie up their CPOs.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann also believes that certain sections, such as section 8, should be redrafted. Section 8 provides very strong powers to the CER relating to the protection of the rights of holders of capacity under the allocation scheme. BGE says these are without balance in terms of other users of the gas system, even other generators. Therefore, it is suggested that the section be redrafted to acknowledge other user rights so that the situation pertaining to CER is balanced.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the proposals from Viridian, which is interesting in that it is not a potential IPP but, like Huntstown, is well down the road and likely to be well up in the pecking order. It makes a number of points and is anxious to see the legislation progress quickly as it has everything sorted out except the gas. Viridian is concerned about section 3 which does not seem to delineate between single cycle gas turbines and combined gas cycle turbines. It quotes the example of the ESB plant at Poolbeg which went in phases from gas burning, to a turbine, to gas and steam turbine generated electricity. It believes, therefore, that the commissioning definition in section 3 does not fully take account of this point. It points out that where the ranking is equal in section 4, the bigger power station will get the generating licence or capacity which it thinks is unfair. It believes that where the first power station has a capacity of 400 megawatts and the others have a capacity of 200 megawatts, it is better to go with the latter, and I think it is correct. Therefore, I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of deleting subsection (a) which gives preference to bigger power stations.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 9, Viridian makes the point about CHP being undefined. It is opposed to the bond in section 11. Regarding section 17 and other related provisions which give the Minister power in various aspects, perhaps an insertion should be included stating that CER has power to make recommendations to the Minister in advising him or her in relation to the consent procedures set out in the section. This also applies to section 19. It would be prudent to give some role to the regulator in this context.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be constructive and to acknowledge that there is a need to allocate gas capacity <Col N="794" /> given the current situation. We should examine the issue of infrastructure and accelerate a decision in this regard. Finally, auctions and tendering for all licences as a matter of policy will give better clarity and are a better way of progressing all these competitive issues in the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister's officials &ndash; Peter O'Neill and other members of staff &ndash; for briefing us prior to this debate. It was a very useful exercise and I thank the Minister for arranging it.</P>
      <P>A Bill to allocate the known scarce gas resources of the country should have been published and enacted two years ago. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was warned by the ESB of the danger of power cuts as early as 1997, while her departmental officials were aware of the impending crisis even earlier. The Minister was aware of the limited capacity to import natural gas and that the Marathon gas field was nearly depleted. Yet she refused permission to the ESB to build a power station in Ringsend and the new deity of competition was given as the reason. She also refused permission to Bord Gáis Éireann and is still refusing &ndash; this morning the Minister of State said he is only considering the matter &ndash; to build a second interconnector to import natural gas from the North Sea despite being repeatedly warned that the existing infrastructure and pipeline could not cope with demand.</P>
      <P>We are now facing an emergency where natural gas will have to be rationed and where power stations will not be supplied, with the certainty of power cuts in 2001 and 2002, with things becoming worse in 2003. The Minister must and will carry the can for this disaster. She knowingly failed to deal with the impending crisis and stands condemned for neglecting to carry out her critical ministerial duties.</P>
      <P>Directly arising from the Minister's failure or inability to heed the many warnings she received, including in the House, Ireland is now facing for the first time the real prospect of serious and prolonged power failures. These power cuts will seriously damage the industrial and commercial life of the country and adversely affect the quality of life of large numbers of citizens. When they occur &ndash; I believe they are inevitable &ndash; the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, should not try to lay the blame anywhere other than at her own door. She was warned by the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann and decided to ignore them both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister, even at this 12th hour, made two simple decisions, the crisis could be averted, but because of the right wing political straitjacket in which she operates, I doubt she is capable of doing so. Because of her deeply held right wing political ideology, even when facing the emergency I have described and given the clear public interest in ensuring a continuation of electricity supply to industry and the commercial sector, I doubt if she is prepared to do anything that might <Col N="795" /> offend her new god, namely, privatisation and so-called competition, which is worshipped daily.</P>
    <P>Neither is it acceptable for the Minister to hide behind the advice of the Attorney General. She, I and the House know that the advice from that quarter comes from a man who espouses a deeply held belief which is opposed to public enterprise in any form and who preaches a philosophy which favours the wealthy and the private individual and which is opposed to the rights of common people and the community. The Attorney General is an avowed Thatcherite and despite the fact that philosophy has been discredited throughout the world, it still has an ardent advocate in the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in the House a long time. Do I need to bring to her attention that the advice she is receiving from the Attorney General is not a true and balanced legal opinion but a political opinion masquerading as legal advice? As such, the Minister has every right to reject it, but I know she does not have the courage to do so. The coalition is gingerly held together and it would be impossible for the Minister to do anything which would threaten that shaky alliance. As a result, Michael McDowell can dictate policy to the Government and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the two simple things the Minister could do to avoid this looming crisis. She could give the necessary authority to the ESB to proceed with the building of its new gas turbine power station in Ringsend. The request for this authorisation has been on the Minister's desk almost as long as the warning notices about power cuts. The electricity directive and competition regulations clearly allow such action to be taken by member states where they face emergencies, such as Ireland faces in terms of electricity supply. Why then has the Minister not done so? I was directly involved in the negotiation of the electricity directive, which provides for such scenarios. The Government can make provision to meet demand where it cannot otherwise be met.</P>
    <P>The second direct action the Minister could take is to authorise the construction by BG of a second interconnector to Scotland to allow Ireland to tap into a sufficiency of natural gas from the North Sea. This could be in place and supplying gas by 2002 if a decision were made even now. However, it should have been made three years ago. The application is on the Minister's desk awaiting her attention and I appeal to the Minister of State to impress on his senior colleague that this action, which does not contravene any directive, should be taken so that ample gas will be available.</P>
    <P>There would be no need for this emergency legislation if the Minister were to take such action. Gas would be available for all competitors to build as many power stations as they wish and they would be able to live or die in the marketplace. I urge the Minister to act because if she delays beyond the end of this year it will be too late. The result will be power cuts. I have little <Col N="796" /> confidence that the Minister has the courage or political will to give authority to the ESB to proceed with the power station in Ringsend or to give BG the authorisation for the second interconnector, nor has she the bottle to reject the Thatcherite political advice of the AG.</P>
    <P>What do we get? We wait three years as the crisis mounts and the Minister ignores it, hoping it will go away. A Bill is then introduced to address the crisis caused by her prevarication and inability to make decisions. This legislation contains extraordinary right wing ideology. It reflects the thinking in the AG's office and the office of the regulator, Tom Reeves, but not that in the Department of Public Enterprise. It also indicates how weak willed the Minister is when dealing with these two gentlemen. The Minister does not have the courage to come into the House to present this right wing straitjacket for the public commercial sector. Instead, she sends in the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who is landed with steering the Bill through the House. I attach no blame to him but I fear he will not have the authority to accept changes to this legislation as it is processed.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the offending sections. The Bill has been introduced in a context where the legal adviser to the Government is ideologically opposed to all forms of public enterprise, the regulator mistakenly believes his remit is to curb the development of public enterprise and facilitate a soft landing for private sector vultures and the Minister's title should be changed to the Minister for undermining public enterprise.</P>
    <P>Section 4 restates, and unnecessarily re-emphasises, the role of the electricity regulator in the promotion of competition. That matter is adequately dealt with in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1998, and does not need to be restated. The regulator has re-interpreted the Act such that all its sections are considered subservient to the promotion of competition. For example, in his recent discussion paper he proposed a cap on the production and sale of green electricity despite explicit provisions in the Act which allow for free market entry of such electricity companies with no limit on production. He has taken on the role of policy maker, legislator and regulator and seemingly the Minister is afraid to tackle him.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is right down the regulator's street. If it is agreed, as drafted, he will be able to thumb his nose at the Minister and pay homage to his competition god with the backing of legislation. The section uses the definitive &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this regard rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;will consider&rdquo;. This will ensure the Minister will not be able to divert direct policy in the matter and that the possibility of a court challenge to the regulator's decision will be excluded. I presume that is why &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is included and the Attorney General and the regulator were directly involved in the drafting of the section. If it agreed, without amendment, the regulator will be a powerful and untouchable <Col N="797" /> man. I am sure he is rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect. I know him very well.</P>
    <P>If this were not enough the same competition god is again fortified in section 5. Who drafted this legislation? The section is not necessary because it is already covered in legislation. Is the regulator not satisfied that he has enough power already and that he will be able to stop the green electricity drive agreed by this House with the powers he has already? Why has it been included again?</P>
    <P>Section 4 also contains a major shift in policy from that in operation and agreed with the main players. It puts competition on such a high pedestal that it breaches a principal clause in the CCR agreement with the ESB management and unions and the Minister and her Department. It was agreed policy that competition would be introduced in the generation of electricity and that the ESB would be entitled to take part in that competition. The agreements, one of which is quite recent, between the Minister, the ESB and the unions state that the ESB would be entitled to take part in the competitions. A new policy that excludes the ESB from taking part is contained in this section. That is not acceptable and it will be fought in the House and outside it. This is a case of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</P>
    <P>In the time available before power cuts are a reality the only players who will be ready and capable of producing electricity will be the ESB, at its new power station at Ringsend, and Ireland Power in west County Dublin. My information regarding Viridian in Huntstown and its 600 megawatt power station is that it is not proceeding with it because the technology it proposed to use would not be efficient or competitive. It is going back to the drawing board to build a 400 megawatt power station which will use different technology. It is back at square one. Essentially, only two players can produce enough electricity in time to prevent power cuts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is the second player? The ESB is one, who is the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland Power. If this new anti-State enterprise policy is forced through it will lead to court challenges by the ESB's partner, Statoil, and its suppliers of gas, who are entitled to be included in the competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should also be aware that the unions in the ESB will not tolerate this abuse of their company and this breach of the CCR and the tripartite agreement. They will not tolerate their agreements with the Department being breached because a law is introduced which sets aside those agreements. It has been accepted both by management and unions that 40% of the ESB's generating capacity will be lost to the private sector due to the introduction of competition. This will occur because the majority of power stations are old and do not employ the most efficient tech<Col N="798" /> nology. For the future well-being of the ESB, therefore, it is imperative that the company should be allowed to compete by building modern power stations.</P>
    <P>During my time as a Minister of State in the Department we pursued a policy of not putting all our energy eggs in one basket. Now, however, we are heading for a system whereby the overwhelming majority of our power generation will be from one energy source &ndash; gas. That is a highly undesirable situation both from a strategic point of view and as regards energy security. The Minister, who I know is interested in energy systems other than gas, should examine that part of Government policy to see if some diversification can be assured in real terms. I do not mean tinkering around the edges with wave power. If diversification of supply was achieved we would not be left without energy in an emergency arising from the fact that we would produce practically all our electricity from imported gas supplies. That serious strategic consideration should be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Department should consider alternatives to gas, even if the Bill is enacted and there has to be an auction to ration the amount of gas we have left. As a safety measure the Minister should consider authorising Bord Gáis to build an interconnector so that the North-South interconnector can go ahead. The Minister should not hang around waiting for John McGoldrick and Enterprise Oil to play cat and mouse with the Government. The Minister should not wait until Mr. McGoldrick is able to dictate to the Government exactly what will happen. If we do not proceed with the interconnector he will effectively have a monopoly of supply for all the new demand. Since nobody else will be supplying it, he will be able to decide policy. By delaying the interconnector we are playing into Mr. McGoldrick's hands.</P>
    <P>I intended to raise particular points relating to sections but since Deputy Yates has already done so, I will not repeat them. We will deal with them in some detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable to introduce legislation that is promoting competition in such a way that some of the players in the market are excluded. It is extraordinary that we are excluding public companies, such as the ESB and Bord Gáis, when we do not need to. The ESB will be seriously damaged if this decision goes ahead. The company has expended a huge amount of money on foot of ministerial approval for the power station project, for which the generator has already been ordered. The ESB is simply awaiting clearance from the Minister for civil works. We could, therefore, have the farcical situation of the ESB having a new power station, but we would experience power cuts because we could not supply any gas to the plant at Ringsend. There is a real possibility that could occur.</P>
    <P>The other real danger is that we will have the worst of all worlds by making a decision to exclude the ESB from competition and as a result <Col N="799" /> there will be court action. In that case nobody will produce the electricity in time so we will have power cuts. We are facing into a dangerous scenario.</P>
    <P>I am a strong advocate of keeping power in this House because the people send us here to exercise power on their behalf. I feel strongly that such power should not be granted to quangos, whether individuals or groups, that have no democratic accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The office of the electricity regulator has a great deal of power. The Bill effectively takes the power the Minister exercises as the regulator of gas, and gives it to the powers the ESB regulator already has. That is undesirable from the point of view of democratic accountability and the exercise of power on behalf of the people. The Minister should examine that matter and find ways of making the regulator accountable.</P>
      <P>The system of rationing gas that the Department has come up with is the best one. While the Department would say that is the central issue in the Bill and the reason for the legislation, I disagree. Changes in competitive policy are more important than the rationing system for our remaining gas reserves. The &ldquo;first up, best dressed&rdquo; system is probably the best one. I am worried, however, about an auction system because the deepest pockets can pay the highest price in the knowledge that they can recover that cost from the end consumer.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister for having the job of bringing this ideological baggage into the House, which I am sure is not of his making. As it stands, the Bill is unacceptable to the Labour Party. On Committee Stage we will deal with the issues that have been raised and, I hope, we will be able to resolve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that through this Bill we are providing a scheme which will implement a commission for electricity regulation on an independent basis. Unlike the previous speaker, I do not sympathise with the Minister at all. I congratulate him, however, because during his period in office he has demonstrated a keen interest in energy matters. He has published a Green Paper on Sustainable Energy and has also examined alternatives to traditional electricity production methods. In addition, the Minister has examined renewable sources of electricity generation while maintaining the competitiveness which the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke has also mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has responsibility for energy matters and his continuing interest in this sector is a matter of record. The first concern I wish to raise with him relates to a seminar concerning the electricity grid in the west, which was held last Friday at Sligo Institute <Col N="800" /> of Technology. We do not have a generating station in the western region, nor do we have the same transmission network as elsewhere in the country. It is important for us to examine this matter. The ESB is currently exploring ways of improving the electricity service in County Galway, including the provision of new lines from Portumna to Athenry. As we know, many areas of the west, from Donegal to Kerry, are not on the national grid, and we have been reminded many times by people involved in wind energy that we have to improve our system. Resources are being put into roads, railways and the provision of ISDN lines for the western region but one of the areas that has been forgotten about is the whole question of energy. We have not seen much interest in setting up another electricity generating station in the region.</P>
    <P>I read in the ESB electric mail magazine that the go-ahead has been given for a power plant at Huntstown, north County Dublin. Approval has been given also for an e-power venture between Esat's Denis O'Brien and other Irish investors for a site outside Navan, County Meath, and two new peat-fired power stations are planned for the midlands. There is also a proposal for a biodiesel project which will be built in Ireland by a Dutch company called Petroplus International. That interesting concept involves producing a biodiesel using the seeds of plants like grape or olives which are treated in a chemical process, and the oil resulting from this is burned. That is regarded as a green electricity and is obviously very sound on environmental and health grounds. There is no indication, however, that there will be a similar type of station in the western region. At a time when there is much talk about the finds in the Corrib gas field, it is important that we put in place the necessary infrastructure before the gas field becomes operational.</P>
    <P>I was in contact with Bord Gáis Éireann who sent me a map of its future supply options. While they showed existing lines going from Cork to Dublin and the interconnector to Scotland, it states clearly that there is a possibility of a new pipeline, as it was described, from Dublin to Galway and down to Limerick. It does not indicate if the spur lines to individual towns will be shown, and they are not shown in any of the maps or correspondence I received, but Bord Gáis Éireann makes it clear that all these proposals are subject to ministerial approval. I join with the other speakers who called for the speeding up of the provision of supply options to the western region. The question of a second interconnector is also very necessary. We already have the interconnector to Scotland and there is another proposal to have a second connector approved and installed.</P>
    <P>Obviously what we are talking about here is a move towards environmental and health matters in relation to gas fired stations. I would like to give an example to the Minister of State concerning a vacant site at Derryfadda, Ballyforan, which is on the Galway-Roscommon border, where a <Col N="801" /> power station was to be built in the 1970s. It was felt at the time that that should not happen and we were then told that a peat briquette factory would be provided on the site. A road has been made into the site and all the services are in place, but the experts have told us that there was an over-supply of briquettes in the late 1970s and early 1980s and it was decided that the project was not a suitable one with which to proceed. This is a suitable site for a gas fired power station and it should be considered. Obviously a site in a bogland is not suitable for every type of industry but it would be very suited to an energy based industry. That is the reason I recommend this site, but obviously if the roads are in poor condition and there are acres of bog available, both in north Galway and south Roscommon, one cannot expect other types of industry to come into the area.</P>
    <P>Someone referred to the bogs making us poor. Let us hope that the bogs will be the raw material that will improve the incomes of the people in the area, particularly the farmers who sold or literally gave away their bog in order to have an industry based on peatland in the area. Now that we know some of the projects that are coming on board, including peat burning, gas fired and coal burning stations, we should examine the available sites that have all the services in place.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from the Western Development Commission, previously called the Western Development Partnership Board, in which it referred to the inequity between the west and the east coasts. The commission made 17 points in a submission to the Department of Finance, one of which was very simple. It stated that the gas line covers the south-east and the north, that there is no natural gas in Connacht-Ulster and that this facility attracts large energy-using industries. It is true that we will have difficulty getting industry into an area when energy supplies are not available, particularly when we have had many power cuts in the west and when the grid from Donegal to Kerry is not being fed into by the various alternative ways of producing electricity, to which the Minister referred. The Minister's announcement that he will allow other people into the market, and the whole question of competition that he raised, is welcome.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about industry and jobs, a strong case can be made for a fair allocation of resources to the Connacht-Ulster region. We know from the IDA reports that only 20% of jobs have gone to the western region. Most of them go to the larger cities like Galway, Castlebar, Letterkenny and Sligo and it is important that the other counties are not forgotten, such as Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Cavan and the rural areas of Donegal, Galway and Sligo. Those counties need the infrastructure about which the Minister spoke. We have to try to focus on these regions and, from what I hear from the IDA, the Minister and former Ministers, there will now be a focus on those regions. If additional incentives are given under, say, the Objective One category, we <Col N="802" /> will be able to get our share of the Celtic tiger. Announcements about record years for the IDA do not make sense to people if they see that jobs are not being made available for the people who live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of discussion in recent days about the health effects of incinerators. In my county of Galway, the plan appears to be to locate an incinerator near the city of Galway and the landfills in rural areas. That will be the experience in every region. I was interested to hear those who favour incinerators say they could be used to provide energy. One of the reasons they want them located near cities is to use the energy in local industries. I understand there are four sites around Galway city that could be used for an incinerator. Most of the publicity surrounding incinerators has been concerned with their effect on people's health. There are arguments for and against the dioxins produced by them. Leaving that aside, it makes sense to use such energy to provide jobs. I met Mr. Declan McCormack who is involved in a company that is talking about providing an incinerator on the M50. He is also involved in LEC 2000. As I understand it, he is talking about a mobile incinerator which can be brought to any part of the country. He maintains it will replace landfill sites.</P>
    <P>We are examining ways of recycling and getting rid of waste and the concept of a mobile incinerator is interesting. I would like to hear more from this company on whether it intends to proceed with bringing the unit to different areas. Usually when we speak of incinerators and landfill sites we want them to be located in isolated areas far away from people. However, if an incinerator can be used for energy purposes, that is something we should look at. I wish those involved in that well and hope a suitable site will be found. Obviously we have not heard the end of the debate on the health risks and environmental damage that could be involved.</P>
    <P>There is a need for renewable energy and we should support Bord Gáis Éireann in securing further gas fired stations. As we know from the 1970s and 1980s when oil was very expensive, peat is a valuable resource. Our natural gas reserves off the south coast will run out in the next few years. I mentioned the Corrib gas discovery off the west coast earlier. I understand further explorations are being conducted there and the commercial viability of the area is being examined. While we are awaiting those decisions we should remember that peat is our native source of fuel. Two new stations are being built in the midlands. It is ironic that much of the raw material for those stations will come from the western regions, the bogs in Galway and Roscommon in particular where there has always been a close attachment to the bog. Whenever an area of conservation is looked at, people are very hurt when they are told they cannot cut turf or can only cut certain types of bog.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has said about alternative energy is very important. Let us look at all the <Col N="803" /> areas and feed them into the grid. In that regard I hope the Minister will keep in contact with the farming organisations. The ICMSA has shown great interest in looking at alternative energy generation systems. There is a new organisation, Meitheal na Gaoithe, comprising farmers and other interested parties, to promote wind energy. That would be a viable alternative in the western region. I know there have been many objections in some areas, particularly in County Clare, Ballybunion, Waterford and Wexford. However, in areas where such systems have been provided they are very successful. The involvement of the farming organisations, local development associations and co-ops has meant everyone has a say in how this viable business can be run. I hope the Minister will not forget that when we are talking about alternatives ways of providing energy. That area, known as green energy, is important because we have difficulty relying on fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>The same is true regarding hydro-electricity. The Minister spoke about this in the past. We are able to provide electricity in an environmentally friendly fashion. Dams are used to provide electricity and these mitigate flooding and are tourist attractions. People can be involved in water sports, canoeing and so on if damming is done properly. The Minister for the Marine, Deputy Fahy, has been very concerned with, and has launched a document on, the potential of exploring offshore power sources. That document underlines the necessity to tap into wind and wave energy, lessen our dependency on fossil fuels and reduce the harmful effects of greenhouse gases on health and the environment. As regards sea based wind generators, the Minister is looking at an area off Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I listened to previous speakers' contributions. I oppose the proposal to appoint a regulator. People wonder why they should vote any more. As a public representative, I come into the House and am told that the powers under this Bill will be given to a regulator. If you table questions the Minister will say he has no power and that the matter must be dealt with by the regulator. We will write to the regulator and will be left waiting for months for a reply. The Local Government Bill will be brought before the House in the next few weeks and, hopefully, we will have an opportunity to address some of the <Col N="804" /> problems we have as public representatives in relation to health boards, county councils and regulators. If we write to these people we should receive a response within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I come from County Mayo. Everyone knows there has been a major gas find off the west coast. I compliment <i>The Western People</i> and its editor, Terry Reilly, who over the past few months have campaigned on this issue. In an editorial on March 8 last, it laid down a challenge to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, relating to the gas find.</P>
      <P>As a representative from the west, it would be wrong if I did not express the views of the people of the west who have been disadvantaged for long enough. We now have another natural resource, of which we have had many in the past. We saw what happened when this Government and previous Governments sought EU Structural Funds. They used the statistics of the disadvantaged area of the west and everywhere but the west gained, including the east coast and Dublin. The west has not seen any of those Structural Funds yet Dublin has received three, four and five rounds of funding.</P>
      <P>The people of the west will not allow this natural resource to be taken without gaining some benefit. As the Minister of State knows, it is proposed to close Ballycorrick power station in 2004 which employs 260 staff and 65 people who work for the ESB. This will have an awful effect on the west. Bord Gáis will run the new gas line from Dublin to Galway. I hope it continues from Galway to Mayo so the west will benefit. This is the challenge that faces us as public representatives. If we go back to the people of Mayo and the west and tell them another natural resource is being taken from the west to benefit the rest of the country and perhaps those outside it, we will have let down those we represent.</P>
      <P>A number of grids is proposed and one of those should be located at Ballycorrick. I know people will say the find has not been confirmed but the Minister of State, the Department, the shareholders and those who will benefit know there is a massive find. I am glad this will benefit the country. In north Mayo, if there is a breeze, a storm or a bit of snow falls, there are power cuts for a month and people have to wait for the ESB to come out. As a man recently said to me, if a crowd of butterflies shot across Mayo and hit the power grid, north Mayo's power would be out. The power was cut during the storms at Christmas and upset a large number of people. A recent report stated that if companies wished to invest in the west, the proper power supply is not available because the infrastructure is not in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity to do something about this. We hope Objective One funding will be announced soon, along with the Government's announcement of matching funding. We hope that at last we will get our fair share of the national cake. On the gas find, I am not an expert in this field but I have been contacted by many people who want to get on the grid. The IDA and <Col N="805" /> local government are asking the Government to fund the laying of fibre optic cables at the same time as the laying of the gas line. I hope this happens because it would be an outrage to lose this opportunity to bring the west into line with the rest of the country. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the regions benefit economically from the gas find.</P>
    <P>I have a message for the Minister and Enterprise Oil. The people of the west have been short-changed in relation to infrastructure and Knock Airport, which has not received support from the Government and has not yielded the predicted economic benefit. Knock Airport does not receive the same support from the Government as Shannon, Cork and other airports, simply because it is in the west. The editorials in local newspapers and the campaign in <i>The Western People</i> have spelt it out to us, as the people's representatives in this House, that we must ensure we get the benefits from this which will bring us into line with the rest of the country. We are in the National Parliament and we hope the country as a whole will gain but we represent a disadvantaged area. This is the greatest challenge we face as elected public representatives. The challenge facing the Government is to ensure it will put the resources in place so that whatever happens in relation to the gas find, the people of the west will gain from it.</P>
    <P>The airport and the infrastructure are there but the real support is not. Tax designation was put in place but because of the need to get approval from Europe and for other reasons, we never really got the benefit from it that we needed and hoped we would get. It is said that the rising tide lifts all boats but this does not apply to the west. A recent European report stated the poorest regions, mainly Counties Mayo and Donegal, have not gained from the economic boom. This is our first real opportunity to do so. That is why it would be wrong for me not to insist that we must get some benefit from the gas find. All political parties must work together to ensure the Minister and the Minister of State ensure the west will gain from the proposed grids. The people of the west have put up with a lot. I have been at public meetings and I have listened to the people there who will judge us and the Government if we do not see some benefits.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, Ballycorrick power station is closing in 2004. I hope the Government will consider this as a national grid location and that the Minister of State will refer to this in his closing remarks. Many people, especially the ESB workers, are concerned about the closure of the power station. There is also concern about its impact on the bogs, to which Deputy Michael Kitt referred. As a result of EU regulations farmers who traditionally cut their own turf are being told they cannot cut turf for their own use any longer. There are thousands of acres of turf bogs in north Mayo.</P>
    <P>There was an energy company up and running in the area. This week, the Minister for Arts, <Col N="806" /> Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands had an opportunity to sign an order which would allow the State to buy that resource, although I hoped we would wait for a year to see if further investors could be found for peat briquette manufacture. Obviously the Minister has no faith in the project, despite the money that has gone into it. It was bought by a Cavan man for £300,000 and he is now looking for £2 million for it. It employed 70 people in an area of high unemployment. The Government, however, did not even see fit to buy the asset. The chairman of Bord na Móna told me it would be interested in some of the assets but it would not interfere until there was a decision on whether the project would go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government got £1.7 million from a Norwegian company and that money was spent on roads when it would have been better to spend it on job creation. The State could have bought the company for a song but did not. People in Mayo are upset about what has happened with infrastructure and employment in recent years.</P>
    <P>The presence of gas means the Minister and the Government have important decisions to make. The Minister is aware of the importance of bringing resources to his own constituency. As a Deputy from the west of Ireland, I will fight hard to ensure that any infrastructure needed by Bord Gáis is forthcoming and that County Mayo will gain from this find.</P>
    <P>We do not want to listen to Enterprise Ireland. Its concerns are pounds, shilling and pence, the stock exchange. All it cares about is profit. It would not have an interest in the local economy. It is our job to make sure that the west benefits from this. The Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister of State will decide what will happen. They must make the correct decisions to enable the exploitation of a natural resource which could bring the west of Ireland into line with the rest of the State. Perhaps then the west will see its fair share of the infrastructural funding coming from Europe. We have Objective One status but it must be tied to the development of the gas field.</P>
    <P>This has the potential to create many jobs in the west. If there is a gas grid in Ballycorrick, potential investors will not be able to complain that it is not viable to go the west of Ireland. We will have a resource which will encourage them to invest, they will see the benefits of gas and, at last, we will be at an advantage compared to the rest of the State. We may even have energy at a cheaper price. That would encourage those from the west of Ireland who live all over the world to come home.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure that the officials in the Department are aware of the groundswell of opinion in the west &ndash; people want to see the benefits of this. I warn Enterprise Ireland; it will get every assistance and encouragement to invest in the west of Ireland but if the people from Mayo do not see any benefit, it will be like the Civil War. Enterprise Ireland will have a difficult <Col N="807" /> time getting that gas then. This is a natural resource that will not be stolen from us. We have lost everything else. The Land League started in Mayo and the gas league might start there as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise for introducing the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 2000. It gives all of us an opportunity to put down markers on the gas industry and its effects.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on his efforts in recent years to promote alternative energy sources, particularly wind energy. The Minister has been actively involved in this area for some time. I was surprised, therefore, by the attack on both the Minister of State and the Minister by Deputy Stagg. I was even more surprised by his attack on the Attorney General, during which he was accused of not giving legal advice on an independent and fair basis, which is simply not the case.</P>
      <P>There is still a long way to go with wind energy. While all of us are seeking alternative methods of energy generation, there is much opposition from local people. The ESB once applied for planning permission for land it owns in south Wexford to build a nuclear facility. Quite rightly the planning application was kicked out then. Recently, however, it applied for planning permission for large scale wind energy facilities. That was also refused because there is such mistrust of the ESB in Wexford. It is time for the ESB to spell out its plans for the land it owns in the county. There is a feeling that the ESB may have an ulterior motive which is not in keeping with the environment of the area and the health of its people.</P>
      <P>The only way to develop wind energy is on a community basis. A locally based community group has submitted a planning application to Wexford County Council for a wind based energy project. I hope the application will be granted because the only way forward is to involve local people in developing wind energy. People from County Wexford have gone to the Innishowen peninsula and to Britain to examine wind energy projects but they are concerned about how it might affect their environment and health. There is still much work to be done. Consultation with local communities is the way forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about giving Bord Gáis Éireann additional powers in terms of borrowing. Is the Department satisfied with the way it has extended the natural gas grid? Many countries, including Wexford, are disappointed they do not have access to natural gas. There are proposals to extend the gas grid to Arklow, Kilkenny and Carlow, but there are no proposals to extend it to Wexford in the southern corner of the south east. I ask the Minister of State to consider extending it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those working in industry and householders in Wexford have as much right to benefit from natural gas as people in other counties. I remind the Minister of State, the ESB, Bord Gáis and other <Col N="808" /> powerful bodies that Dublin is not Ireland and people in counties across the region have as much right to benefit from natural resources as people in Dublin and other big cities.</P>
    <P>The south east has not got its fair share of industry during the lifetime of the Celtic tiger. There has been very little inward multinational investment in the region. I listened with interest to Deputy Ring talk about Knock Airport. At least that region has a viable airport that serves thousands of passengers annually. The south east is served by Waterford Airport, which has been a white elephant for years. Government action is required to provide funds to develop the runways of Waterford Airport so that 747s or larger jets can land there. The south east is suffering badly due to the lack of an adequate airport in the region.</P>
    <P>At a recent regional authority meeting, I proposed that the local authorities in the region should get together and invest £1.5 million in the region, which could be matched by Government funding, to develop Waterford Airport. Given that the Minister of State lives near enough to the south east and has a voice at the Cabinet table, I ask him to take an interest in the region by urging the Government to allocate funds to develop that airport.</P>
    <P>I welcome the gas find in the west. I am sure it will be of major benefit irrespective of whether Enterprise Oil or some other group develops it. I am sure Bord Gáis will be able to tap into that development and it will benefit the economy in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the ESB and its plans for the future. There is talk of it expanding its operations in parts of Dublin and I am sure Deputy Daly will have something to say about Moneypoint and other plants. The Great Island ESB generating station in Campile has been winding down for a number of years. At a time when the country is booming, industry is progressive and there is much house-building, I am baffled that Wexford has again been pushed into the background in terms of the Great Island ESB station. I accept it is an oil powered station, and that is one of the reasons it is important the natural gas grid is extended to Wexford. Business people, consumers and others in the south east have complained about the electricity supply being cut off and others have complained about the long delay in getting an ESB connection for industry and houses. It takes four to five months for people who build new houses to get an ESB connection. The Great Island power station has been allowed to run down. The ESB needs to show some ingenuity by ensuring that station does not continue to be flagged as one that will close or where there will be job losses in the future. It should invest in upgrading it and the Government should ensure it does that.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the ESB proposed the possibility of building an incinerator close to the Great Island power station in Campile. It was proposed that such an incinerator would take all the landfill <Col N="809" /> from the counties in the south east and would generate electricity that would feed into the Great Island grid. I listened to what Deputy Michael Kitt said about the possibility of building incinerators and I can tell Members there was uproar in the south east, including in Wexford and Great Island, about such a proposal. I doubt if a incinerator will be built in Wexford in the foreseeable future. Too many factors are unknown about the impact of incineration. In a small country like Ireland where fresh produce is an important industry and food is produced to a very high standard, it is felt an incinerator would have major implications in terms of food production, agriculture, health and the environment. There are many unanswered questions about the consequences of having an incinerator and the proposal to build one in Wexford was rejected.</P>
    <P>The ESB, whether willingly or unwillingly, tried to tie a proposal to build an incinerator to the possible future of Great Island power station. That was wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for allowing me the opportunity to make a few comments on this legislation. I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, on his initiative in this area and commitment to developing this important industry.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that Bord Gáis has been a major success story. It has dealt with 300,000 domestic connections and 10,000 industrial connections and has made a major contribution to the development of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ensuring a fair and reasonable balance in the supply of gas is a challenge that faces the Government and Bord Gáis. Another challenge facing the Government is to increase gas capacity and ensure its potential is carefully developed, especially in the west. I compliment the Minister of State and the Department on their drive to encourage research and exploration on the west coast. Marathon, Enterprise Oil and Statoil have been to the forefront in this exploration commitment. According to all indications, it is a successful undertaking and the prospects are that it should be soon possible to substantially increase our gas capacity and to avail of the opportunities that will provide, especially in terms of employment, for people in that field.  I suggest that the previous Fine Gael <Col N="810" /> speaker use some caution. It is obvious in this highly technical area that many of those who will be employed in the gas installation business will come from abroad and follow the gas business. They will be professionals in the area with expertise and will enable the work to be undertaken and completed in a speedy and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>There is one omission in the Bill which, perhaps, the Minister will address in his closing remarks, the question of training for people in the gas industry. Unfortunately, it does not appear we have the capacity to train personnel. They have to go to Aberdeen to do basic training even for an ordinary job in the gas industry. The prospect of large scale employment along the west coast arising from this scheme, will be limited unless the training and expertise area is tackled. Nevertheless there is an opportunity to develop huge business which can make a major impact on our economic performance and can substantially meet some of the shortcomings in our energy supplies. The Minister indicated that 600 megawatts will be needed by the winter of 2004. This is a vast amount of energy. Even if this was to be provided by way of wind-power or wave-power stations the prospect of it being provided is limited without either the importation of energy supplies from other jurisdictions or the development of new technology which would ensure that our opportunities can be exploited.</P>
    <P>There is little reference in the Bill to the research necessary to deal with the problem of emissions from stations such as Moneypoint. If the Moneypoint station was to close tomorrow, on foot of complaints of dioxide emissions or whatever from the chimneys, it would effectively close down the energy supplies for this island and we would not have the capacity to meet energy demands. There is a need for major research into clean coal technology which would substantially reduce emissions from Moneypoint which would enable investment in clean coal technology, and investment in new technology at the station. It would be possible to build a fourth phase at Moneypoint given that the foundations and infrastructure have already been put in place. This was done while you, Acting Chairman, were Minister for Energy at the time Moneypoint station was being built. The fourth phase has not been brought into operation and it is unlikely to be brought into operation while there are concerns about emissions. Let us do research into that. Research indicates that dioxide and small particle emissions can be reduced from stations such as Moneypoint. If this can be done by way of clean coal technology, putting further investment into the scrubbing equipment in the chimneys, it would be possible to bring the fourth phase into operation. This would eliminate the need for millions of pounds of investment in peat stations and gas stations all around the island. However, that is for another day.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to look carefully at the necessity to reduce fine particle emissions. The World Health Organisation has established that up to <Col N="811" /> 100,000 Europeans die annually due to fine particle emissions from phosphate generating stations. This figure will probably increase to 200,000 deaths unless serious action is taken to remedy the situation. There is a necessity for a commitment to research in this area, whether it is done by Bord Gáis, the ESB or the Department, or by a combination of all, and the universities. If it is in line with developing trends all over Europe it should be possible to find a way in which the greenhouse gas emissions can be substantially reduced, and to find alternative ways of producing electricity.</P>
    <P>At one stage there was a proposal to build a pump storage facility near Killaloe on the Shannon. This would be a hydro facility which would not create pollution and has the possibility of producing substantial amounts of electricity to meet our demands but it is not being followed up. There is the prospect, as identified in the research done by universities, the University of Limerick included and other international universities, of developing substantial amounts of energy from wave power generation. In my constituency, Tullig in west Clare has been identified as one of the most suitable sites in the world for the generation of electricity from wave power but this is not being followed up.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to ensure a safe and sustainable supply of energy for the future. We have to reduce emissions. We have to find ways in which to protect the environment and public health. We have also to find ways in which to train people in the industry to exploit the opportunities. We can, in an effective way, meet the energy demands of this economy for the foreseeable future if we do our business right. This Bill will help in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute. Even though the Minister has left the House I wish him well in the discussions in Europe regarding the closure of Sellafield. As this is a time bomb which is ticking way he has the total support of everybody in the country in striving to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the contributions of previous speakers, particularly that of my colleague, Deputy Yates. I compliment him on the amount of research he has done on this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area, Aughinish Alumina is a prominent employer. Aughinish Alumina, Bord Gáis and ATCO Limited are forming a venture to generate their own electricity. It is vital for Aughinish Alumina and its 450 employees that this plant is provided. Aughinish Alumina will provide about 40 megawatts of electricity for the plant, a combined heat and power plant, and into the national grid which will be marketed by Bord Gáis, they will provide more than 200 megawatts of electricity. I welcome this as a step in the right direction, particularly their commitment that this plant will be in operation in 2002. It is important for <Col N="812" /> environmental standards, given the Kyoto protocol, to reduce emissions by 1%.</P>
    <P>I hope Moneypoint will follow the example of Aughinish Alumina. There has been much concern in regard to the high quantities of sulphur dioxide spewed into the estuary and the surrounding area. Some 50% of the national sulphur dioxide finishes up in that area. Moneypoint and the ESB have a strong obligation to do something about their emission levels. It is worth bearing in mind that this gas, the pipeline and its extension will not only be provided for Aughinish Alumina but could be provided for Moneypoint. This is a matter about which much concern has been expressed over the years. If we are serious about the Kyoto protocol, it behoves the operators of the Moneypoint plant to do something about the emissions in the estuary.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis has been a success story. We have come a long way since Marathon got the licence for £500 in 1970. Marathon have successfully explored, off Kinsale and Ballycotton in recent times. Gas resources are finite and possibly will run out in 2006. However, it is also worth remembering that, over those years, the State benefited to the extent of over £90 million from royalties from that operation. Up to now the terms governing our offshore gas fields have been dictated by legislation introduced originally in 1975 and modified in 1992 by a Fianna Fáil led Administration. It justified the changes to the licensing terms on the basis that it would provide a stimulus for more offshore gas exploration.</P>
    <P>Dramatic changes to the 1975 licensing terms were made. Those terms embodied royalties but they were abolished under the changes and it was decided that, in future, companies would be subject to a rate of 25% corporation tax on their profits. This might be compatible with the position in other European countries. In addition, all offshore gas exploration could be off-set by the company against future corporation taxes. The abandonment cost of wells could also be off-set.</P>
    <P>There could be a potential resource off the west coast which would not pay royalties. In addition, the costs involved in the use of wells could be off-set against taxation. The end result is that little would be paid to the economy. Many people question whether an overly generous package has been provided, but it is difficult to roll it back because the terms were introduced in 1992 and companies cannot be penalised retrospectively. Those companies would say they are taking an inherent gamble in drilling off the coastline. However, it is worth remembering that when the licensing terms were introduced in 1992, the Minister for Energy at the time was the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. The complete package for offshore gas was part of that year's Finance Bill and that legislation was piloted through the House by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is now the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, has indicated in replies to parliamentary questions that he is carrying out <Col N="813" /> an assessment of the current status. However, it is worth noting that, aside from the Kinsale gasfield, the most significant player is Enterprise Oil. When it drilled in 1996, it employed a complement of approximately 40 seasonal rig workers. They had a tradition going back to the 1970s and they worked on the wells off our coastline. They were usually SIPTU employees and they operated for a 14 week period, which is often described as the weather window with regard to offshore oil and gas exploration. This became a tradition, but recently Enterprise Oil changed the ball game completely.</P>
    <P>It decided to bring in a fully crewed rig and there is almost a battle going on between SIPTU and Enterprise Oil. This is regrettable. Ministers can hide behind EU regulations and state, as the former Minister, Deputy Woods, did and the Minister, Deputy Fahey, is doing now, that companies cannot be compelled to employ Irish workers. However, the stipulations regarding EU workers go back to 1968.</P>
    <P>If there was <i>esprit de corps</i>, which should exist, Enterprise Oil should give cognisance to employing Irish workers. I regret what has happened. In the context of long-term goodwill, Enterprise Oil is not doing itself any favours. I met representatives of the company and the offshore operators association and I made my views known. I know people who worked on the rigs in the past, many of whom came from the community in Foynes where I lived for many years. I know how they feel about what is involved.</P>
    <P>People get over-excited about developments that are taking place offshore, but we should consider logically what is happening. As I have heard and read in the newspapers, people are right to feel that if a find is 30 miles off the Mayo coast, it and all the western counties should benefit. The employment content is probably being exaggerated compared to what would materialise, but the Wood Mackenzie report quantified that there are approximately five trillion cubic feet of gas in the Slyne Trough. Regarding the appraisal wells sunk by Enterprise Oil in the Corrib field, which is in that area, the amount of gas has been quantified at one trillion cubic feet. I understand the final appraisal well has been sunk. Although the company has urged caution, there is optimism that gas is present there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring's point about Objective One status is correct; I am not in an Objective One area because I come from Limerick. However, if trenches are being dug for potential gas pipelines, it is an excellent opportunity to also lay fibre optic cable to stimulate industrial development in the west. This is most important.</P>
    <P>Regarding the three partners, comprising Statoil, Marathon and Enterprise Oil, Statoil and Marathon have a majority 55% shareholding in the investment. During a recent trip to Norway on marine related activities, I had an opportunity to speak to people there about the significant contribution oil and gas have made to the Norwegian economy. I do not suggest its success <Col N="814" /> can be duplicated here, but it is interesting to note that one of the reasons Norway stayed outside the EU was a loss of sovereignty. It felt it was a cash rich economy because of its offshore gas fields. Another reason it remained outside the EU was its concern about the Common Fisheries Policy in terms of the vital importance of fisheries to its economy. Norway appears to be extremely successful even though it is outside the EU. Statoil is a state owned Norwegian company and at home it has a strong commitment to employing Norwegians. I would hope that a nod in the right direction to Enterprise Oil would encourage it to employ local labour.</P>
    <P>There are exciting times ahead for Bord Gáis in terms of the pipeline from Dublin to Galway and on to Limerick. It will bring domestic and industrial gas to many users in the 12 towns and cities along the route. Regarding reservations about a second gas interconnector from Scotland to Ireland, on which Bord Gáis hopes to expend £300 million &ndash; I understand the design and engineering plans are being completed &ndash; it is vital that there will be a second gas interconnector in the future. Bord Gáis is only producing approximately 50% of the amount of gas required. The other 50% is supplied through the interconnector. Bord Gáis Éireannn will probably operate on short-term contracts, from six months to two years, depending on where it purchases gas. If we look to the future and examine carefully the Kyoto protocols and gas emissions, the positive direction in which to head is towards gas. We should be thankful that we have that resource and that we will have the opportunity of using gas to fuel electricity generation plants. The Bill is a step in that direction. We are fortunate, and one need only look at other countries with nuclear resources and the frightening aspects of that to realise that. Arguably the most progressive decision made was not to become involved with nuclear energy, but that is another debate.</P>
    <P>As regards Bord Gáis Éireann and Marathon, I hope a new dawn is breaking for the economy, especially given what is happening in the Corrib field. I hope that, when the results of the exploration in that field are brought ashore, further drilling will take place to tap into what is regarded as a potentially great resource. While I may have been critical in my speech of Enterprise Oil, I congratulate it on drilling when an inherent gamble may be involved. Its use last year of Killybegs port as a service facility was a token involvement because the main servicing of the offshore oil base was done from Ayr in Scotland. I was also critical in a radio interview with Des Geraghty, the general secretary of SIPTU, of its decision to place a picket on Foynes because this drove out Enterprise Oil which was using Foynes as a service location at the time. The dispute concerned a national issue of workers on offshore oil rigs belonging to Enterprise Oil. I welcome the step taken by the company recently to increase the amount of service activity in Killybegs in Donegal. It is important that, if gas is available <Col N="815" /> off our coast, the economy benefits as much as possible so that as many workers as possible from the economy are involved.</P>
    <P>This resource will be significant for Ireland's future and we look forward to the gas coming ashore. With the Marathon resources beginning to peter out, it is important to have an alternative supply in place. I understand that the Corrib gas field could extend the amount of gas to be brought ashore by another 15 to 20 years. What is happening is exciting. That said, we should not forget that multinationals can be ruthless. They are not here for the good of their health but to increase their profits, and that is understandable. In doing so, I hope they are cognisant of the potential for this country, not only in terms of employment but also in terms of energy resources for the future, which would be important.</P>
    <P>There is a great appreciation of what Bord Gáis has done over the years. Aughinish Alumina and other multinationals are often criticised. However, Aughinish Alumina, which is located in Limerick West, a constituency I represent, contributes about £56 million to the local economy, which is significant funding. I welcome what it is doing as regards improving and enhancing its industrial plant.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. As my colleague, Deputy Yates, said, there probably are certain deficiencies within it which probably need rectification on Committee and Report Stages. I would like the Minister of State to examine a statutory instrument which the Minister will introduce soon. It concerns a public service levy which is likely to be imposed on companies such as Aughinish Alumina which intends to generate 40 megawatts of electricity Is that giving a true incentive to employers with a sense of vision who build their own power plants? On the one hand they are building them at their own expense and are tackling gas emission levels while, on the other, they are being penalised by having a levy imposed. Is that the right direction in which to go? Is it possible for Aughinish Alumina to be exempt from the levy? I know my colleague has spoken about this and has written to the Minister about it. I raise it as a matter which should be considered by the Government.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Bill essentially provides for the privatisation of significant sections of our natural gas resources and of electricity generation in the State under the cover of competition. The Socialist Party is opposed to this and is opposed to the Bill. The Bill is consistent with the policy of the Government, which it has pursued relentlessly for three years, of ongoing privatisation of publicly owned companies and public assets. Almost on a weekly basis we have announcements of an intention to privatise new sectors of the economy which are in public hands through State or semi-State companies. Yesterday we had a clear signalling of the Government's intention that public transport in <Col N="816" /> Dublin, followed by public transport throughout the country, will be given to private operators and eventually privatised entirely. It is a similar case for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. If the Government is allowed to continue, almost no assets will be left in public hands, and that will have disastrous consequences when the rate of economic growth begins to decline. At a certain stage under the laws of capitalism it may even go into reverse. We will then see what compunction and compassion the new private operators will have for the tens of thousands of workers who will have been handed over to them in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an attack on public ownership of a crucial natural asset. It hands a significant section of our natural gas resource to private capitalists whose remit is not primarily the welfare of the people or workers but private profit, which they will go about shamelessly. We have a precedent and an example of what certain individuals and companies have done with assets they were given by the Government. In essence, what is being planned is the plundering of public assets, and there is no doubt that, in the generation of electricity from natural gas, private individuals and companies, if they can, will go the same road as those in the telecommunications industry. In 1996, a licence was given to a private operator for the mobile phone industry for a mere £14 million. A brief four years later, this mobile phone company was sold to a multinational with a personal profit of £250 million for one individual who obtained the licence, and millions for others as well. Everyone in the telecommunications world knew in 1996 that to be given a licence for a mobile phone agency was like being given a licence to print money, but the Labour-Fine Gael Government did that and in four short years allowed an asset that belonged to the Irish people and a crucial service that should have remained within the remit of the people to be plundered in this way for private gain. The Government now intends to do the same with another natural asset &ndash; our gas supplies. We can have no confidence in this Government protecting public assets and getting the maximum benefit for all those living on this island. What happened with the Corrib field gives an indication of how the Government will treat our natural resources.</P>
      <P>Handing over the vast wealth of the gas reserves in the Corrib field, lock, stock and barrel to multinational companies is a national scandal. It is incredible that this resource would be handed over by a Fianna Fáil Government with no royalties accruing to the State and under a tax regime that will ensure that hundreds of millions of pounds can be written off by this company that would otherwise be due to the State. We see here the folly of a State giving such power to multinational companies over significant natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Oil is a law unto itself. The Government is totally dependent on whatever information is supplied to it and appears to swallow that information uncritically when there is evi<Col N="817" /> dence to suggest that this company is deliberately downplaying the significance of the Corrib field in order to continue enjoying beneficial conditions for as long as it can. The Government has never explained why such favourable terms were given to a gas-producing company off our shores by contrast with the regime in other parts of the world; in many cases there is an average tax regime of 40%.</P>
    <P>We should know the relationships between the multinational companies and the major political parties which appear to give their blessing to this deal. We should have disclosure of political donations made by Enterprise Oil and others involved in the Corrib field to political parties so we know exactly what level of friendship exists between them.</P>
    <P>An opportunity has been lost to utilise and develop the natural resource of natural gas for the benefit of the people. A State company could have been created under the auspices of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, for instance, which could have gathered the technical expertise and investment necessary to develop our natural resources ourselves. The skills learned by Irish workers in the North Sea and other areas could have been used in such a company and we would not then have the incredible situation where we will have to buy back the total reserve from a multinational company.</P>
    <P>What confidence can we have in a Government introducing a Bill to give more concessions to private companies to make a killing out of our natural resources? Sections 4 and 5 are quite clear on publicly owned companies which want to generate electricity being kept out of the market in favour of private companies. That is the effect of section 4. It does not just apply to the ESB but to other organisations that might come in. It is clearly designed to give the benefit to private operators.</P>
    <P>There is already evidence from other countries that the scramble to deregulate electricity generation is damaging to people's interest, to economies and to the environment. A major study carried out by the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Working Group from 1992 to 1997 found that the deregulation of electricity generation contributed significantly to a deterioration of environmental controls and standards in the deregulated companies. For example, 42 of the largest electricity companies in the United States completely eliminated their investments in energy, efficiency and programmes to cut down emissions. Those cuts meant that in those years 11 million tons of global warming gases and 79,000 tons of soot and pollutants were pumped into the air as a result of those cutbacks by private firms in the electricity provision in the United States. We have a smaller economy on a smaller scale, but we will have the same pressures and laws operating. It is already clear that the Government is not taking seriously either environmental control or the most efficient use of natural gas in conversion to electricity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> For example, the Huntstown project, for which permission has been granted in Fingal, is merely a station generating power from gas. Why is there no provision that any company coming in should combine power and heating programmes in one project when that is the most efficient way to use the available energy? If the Government goes down this road, the policy should not be one of massive generating stations in green field areas, but one of smaller scale generating stations which would combine electricity generation with district heating programmes as well. That would ensure the maximum capacity and benefit for people as well as ensuring the least amount of waste of resources.</P>
    <P>Serious environmental questions are now being asked. The application to build at Platin on the banks of the Boyne is causing alarm in the local community as well as among ordinary people and environmental groups. The drastic effect a station of that capacity would have on the water of the Boyne and the amount of water that would be taken and not replaced is staggering. It is a matter of developing this in a calculated way for smaller stations and of combining heating with electricity generation. The emphasis in general should be on the creation of energy from sources with the least emissions. In this regard wind power must be further investigated. There are problems with communities who must be treated sensitively &ndash; one cannot ride roughshod over anybody. Renewable energy which does not result in emissions is the way forward.</P>
    <P>Instead of giving important sections of our national assets to privateers, we should have a renewal and revamping of public ownership, although not in the bureaucratic way of the past where publicly owned and semi-State companies on occasion operated even more clumsily than capitalist firms with bad industrial relations. A revamped energy generating company in public ownership with the involvement of the workforce, consumers and representatives of environmental groups, etc., should be charged with generating the necessary energy in the most environmentally friendly way possible. That is the way forward, rather than the Government policy of handing everything over to privateers for private benefit and a private killing. Cé mhéid ama atá fágtha agam?</P>

        <b>: </b>Is náireach amach is amach an polasaí atá an Rialtas ag iarraidh a chur i gcríoch sa Bhille seo. Is é atá i gceist ná acmhainn lúchmhar &ndash; gás nádúrtha &ndash; a thabhairt do chomhlachtaí príobháideacha chun aibhléis a ghinneadh agus chun brábús príobháideach a dhéanamh seachas an rud ba cheart a dhéanamh, sé sin polasaí a chur i gcríoch a bheadh ar mhaithe le muintir na hÉireanna i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> Is le muintir na hÉireann an achmhainn seo agus ba cheart go mbeadh an buntáiste as ag dul do mhuintir na tíre seachas do chomhlachtaí príobháideacha. Tá fealsúnacht atá thar a bheith coimeádach ag díriú an Rialtais seo le trí bliana anuas. Teastaíonn uathu más féidir gach comhlacht poiblí a phríobháidiú. Tá sé dochreidte mar a dheileáileann an Rialtas leis an ngás atá faoin bhfarraige amach ó chósta Mhaigheo. agus ó chósta na Gaillimhe fé mar a thugadar an achmhainn lúchmhar seo do chomhlacht idirnáisiúnta, Enterprise Oil. I ndáiríre, caithfidh muintir na hÉireann an gás sin a cheannach ar ais ón chomhlacht mór seo. Tugann Alt 4 agus 5 den Bhille seo le fios go mbeidh cosc curtha ar chomhlachtaí stáit go dteastaíonn uathu cur isteach ar chonradh aibhléise a ghinneadh agus an buntáiste ar fad a thabhairt do chomhlachtaí príobháideacha. Tá tionchar mór ag ginniúint aibhléise ar chúrsaí timpeallachta. Tá impleachtaí díriailiú don timpeallacht sna Stáit Aontaithe, fuarthas amach tré staidéar a deineadh, gur gearradh siar ar infheistíocht a laghdódh an damáiste a déantar don timpeallacht nuair a deineadh díriailiú ar ghinniúint aibhléise.  Dá bhrí sin cuireadh na mílte tonna d'ábhar truaillithe isteach san atmasféar.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that this issue should arise at this time. As a Member of Fine Gael I believe it is our turn to contribute and I am fully entitled to speak.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of going into the legal or technical details of the Bill as my colleague, Deputy Yates, and others have done that and will do so on Committee and Report Stages. I welcome the find of gas off Kinsale. We also welcome the find off the west coast and hope it will become commercially viable. Obviously, we need to get the most benefit possible from it, but we must ensure the industry gets some recognition for the costs it will encounter in trying to find gas in such a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>The interconnector has been in place for many years and has been very useful. According to the Minister's statement it is now nearing capacity and we need new provisions to carry gas from the European gas fields. I welcome the commitment in the Bill and given to Bord Gáis Éireann in that regard.</P>
      <P>Once again it seems that at least in part of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan there are no plans for a gas pipeline. Much of the Bill concerns the use of gas by electricity power stations and if we are to have a proper spread of power stations we must have pipelines in areas such as north Monaghan. There is a gas pipeline going to Carrickmacross, including Lough Egish industrial estate, which I welcome. I have no doubt that the Lough Egish industrial estate can and must be one of the major flagships of the food industry and every opportunity to lower costs and make it as competitive as industries in other areas must be welcomed. However, there seems to be no proposal to run a gas pipeline to areas such as Castleblaney, Ballybay, Monaghan town or Clones. The list proposed by Bord Gáis Éireann includes many other towns in the Objective One area to which industries are being directed by the Tánaiste if we are to believe what has been stated in press releases, etc. The statement issued by Bord Gáis Éireann of 9 November 1999 includes the following towns: Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Athenry, Longford, Loughrea, Galway, Gort, Kinsale, Killaloe and Shannon. Unfortunately, important towns are left out, particularly when one considers the peace process and everyone's hope that life will return to normal in the North after this weekend. With the exception of Donegal, the most northern region of the Twenty-six Counties should not be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Natural gas is cleaner, cheaper and more convenient for householders. People building new estates in areas that I mentioned should have the same right to that gas as anybody else and our businesses should enjoy a similar advantage, <Col N="821" /> especially those which are extensive energy users. For example, in County Monaghan the food industry is extremely important and energy use is high. The Tánaiste in the past few days admitted that there is a serious problem enticing industry to set up in the Border region, especially in Cavan-Monaghan. It is essential that is fully recognised. All types of infrastructure must be available if there is to be an even spread of industry and jobs in the regions.</P>
    <P>There is also a difficulty in the Border region regarding the N2 and N3 motorways. There has been no indication yet as to when the bypasses of Monaghan, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross will be undertaken. There are also difficulties with telephone services for industry in the area. Recently awarded private contracts went to the west and other regions, but not to the Border region. Gas is another element of infrastructure. If Bord Gáis Éireann needs financial assistance to justify running a pipeline to Monaghan, it must be given that help through whatever means.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that a power station fuelled by waste from the agricultural sector will be built in the region. Ways and means of utilising it to generate power and heat are under examination. I was interested in Deputy Higgins's reference to power and heat earlier. I, with other Members, travelled to Finland as part of an interparliamentary delegation last December. We saw that most of Finland's power stations provide not only power but also heat and, obviously, it is much colder there than in Ireland. A local authority delegation visited Denmark to examine ways to manage all forms of waste. Some Danish villages are built near power stations which use waste and which are supported by gas. If gas were available in north Monaghan, it would be easier to guarantee power in all circumstances and, thus, provide for the establishment of a much needed waste management service.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you were present, as I was, when the Taoiseach visited Cavan town last week. He emphasised the need to ensure that people and, consequently, jobs and infrastructure were spread evenly. I accept that the Taoiseach meant that. I hope, through whatever means, it is ensured that a gas pipeline, as part of the infrastructure for the region, will run along the Border and service the region and that there will not be more impediments than are necessary. The 30 odd years of trouble in that area has been an impediment. Ireland has interconnectors to the North Sea through the UK. It is important that the Border region, which has suffered most as a result of the troubles, should not be forgotten in the plans for the provision of gas as part of the new infrastructure for the region.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an mBille. Le linn don díospóireacht seo a bheith ar siúl sa Dáil tá taispeántas ar siúl san RDS ar a dtugtar An Seó Fuinnimh 2000. Tá sé urraithe nó ar a laghad curtha i láthair ag an Ionad Fuinnimh, the Irish Energy Centre. Is cúis <Col N="822" /> díomá domsa nach bhfuil an Bille &ndash; the Irish Energy Centre Bill &ndash; os comhair na Dála faoi láthair nó nach raibh sé os ár gcomhair i bhfad roimhe seo agus na billí Fuinnimh seo ag teacht chun cinn. Is trua san mar léiríonn sé nach bhfuil an rialtas ag smaoineamh go hiomlán ar an bhfreagracht idirnáisiúnta atá orainn maidir le ceisteanna caomhnaithe seachas maidir le príobháidiú fuinnimh.</P>
      <P>Go pearsanta ba mhaith liom a rá go mbainim féin úsáid as gás sa bhaile nuair is gá agus tá sé áisiúil gan aon dabht. Ach maidir leis an mBille seo, níl sé chomh mór agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach leis an mBille Leictreachais a chuaigh roimhré. Ach é sin ráite is Bille tábhachtach é do chúrsaí fuinnimh ar fad. Dar leis an Chomhaontas Glas is céim ar chúl é ar bhealach chomh maith mar is píosa den achmhainn nádúrtha é an gás atá sa tír. Tá sé ann ní hamháin ar son an ghlúin atá ann anois ach ar mhaithe leis na glúnta atá le teacht in ár ndiaidh. Níl mise den tuairim go mbeidh na comhlachtaí príobháideacha a bheidh ag baint tairbhe as an ghás seo ag smaoineamh go ró-mhinic ar na glúnta atá le teacht. Beidh siad ag smaoineamh ar dheireadh na bliana, ar na daoine atá páirteach sa chomhlacht agus ar dhlí na tíre agus sin an méid.</P>
      <P>An rud is tábhachtaí ar fad sa díospóireacht seo ná go gcreideann an Rialtas &ndash; taréis an méid atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit &ndash; gur leor an méid atá ar siúl acu chun an t-atmasféar a shabháil ó ghásanna ar nós carbon dioxide agus mar sin de atá á scaoileadh amach san atmasféar. Ach ní leor é. Tá go leor daoine idirnáisiúnta ag rá go bhfuil Éire as smacht ar fad ó thaobh eisiúint carbon dioxide de. Glacaim leis nach bhfuil gás chomh dona le gual nó le h-ola. Ag éisteacht leis na daoine ó Fhine Gael anseo in aice liom cheapfá gurb ionann gás agus cumhacht na gaoithe, cumhacht tonnta agus cumhachtaí gur féidir a athnuachaint mar sin. Is bréag é sin agus ní féidir linn glacadh leis. Is fíor nach bhfuil gás ag bun an dréimire, áit atá gual agus ola ach go háirithe, ach níl sé ag barr an dréimire ach oiread. Tá sé áit éigin i lár baill agus ba cheart dúinn é sin a aithint agus a rá arís agus arís eile ar eagla go mbeadh daoine ag ceapadh gur ionann gás agus an ghaoth, rud atá bréagach ar fad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa chomhthéacs sin bhí díomá orm chomh maith nuair a chuala mé gur cheap an Coimisiún um Rialú Leictreachais &ndash; the Commission for Electricity Regulation &ndash; nach raibh dualgas mór orthu tús áite a thabhairt do chumhacht na gaoithe, go raibh siad ag féachaint ar an Acht nua ach nach raibh an dualgas go pearsanta orthu. B'fhéidir go ndéarfaidís go raibh an dualgas ar an Roinn Chomhshaoil agus gur leor sin. Ach má labhraíonn duine leis an Aire Comhshaoil Nollaig Ó Díomsaigh, déarfaidh seisean go bhfuil freagracht ar gach Roinn cumhacht agus an timpeallacht a chaomhnú agus mar sin de. Déarfaidh sé go bhfuil gach Roinn fite fuaite maidir leis an timpeallacht de agus <i>eco-audity </i>mar a tugtar air. Ar an láimh eile de má labhraíonn duine leis an Aire <Col N="823" /> Fiontair Poiblí déarfaidh sise agus an tAire Stáit go bhfuil an freagracht ar an Roinn Comhshaoil. Tá dhá scéal ann mar sin ach ba cheart scéal amháin a bheith againn agus an rud a chur ina cheart mar tá an fhadhb seo ró-dháiríre ar fad le haghaidh na meáin chumarsáide agus an cineál PR spin a chuirtear ar na ceisteanna seo ar fad. Beidh mise ag labhairt leis an Choimisiún um Rialú Leictreachais chun é sin a rá go díreach leo agus an rud a phlé chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is fiú dúinn féachaint taobh amuigh den Stát ar an cheist seo. Is fiú dúinn éisteacht, cuir i gcás, le hoifigigh na haimsire sa Bhreatain agus i Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá. An Nollaig seo caite, 1999, d'eisigh siad litir go dtí na meáin chumarsáide a dúirt go lom agus déarfaidh mé mar a scríobh siad as Bearla é:    &ldquo;The likely consequences of our past and ongoing activities: (ó thaobh ghinniúint leictreachais agus úsáid fuinnimh agus mar sin de) more extreme weather, rising sea levels, changing participation patterns, ecological and agricultural dislocations, and an increased spread of human disease&rdquo;. They concluded that &ldquo;ignoring climate change will surely be the most costly of all possible choices for us and our children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sin oifigigh na haimsire. Nílimid ag caint mar gheall ar aon ghrúpa comhshaoil nó ar dhaoine a bhíonn ag caint mar sin de ghnáth. Tá sé ráite sa mhíniú a théann leis an mBille nach mbeidh aon chostas ar an Stát leis an mBille, gur rialú atá i gceist agus ní costas a bheidh i gceist. Dar liomsa tá costas an-mhór i gceist má éisteann tú le hoifigigh na haimsire. Tá níos mó fuinnimh á úsáid anois ná mar a bhí riamh cheana. Cé íocfaidh as an costas ag deireadh thiar thall, an costas a éireoidh as an píonós a ghearrfar ar an tír seo i ngeall ar Chonradh Kyoto? An íocfaidh gach leanbh agus gach duine fásta as nó an íocfaidh na comhlachtaí móra a bheidh ag baint tairbhe as an reachtaíocht seo agus as an gás, an achmhainn nádúrtha a bheidh á thabhairt againn dóibh? Sin ceist a chuir mé go minic sa Teach seo agus taobh amuigh de ach ní bhfuair mé aon fhreagra go fóill. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil fhios ag an Rialtas cé íocfaidh agus má tá níl siad sásta a rá agus cuirim an cheist arís anseo inniu.</P>
    <P>Tá costas áitiúil ag baint leis an mBille seo chomh maith ach níl sé sin luaite sa Bhille féin. Tá costas do phobal ar bith atá in aice le rud a tugtar &ldquo;stepdance station&rdquo; air. Is Teachta Dála mé do Bhaile Átha Cliath Thuaidh. Tá fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil stepdance station i Ros Eo agus cé go dtugtar Lough Shinney ar an áit, tá sé in aice le heastát mór tithíochta St. Catherine's. Tá, nó bhí ar aon nós, boladh láidir i sráid bhaile Lough Shinney agus i Ros Eo féin a chuir tinneas ar dhaoine agus bhí imní ar go leor daoine as an méid gáis a bhí ag teacht isteach ansin agus as cad a tharlódh dá mbeadh fadhb ann. De réir dealraimh tháinig 70 faoin gcéad de ghás na tíre isteach ansin anuraidh. Sin costas ar phobal agus cé gur chaith Bord Gáis Éireann £10,000 ar an bpobal sin chun an fhadhb a réiteach tá costas an-<Col N="824" /> mhór ann ó thaobh imní de agus ó thaobh rudaí eile a lua mé. Níl sé sin luaite sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Chuir mé ceist ar an Aire cheana féin maidir le cé íocann as ghinniúint fuinnimh sa tír seo. Labhair mé ar an mBille Leictreachais mar gheall ar chonas is féidir linn níos mó cumhacht gaoithe agus mar sin de a úsáid mar tá sé ar fáil. Tá sé saor in aisce, ní dhéanann sé aon dochar don timpeallacht agus mar sin de. Dúirt an tAire liom i litir nach n-íocann an Roinn as cumhacht gáis nó cumhacht guail nó ola agus mar sin de agus mar sin go raibh cothrom na féinne ann. Chomh fada agus is eol domsa, leis an phíoblíne a tháinig isteach idir Alba agus an tír seo bhí 35 faoin gcéad den chostas sin tógtha ag an Aontas Eorpach. Is mór an bronntanas é sin do na comhlachtaí móra a bheidh ag baint tairbhe as an gás chomh maith. Ó thaobh cothrom na féinne de ceapaim féin gur cheart ar a laghad an méid céanna a thabhairt do chumhacht na gaoithe chun é a chur chun cinn nó chun taighde a dhéanamh ar an chineál teicneolaíochta atá ag teastáil chun cumhacht tonnta, cumhacht na gréine agus cumhacht na gaoithe agus mar sin de a úsáid. Mura ndéanfar é sin ceapaim go mbeidh an Rialtas ag obair in aghaidh na timpeallachta arís agus arís eile.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Finucane ó Fhine Gael Statoil agus ní raibh ormsa dul go dtí an Ioruaidh chun an méid a dúirt sé a fháil amach. Tháinig muintir na hIoruaidh anseo mar chuid den chuairt a bhí ar siúl ar an Choiste Fiontar Poiblí. Fuair mise amach ó mhuintir Statoil nach raibh plean acu stáisiún giniúna a thógáil san Ioruaidh. Cé fáth? Mar bheadh an iomarca gáis, an iomarca carbon dioxide, de thoradh an stáisiúin sin, agus ní bheadh cead acu é sin a dhéanamh. Tá orthu teacht go hÉirinn chun stáisiún a thógaint anseo agus tá orthu dul go Vietnam chun stáisiún a thógaint mar nach bhfuil cead acu é a thógaint in a dtír féin. Léiríonn sé sin caighdeán comhshaoil níos aoirde san Ioruaidh ná mar atá sa tír seo. Ní dóibh liom gur féidir leis an Rialtas a bheith bródúil as an caighdeán íseal atá acu ó thaobh cúrsaí comhshaoil de go mór mór nuair atáimid ag briseadh limistéar Kyoto cheana féin mar is eol don Aire.</P>
    <P>Taréis don Bhille seo a bheith in a Acht, agus is dócha go mbeidh, an féidir leis an Aire geallúint a thabhairt nach mbeidh feachtas fógraíochta ar siúl ag aon chomhlacht mar a bhí ar siúl ag Bord Gáis Éireann nuair a bhí siad ag iarraidh daoine a chur ag úsáid gáis. Cuma an raibh gás ag teastáil uathu nó nach raibh bhí siad ag spreagadh daoine gás a úsáid má bhí sé ceangailte sa teach acu. De thoradh sin tá aithne agam ar go leor daoine a deir gur ghá dóibh méid áirithe gáis a úsáid nach bhfuil ag teastáil uathu chun praghas an gháis a ísliú sa bhille. Mar sin, d'fhágadar fuinneog ar oscailt agus iad ag iarraidh gás a úsáid mar a bheadh sé ar fáil go buan. Rud scannalach a bhí sa bhfógra sin ó chomhlacht stáit. Is léir go raibh an rialtas féin an mhí-fhreagrach gan smacht a chur ar an chomhlacht agus feachtas fógraíochta mar sin ar siúl acu.</P>

      <Col N="825" /> Cá bhfuil an caighdeán fuinnimh chun fuinneamh a chaomhnú? Bhí mé ag comhdháil an tseachtain seo caite i gColáiste na hOllscoile i mBaile Átha Cliath, áit a raibh The Irish Home Energy Rating Standard á chur i láthair do thithe nua. Bheadh eolas ag an Aire Stáit ar rudaí mar sin mar tá mé taréis a léamh sa nuachtán mar gheall ar an fháilte a chuireann sé roimh rudaí mar seo. Ach níl an Rialtas ag gníomhú de réir an chaighdeáin seo chomh mór agus atá siad ag gníomhú ar ghiniúint leictreachais agus ar phríobháidiú gáis agus mar sin de. Is mór an trua é sin. Cuir i gcás, tá go leor daoine ar ioncam íseal agus ní féidir leo fuinneamh a chaomhnú mar is féidir le daoine a bhfuil airgead acu agus ba cheart deontas a thabhairt do na daoine sin i dtreo is gur féidir leo a bheith compórdach, rud atá bunúsach, agus gur féidir leo gan a bheith ag úsáid fuinnimh atá teoranta agus a dhéanann dochar don timpeallacht ag deireadh thiar thall.</P>
    <P>Cá bhfuil an riachtanas chun district heating a bheith mar chuid den ghiniúint leictreachais? Táimid ag tabhairt cead do dhaoine stáisiúin a thógaint agus nílimid ag cur aon riachtanas orthu distict heating a chur ar fáil, rud atá scannalach arís ó thaobh Kyoto agus ó thaobh an airgid a bheidh le n-íoc againn nuair nach mbeimid in ann teora Kyoto a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt don méid a dúirt an Teachta Crawford, ba mhaith liomsa a rá go bhfuil an-chuid ábhar gáis i gContae Mhuineacháin agus ar fud na tíre i bhfoirm an méid slurry a bhíonn ann de thoradh na muc, na gcearc agus mar sin de. Tá an-chuid de sin ag dul amú sa tír seo. Tá sé ag dul isteach sa talamh. Tá an talamh ar nós spúinse agus loite ag an ábhar gáis seo atá ag dul amú. Ba cheart anaerobic digesters a bheith i ngach contae sa tír seo mar tá an-chuid gur féidir a bhaint as, methane mar shampla, Ba cheart é a dhó chun leictreachas a ghiniúint seachas é a scaoileadh isteach san atmasféar, áit a dhéanann sé dochar sé oiread níos mó ná mar a dhéanann carbon dioxide. Go bunúsach is rud riachtanach agus rud práinneach é sin. Iarraim ar an Aire sin a dhéanamh go tapaidh. Cé mhéid ama atá agam, a Leas Cheann Comhairle?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there are many people who will not have the opportunity to listen to a translation of my contribution, as Members of this House have with the translation service. The Green Party is disappointed that the Bill will privatise a natural resource which is both important and also potentially damaging if used badly, given our commitments under the Kyoto agreement which are already being broken. The Department of Public Enterprise has a solemn duty to play its part as a major user of energy in terms of its remit, particularly with regard to the likes of Aughinish Alumina and other large energy users in the country, including the ESB. It should be at least as serious about it as the <Col N="826" /> Department of the Environment and Local Government is expected to be.</P>
      <P>In relation to global warming, the meteorological offices in Britain and the USA have warned that if we neglect the climate change issue it will be the most costly of all possible choices. There is a cost implication arising from the Bill, even though the Minister did not state that in his explanation of it. It would be unfair if that cost were to be paid by every child and adult in the country. It should be paid by the largest energy users in proportion to the amount of energy they use which creates greenhouse gases. That is a question which has yet to be answered by the Government.</P>
      <P>I hope there will not be a repeat of the scandalous advertising campaign in which Bord Gáis engaged. It offered cheaper gas if customers used a lot of it and it resulted in people leaving their windows open so that they would use gas and not be too hot. That was a scandalous advertising campaign. This Bill is not as important as the type of legislation needed to improve energy conservation so that we might start the downward demand on energy instead of accepting that it always has to increase. Other countries have managed to decouple economic activity from energy demand and it is about time, as a civilised country, that we put our house in order and ensured that an Irish home energy rating standard and other energy conservation measures are enacted and enforced in order that we can start to comply with some of the international regulations in terms of climate change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of the utmost importance that the pipeline runs through County Sligo. Local industry and the general community have a right to a choice of energy options, as is available in most areas of the country. I welcome the prospect of a supply offered by the discovery of a natural gas field in the region. According to An Action Plan for the Millennium, the intention is to extend natural gas, as far as practicable, to major towns and cities. County Sligo should be connected to the national grid. That can be accelerated with the prospect of natural gas being brought ashore in the north west, particularly in light of the Enterprise Oil venture which I believe will be successful.</P>
      <P>Sligo, as the capital of the north west, on the periphery of Europe, is the self-selecting natural centre of the focus for the Border region, as concluded by the Fitzpatrick report on the Border, midlands and western region and endorsed by the Border, midlands and western regional authorities. It is recognised that Sligo is by far the largest town in the north west region, where a great deal of infrastructural investment has already taken place, but Sligo has infrastructural deficits which need to be addressed to enhance its access and competitive position, to promote inward investment and develop its potential as the main regional growth centre in the Border, midlands and western Objective One region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Sligo has many of the ingredients necessary for the development of a vibrant growth centre &ndash; a scenic coast location, roads, an institute of technology, a regional airport and a sea port which, I understand, the Minister for the Marine visited a few weeks ago. There is much work that could be done and investment is needed. Sligo also has arts and cultural facilities and a Government agency. However, action needs to be taken to consolidate its position, including mobile investment and economic and social development.</P>
    <P>As regards the electricity supply to Sligo alternative energy options should be examined. Sligo has failed to attract international investment projects in the information technology and telecommunications sectors. The quality of electricity supply is a major requirement in attracting and supporting the retention of these and other major industries as well as for the effective functioning of the economy in general. For these reasons a 220KV electricity supply is a priority. Unfortunately, it is only coming as far as Carrick-on-Shannon. That is a major disadvantage. Due to cross-Border development, to which Deputy Crawford referred, and particularly the development of the gas supply, it is a matter of the utmost importance that the pipeline be extended to Sligo. It is imperative, as Sligo is the capital of the north west, that there be cross-Border discussions on the new and exciting times that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Investment in a high quality electricity supply will help to remove any disadvantage in terms of the quality and cost effective energy supply that might militate against the attraction or retention of small, medium or large sized enterprise and local employment. A quality of supply of international standard will also help support agri-tourism, a potentially important rural enterprise. The development of enterprise will, in turn, help to stem the tide of migration to Dublin in search of employment, assist the regeneration of local communities and meet the explicit objective of Government and EU policy.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Oil, the British exploration company, has discovered a major natural gas field off the west coast. Initial estimates suggest that the find will be bigger than the Kinsale field. However, when the gas eventually comes ashore it will be hardly worth it to the Exchequer, from a revenue point of view. I understand Enterprise Oil prefers to base its operation in Aberdeen in Scotland. There was an impression that many jobs would be created here but advances in mining technology and the use of hi-tech equipment to extract gas from the newly discovered Corrib gas field will generate few jobs.</P>
    <P>As Enterprise Oil has stated in a feasibility study of the area 70 kilometres from Achill Island, unmanned submarines will be deployed to perform tasks on the seabed. It states that the drilling manager puts much effort into getting as many people onshore as possible for safety and cost benefit reasons. The depth of the seabed means they will have to go down 350 metres <Col N="828" /> below sea level. The logistics involved in the extraction make for a long and costly process as Enterprise Oil plans to put six wells in place by the year 2002. People are under the impression that there will be many onshore jobs. It will require a great deal of effort to secure most of the eight onshore jobs it takes to support each job on an exploration rig. However, the number of jobs that will be created must be clarified. If we take the case in Kinsale there are very few jobs on land arising from the development of offshore exploration. Many people in local authorities believe there will be a massive job loss but jobs will be created through the extension of the pipeline and the benefits that will follow from that.</P>
    <P>If the pipeline is extended into Sligo there will be long-term benefits for the region that will accelerate the creation of a growth centre. What is needed in Sligo is a centre to generate electricity that will attract industry to the northwest. At present there is a 110KV supply. That is a huge disadvantage and if there were a greater supply the benefits from potential job creation would be enormous. As regards the digging up of roads there should be integrated planning so that, for example, where a pipeline was being laid a fibre optic cable could be laid at the same time. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland would be well aware of the advantages of such an approach. There is uncertainty about where the pipeline will go and if linked up with the pipeline from Mayo to Galway via Tuam I believe there would be a significant opportunity to develop industry along the western pipeline.</P>
    <P>It is important that such development be incorporated and that there be an action plan. Bord Gáis has given assurances on continuity of supply but it is important that the pipeline is extended into western areas, particularly the north west where I have the honour to represent the Sligo-Leitrim constituency. We have the potential. Sligo has been designated as a major growth centre. Thanks to the generosity of the tax regime there will not be any revenue for the State. Preferential treatment for exploration companies was introduced under the Finance Act, 1992, in the form of a 25% tax rate. In the rest of the world the average rate is 40%. In Norway all companies that enter its waters are taxed at a rate of 75% and it insists that drilling companies employ Norwegian services and workers. Enterprise Oil can also offset its past exploration expenditure, including capital expenditure, against its tax bill. Considering that it is a costly business, Enterprise Oil has claimed to have spent over $50 million, one wonders when the Exchequer will see any tax revenue. It will probably be in 80 or 90 years.</P>
    <P>The real benefit is in the location on the west coast of Ireland, cross-Border benefits and the fact that we can accelerate developments in the region. We are an Objective One area as part of the BMW region and the development of the gas pipeline presents us with a unique opportunity. I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at Sligo <Col N="829" /> as a connection for the pipeline. It would open up a new avenue of development. Sligo is the natural growth centre of the north west. It is the largest centre in that region and can stake a claim to the pipeline. I know it will be a political decision but it is in the interests of Government with the clearly established new growth centres in the national plan to avail of each opportunity to create them. The offshore development of gas presents such an opportunity and I welcome it. It is a good form of energy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently launched the report of a trial of three V.I.A. classification systems, carried out jointly by my Department and Teagasc. The trial involved a comprehensive examination of the ability of three machines to predict the carcass fat and conformation grade based on the EUROP grid given to carcasses by a panel of three classifiers and also to estimate meat yield.</P>
      <P>The trial showed that the machines were able to predict conformation and meat yield with a relatively high degree of accuracy but they had a lower accuracy level in the case of fat cover. In general, the conclusion can be drawn that mechanical classification has considerable potential but the machines tested did not achieve the level of accuracy set down by the European Commission in their initial draft regulation for the standards to be attained by these machines prior to their approval for official use.</P>
      <P>However, following representations by my Department, the Commission now propose to allow for further trials prior to setting down the precise standards which these machines must achieve. My Department will continue to work with the developers of these machines to assess whether their accuracy can be improved and with the Commission to ensure that the standards set down in EU regulations reflect the current state of the technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, it will not be possible for a mechanical classification system to replace the current system of manual classification until EU regulations have been amended to provide for the use of machines. For approval, any mechanical system must be capable of meeting the standards set down in these regulations. However, pending the <Col N="830" /> introduction of mechanical classification, it is open to the industry and individual producers to use the machines to underpin a graded pricing system based on the meat yield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that I compliment the Dawn Meats Group, Paul Allen from the National Food Centre and Nicholas Finnerty from the Department for spearheading this project. Given the subjectivity which has bedevilled meat grading, unless it is carried out by mechanical graders we will never get proper quality meat. The new mechanical graders are not good on fat content or colour, with which they cannot deal properly. Will the machines be used as an alternative from now on? Will the Minister outline the next stage in the mechanical grading process? Is he raising the regulations with the EU Council of Ministers? It is vital for our beef industry that the mechanical graders can do what I hope they can in relation to lean meat content.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also compliment the Dawn Meats Group and the Department and Teagasc for their comprehensive work on this series of trials. They have been successful in a number of areas. A further series of trials need to be conducted to allow the European Commission approve the overall mechanical grading system. We expect this approval will be given by the end of the year. In the meantime, I would encourage processers to use the system as far as saleable meat yield is concerned. The system is also good on conformation. It is important to remove the suspicion of subjective grading from the system and to achieve objective grading, which would be a considerable improvement. We are working with the European Commission to ensure the system is introduced comprehensively before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear in recent public statements that I see a need for an improvement in the quality of Irish cattle as measured against the EUROP carcass classification grid. However, primary responsibility for brining about this improvement rests with the beef industry itself through better breeding and husbandry practices which, I believe, can best be encouraged through a more effective graded pricing system at meat factory level. While this is essentially a matter for the industry itself, I have asked the beef task force monitoring committee to progress the issue of graded pricing. The recent trial on mechanical classification, which was supported by my Department, and the current moves at EU level to set the standards to be met by mechanical classification systems, should facilitate this process.</P>
      <P>On the breeding front, Teagasc has recently undertaken a series of demonstrations around the country to promote better breeding. Teagasc is now also using focused programmes to proactively promote the production of quality beef on a cost effective profitable basis using efficient breeding and feeding systems. In addition, the pooling of resources and expertise in the cattle breeding area to form the recently established Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, is providing a real opportunity to make significant progress in developing the breed characteristics of our beef cattle.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of ICBF is to improve the genetic merit of the national herd, particularly by improving genetic evaluation and information on breeding quality. Breeding objectives are being clearly defined in the context of changing market requirements and farming systems. ICBF is working to identify our top bulls through genetic evaluation and the use of sophisticated IT systems. It will then be for all the relevant interests in the industry to promote the widespread use of those selected bulls. I am satisfied that, if properly implemented, all these measures should assist farmers to produce higher grading beef more efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree only those who produce the highest quality beef will have a profitable future. This applies to the 130,000 farmers classified as cattle or beef farmers in some form. Given this fundamental premise, does the Minister agree there is a problem with the fact that less than 40% of the progeny emanating from the beef suckler cow herd &ndash; which is the genesis and basis of the Irish beef industry &ndash; is suitable for the high priced European markets? At the National Open Beef Day in Grange &ndash; I do not know if the Minister of State was there but his colleague the Minister was &ndash; it was stated that 60% of the progeny from the beef suckler cow herd are graded at U, the high grade, whereas less than 20% of the carcasses from the beef suckler cow herd are currently graded U. This is the essence of the problem. <Col N="832" /> Does the Minister agree this is why we are only achieving less than 20% penetration in the high quality competitive markets?</P>
      <P>Another problem is the subsidy regime under which the same subsidy is available for a Holstein calf emanating from a primarily dairy herd, 90% of which only grade as O, compared to a continental cross from a Fresian herd. Will the Minister ensure some differential in the subsidy regime in favour of beef farmers producing for the export market or the live market here?</P>

      <P>Our beef and dairy production sector is one of the strongest in Europe. The average for Europe is that 66% of the herd produce dairy and 34% beef. The Irish herd breaks down on a 50-50 basis between dairy and single suckling. Single sucklings are the flagship of the beef industry now, particularly on the western seaboard where there are good breeds such as Belgian Blues, Sementhals and Charolais. In comparison, only 12% of the German herd is suckling.</P>

The Deputy is well aware of past movements when the dairy herd was the basis of our beef industry. We have since moved away from that and there are many clubs which could act as models. Other organisations in the beef sector, such as feed and silage producers, are getting involved and working progressively. It is important that we have a continuous supply of beef for many of the markets, particularly the retail, which wants beef 365 days a year.</P>

In the case of such transactions, there is no requirement that the subsidy be repaid.</P>
      <P>Milk producers who have to cease production temporarily due to exceptional circumstances, such as ill health or family bereavement, can temporarily lease their quota for at least three milk years under the provisions of the above mentioned regulations. It is also possible in the case of a family transaction to transfer the quota by way of a lease of the lands to which it is attached.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present considering applications for exemptions from the general three year rule from approximately 120 people who, for exceptional reasons such as ill health, family bereavement or animal disease, have been unable to produce milk during the last three milk quota years and who, for similar reasons, are not in a position to recommence milk deliveries during the 2000-01 milk quota year. The closing date for such applications was 12 May. Each application is being considered on an individual basis and will be judged on its own merits.</P>

      <P>In so far as producers were in receipt of a 50p per gallon subsidy from 1995-97 when they were buying milk at £2 per gallon, can they sell that milk in the same manner as those who have owned the quota all their life?</P>

      <P>One of the conditions of the 50p subsidy scheme was that the producer should remain in milk production until the end of the quota system or the year 2000, whichever was the earlier. Therefore, such quota could not be sold by them until 2000. It can now be disposed of by being sold into the 2000 restructuring scheme, by being sold with land in a permanent transfer of land and quota, or by being transferred by way of sale, lease, gift or inheritance with land as a part of a family transaction. There is a wide designation of relatives, including grandparents, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, aunts and uncles. It can be temporarily leased provided the three year limit is not exceeded. It can be traded, sold, leased or inherited in the same way as any other quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme for the on-farm certification of dairy cows was relaunched in May last <Col N="835" /> year following negotiations with all parties involved and it is now operating reasonably well. While progress in having certification provided was slow to begin with, I am pleased to note that more recently there has been a significant upsurge in activity under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme is an important one for the industry as a whole and needs to be completed as quickly as possible. I, therefore, have no proposals for the postponement of the 30 June deadline. I again strongly urge producers to have the necessary certificate completed and submitted to their dairy co-operative as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development raised the matter with ICOS earlier this year and subsequently wrote to the executives dealing with the scheme in each of the co-operatives urging them to use their influence to ensure their suppliers meet the deadline. A press notice was also published in the farming press at the beginning of this month reminding producers of the deadline. In the final analysis, it is primarily a matter for the industry to ensure that this certificate is brought in on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of the dairy health certificate is good from a food safety point of view. Does the Minister understand that failure to extend the deadline will criminalise half the dairy farmers in the country and will leave the co-operative movement in a legal limbo, in so far as it should not collect milk from farmers who have not submitted their dairy certificates?</P>
      <P>As of yesterday, 15% of Dairygold's suppliers have submitted their dairy health certificate. The reason for that low percentage is a bungling in the Department in terms of responsibility for paying farmers in respect of this scheme. There is a stand-off in the rural community between veterinary practitioners and farmers on this issue because there is no clear indication from the Department as to who should pay. Should it be part and parcel of the herd test? Some vets sign on the round herd test while some insist on calling on a separate day, ask for the herd book and raise matters that have been covered under the dairy hygiene regulations. There is administrative incompetence in the Department in dealing with this issue. It is imperative this deadline is extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department, after consultation, with the farming organisations and the veterinary organisations launched the scheme as long ago as May 1997. Since then the farmers and the veterinary association have been endeavouring to progress it. It is very much a matter <Col N="836" /> for the farmers and their veterinary surgeons to ensure certificates are signed. In some co-operatives more than 50% of milk producers have got certification, while in others the figure is as low as 15%. It is greatly in the interests of the dairy producers and their co-operatives to ensure that this certification is up to date. It is not a matter for the Department to become involved in matters that essentially are matters for dairy farmers and their veterinary surgeons. The Department has encouraged, in every possible way, the industry to meet this deadline.</P>
      <P>I use this opportunity to say to the industry that we are an internationally competitive industry. The industry needs this certification. I know of one case where a valuable contract was lost because certification was not available. We cannot continue with such a level of dependence on export requirements without meeting the certification requirement because there is a requirement for quality assurance in the food industry. Given that from 1997 to date we have not been able to achieve this requirement, we need to be more serious about ensuring it is met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Department and Minister can wash their hands of the stand-off between the veterinary union and practitioners and dairy farmers. I urge the Minister to urgently revisit this issue. With regard to the 30 June deadline, which he said he will not extend, I seek an assurance from him that the co-operatives will be in a position to collect milk from all producers after 30 June, regardless of compliance with this certificate, and that farmers will not be left in a position where milk cannot be collected because of a stand-off between their veterinary practitioners and themselves, which is the primary responsibility of the Minister to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Milk will be collected from farmers but there will be certain contracts which it will not be possible to meet because of lack of certification. If dairy farmers want to get the best possible price and want to have access to the main markets, it would be prudent for them to get their certification in order. There have been requirements in the milk industry down through the years in relation to hygiene, quality and certification and, by and large, the dairy industry is a model for the remainder of the food industry. I am disappointed more progress has not been made in relation to this essential requirement. There is no great pressure on anybody in this regard. The majority of farmers have good working relationships with their veterinary surgeons and this certification is provided on the day of the annual round test.</P>

      <P>This measure will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region.

      <P>Primary responsibility for the improvement needed in the grades of Irish beef cattle rests with the industry itself, in particular, through better breeding and husbandry practices and the operation graded pricing. However, in view of the importance which I attach to bringing about an improvement of the grades of Irish beef, I have asked the beef task force monitoring committee to progress the issue of graded pricing, which I believe is a vital prerequisite for the production of better quality cattle. In addition, my Department is strongly supporting moves at EU level to introduce mechanical classification in order to provide a more objective basis for a graded pricing system.</P>
      <P>As far as breeding is concerned, the breeding demonstrations undertaken by Teagasc around the country earlier this year, combined with the activities of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, are designed to promote the value of better breeding practices among Irish producers in order to bring about an overall improvement in the quality of Irish cattle and, in that way, ensure that the beef processing sector has an adequate supply of quality beef to meet the requirements of the European market.

      <P>When the Deputy referred to whiteheads I thought he was referring to my head. Flat rate pricing has not helped the beef industry. There is a tendency towards flat rate pricing at present and that is an upsetting factor in terms of quality. We cannot have quality if there is equality of price. I agree breeding is vitally important. While the quality of our beef is among the best in Europe based on the statistics available to me, the breeds which will be important for the future are Limousin, which has a high kill-out with muscle, good confirmation and good quality, followed by Belgian blues, Sementhals, Charolais, Angus and Herefords. Herefords are the bottom of the pile.</P>
      <P>If there is to be efficiency in the beef industry the first breed mentioned is important. I have been told about kill-outs on bull beef and Limousins of 66% as against 56% from the traditional breeds here. Those breeds would mean an increase of £40 to £50 per head to an Irish farmer. Breeding will have to be directed in that direction and farmers will have to be encouraged to get the best breeds available. We have model suckling herds in the western seaboard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The price paid for cattle in Ireland is determined by market forces and is essentially a matter between purchasers and vendors. In general, prices for similar grade cattle do not vary greatly from one geographic region of the country to another. However, in order to ensure maximum transparency in prices paid by meat factories, I have arranged since early February for the publication on a weekly basis of steer prices paid by named individual meat factories. This will enable producers to make country and industry wide comparisons of the prices being paid for cattle of similar grade and type and minimise price differentials between factories, except where they are justified by market forces.</P>

      <P>The Department's report which was covered in the national newspapers indicated that meat plants in the south, particularly in the Cork region, are paying 4p per lb. less than their market competitors elsewhere. That is difficult to <Col N="841" /> explain to farmers in County Cork. With two Ministers from the area we would expect the meat plants in Munster, and particularly in Cork, to lead the way. The Minister will be aware of the huge anger earlier in the year about beef prices. The Department's report indicated a 4p per lb. differential for similar grade cattle. Unless action is taken farmers in the south, in County Cork in particular, may well take to the streets again. Has the Minister raised with the relevant meat plants their failure to pay prices similar to those of other meat plants for similar grade cattle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Minister of State nor I fix prices. That is a matter for the industry. The Deputy is correct in saying the price differentials between plants in one area over another are available in the weekly farming news. In the southern part of the country prices have been lower. The reason given for this when the Department followed it up is the greater concentration of the dairy herd there and the Holstein element in the breed. The Department has published the figures. The Government established a three-person group to look into any price fixing. That group is expected to report next month. Also the Department decided to establish a price transparency mechanism based on independent verification. Good progress is being made on that issue in the beef task force monitoring committee under Dr. Tom O'Dwyer. There is a range of measures to give greater transparency in the whole system to ensure people get a fair price and that there is no geographical distortion.</P>

      <P>The Agri-Food 2010 Committee has recommended the establishment of a nationally accredited food industry training system benchmarked to the best international practice. The recommendation is currently being examined in line with the procedure for consideration of the committee's report.</P>
      <P>My aim is to provide a comprehensive response to the findings and recommendations of the report and, to that end, I have commenced a process of consultations with all relevant interests to ascertain their views on the report's recommendations. I have also established a working group comprising senior officials in my Department which, in addition to considering the report, will draw up a timetable for implementation of relevant recommendations. I expect the process to be completed in June.</P>
      <P>The training needs of the food industry were recognised in the national development plan. The importance of training in the context of issues such as food safety and productivity was highlighted and an indicative funding provision of £31 million was made. In drawing up the detailed arrangements for the allocation of that funding, I will ensure that due account is taken of whatever conclusions emerge from the examination of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely happy with the current position and I established a group which, I understand, will report to me next week or, at latest, the following week. This group which is chaired by Mr. Donal Creedon, the former Secretary General of the Department, deals with the training needs of the industry. When I visit plants, I am always impressed when I am introduced to a person with responsibility for quality, hygiene and the HACCP and other control systems with regard to food processing activity. It is essential to have proper hygiene and quality standards, particularly nowadays because people are eating outside the domestic environment more often.</P>
      <P>I am progressing programmes to ensure there is proper training for individuals working in the food industry. I favour the establishment of a nationally accredited scheme so that people receive certificates at the end of training programmes in which they have participated. This is most important.</P>

      <P>Recently Dr. Patrick Wall of the Food Safety Authority appeared to indicate that while there had been reasonable progress on the issues the Minister mentioned, there is a huge problem regarding the mishandling of food in the home. His view is that a great deal of food poisoning arises because people do not understand how food should be handled at home. Is there an overarching committee involving the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? Is it carrying out any investigations because this matter involves food, safety and health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that many non-nationals are now working in the food industry, are any plans in place to ensure there is training in a number of different languages? This matter is hugely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the deterioration of standards in the home has nothing to do with the greater participation of males in the kitchen in these enlightened days. However, on a serious note, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland was established. Dr. Wall is the chief executive and he is doing a very good job in highlighting these matters. He is giving good advice to people in relation to food generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Food is an ideal host for bacterial spoilage and people can get food poisoning easily if there is any slippage in standards. In the home, if cooked and uncooked food is not kept in separate compartments in the fridge, contamination can easily take place. Training should start in primary schools to ensure people have an appreciation of the damage bacterial spoilage can cause. People in food establishments can easily put down or <Col N="844" /> drop a piece of equipment on a table or on the floor and then pick it up and start working again without realising that cross-contamination has taken place.</P>
    <P>Training and an appreciation of micro-organisms which can cause problems is vital. I take Deputy Upton's point that this training must be carried out in various languages. In a food plant I visited recently, almost one third of the workers were non-nationals. It is difficult to get staff for food establishments at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of beef is the responsibility of Bord Bia in conjunction with the industry. The promotion of Irish beef by these interests is heavily based on the fact that it is largely produced from grass-fed cattle which are reared in animal welfare-friendly conditions and the beef is a wholesome healthy food.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular health benefits of grass-fed beef, initial research by Teagasc indicates that, by comparison with beef produced from concentrates or silage, grass-fed beef contains lower levels of saturated fatty acids and higher levels of conjugated linoleic acids and is, therefore, more compatible with modern medical advice on diet composition. Teagasc is currently undertaking research to enable it to design feeding practices which will optimise the concentrations of &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; fatty acids in meat produced not only from grass but other feedstuffs commonly used in Ireland. The objective of this research is to provide information to farmers to enable them to produce beef with lower levels of saturated fatty acids, thereby further improving the competitiveness and attractiveness of Irish beef on export markets.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister intend to use this information to promote Irish beef on the home market and also internationally? Historically, beef has a bad track record in relation to health aspects. This type of positive information should be promoted to encourage the buying of greater amounts of beef on the European and home markets. How does the Minister intend to promote the selling of Irish beef?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Research is ongoing. When it is completed, we will know whether it is possible to promote grass-fed beef specifically in relation to its anti-carcinogenic advantages. As the Deputy is aware from last week's meeting in Grange, at which the Minister, Deputy Walsh, was present, Dr. O'Riordan has done some work in this area. We await with great anxiety the findings in the area of anti-carcinogenic advantages. <Col N="845" /> The Deputy is more familiar with this area of microbiology than I would be and I greatly admire her for her interest in it. Teagasc has a programme entitled, Grass-Fed Beef: A Natural Health Food, which is organised in collaboration with the National Food Centre, where Dr. Vivian Tarrant is in charge. A great deal of work is ongoing in this area. While I have no findings, it will be an exciting development should it reach fruition, and we hope it will go the favoured route of saying that Irish beef has the health advantage.</P>

      <P>Every other country is similar to us in trying to market its beef. While everyone in the House justifiably believes that Irish grass-fed beef has the advantages the Minister of State outlined, how is that handled in terms of marketing strategy on the export market? How does An Bord Bia get the message across to customers who purchase the product?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Connaughton is aware, since the formation of An Bord Bia a number of years ago, we have marketed Irish beef on the basis of being pasture-fed, and that has been a bonus for us. Intensive marketing programmes are in place in Italy, the UK, France and Holland. The Minister and An Bord Bia publicised the advantage of grass-fed beef using the logo &ldquo;Beautiful grass makes beautiful beef&rdquo;. Trojan work has been done in the area. We are the only country in Europe which has this natural, green image. None of the other member states have that, so we have a natural advantage, such as New Zealand. We have done a great deal of work and it is paying off. People want our beef and an increasing amount is being traded. It is a tragedy that we must sell half our beef to third country markets, but we are withdrawing from those and selling on the quality markets of Europe.</P>

      <P>This is obviously an exciting development at the Teagasc research centre in Grange and is something which will have long-term benefits for the industry if it can be carried through. However, it is also tremendously expensive. Does the Minister of State believe <Col N="846" /> research funding is adequate for the type of research needed which is of a long-term nature?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to sound a note of caution about the research. While I agree that Irish grass-fed beef produce is of excellent quality, we are also trying to break into other markets in continental Europe where there is a need to produce beef from cattle fed on cereals. It is necessary to ensure we get the correct texture of meat. We need to be selective in our marketing approach and in the use of that research because other high quality markets which we are pursuing are not necessarily interested in that form of beef production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that there is a need to include other feed as well as grass. With new technology, we are now growing large quantities of maize as forage, especially in the southern part of the country where the weather is milder and yields a good crop. That is assisting us.</P>
      <P>Another benefit of the research is that the beef showed a marked increased in linoleic acid content which is proven to protect against cancer, obesity and heart disease. There are many advantages to this research. While I have no qualifications in the medical area, this appears to be exciting news. I compliment Teagasc in the work it has done to date and I believe there will be additional findings.</P>

    <P>Specifically in relation to TB, it has been agreed to commit resources in each district veterinary office to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdowns, to take a proactive approach to the removal of all sources of infection in each DVO area using 75 dedicated departmental and farm relief service personnel and to concentrate their efforts in the 20% of the country which yields 50% of current reactors.

I asked Teagasc about its course and services some time ago and <Col N="849" /> the greatest demand from young farmers is for IT services and courses. I know Deputy Creed visited the IT laboratory in Darrara Agricultural College, which is widely used and for which there is a waiting list of farmers and their spouses. Many farm spouse with guesthouses use the Internet and e-mail for guest registration. Teagasc provides a relatively short course leading to the European computer driving licence in IT skills and that is being widely availed.

I believe it is a good scheme and to that end the new scheme was submitted to Brussels in December. We are told by Brussels that it hopes to have the scheme ready for the summer &ndash; which is the same situation as with the installation aid scheme &ndash; but, having regard to <Col N="850" /> past performances by the European Commission, I believe it will be later in the year. I would welcome the early approval of the Commission and everything is being done to secure that approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an earlier question on installation aid, to which the Minister referred. It and the early retirement scheme have been very successful and were primarily devised to increase land mobility and the transfer of farms to younger people. Notwithstanding these very good schemes, why is it that the age profile of farmowners is still excessively high? It is a grey industry and we need to look at the effectiveness of these schemes as a tool for facilitating the transfer of land to younger, qualified farmers. Ownership in the industry has not changed despite the success of these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Creed is correct that an inordinate number of farmers are in the older age bracket. Given the opportunities now available outside farming, as someone put it to me recently farmers can now afford to educate their children up to third level, but their farms cannot provide a reasonable income and lifestyle for those graduates. If they get opportunities elsewhere they avail of them. Members will know of cases where farmers find it difficult to take up the family farm and to accept what would have been regarded a fairly good living in our generation.</P>
      <P>All these schemes &ndash; farm retirement, installation aid, training and IT skills &ndash; are being provided to improve the situation, but that is not happening on the ground. While people are entitled to options other than farming, we must try to retain people in rural communities and give them opportunities there also.</P>

      <P>Many farmers are waiting for this new scheme and cannot make decisions as a result. Regarding the old scheme, why, despite the commitment to a two month turnaround from the date of application to the date of award of grant, is that observed more in the breach than the compliance? We in Westmeath and the midlands find there are not enough staff to deal with the assessment of submitted forms. Is that the position? Will the Minister investigate why it is taking so long for those in the midlands, especially in Longford and Westmeath, to get farm retirement scheme grants? Those people submitted forms before 31 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Following CAP reform in the early 1990s and the more recent Agenda 2000 a range of new schemes was brought into operation and the Department was stretched in a number of counties and areas. It took a long time to process some schemes &ndash; longer than should be necessary. The good news is that we have approval for additional staff for a number of those schemes and also for a number of staff in the key IT area. <Col N="851" /> The difficulty is that the staffing of Departments is the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission and once approval for additional staff is received advertising must take place and panels must be formed. Often it is found that those on the panels have taken up very good jobs in some of the e-commerce companies. In many cases staff trained by the Department leave and avail of better jobs outside the constraints of the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some informal discussions have already commenced with farming and industry representatives concerning the operational aspects of the national beef assurance scheme at farm level. Since the national beef assurance scheme legislation was enacted, there has been extensive redrafting of the texts of the proposed farmer declaration, inspection report and certificate. In addition, there have been both formal and informal contacts with the farming and veterinary representative bodies. I intend to continue these discussions and contacts over the coming weeks to secure agreement as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There has already been extensive consultation with the relevant interests prior to the publication of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill in July 1999. Now that the legislation has been enacted, my objective is to finalise the outstanding aspects with the minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>On this basis, registration of participants could commence this autumn, to be preceded by an information and publicity campaign, and on-farm inspections would take place during the 2001 annual TB round. In the interim, to avoid discrimination, all parties will be given provisional approval under the scheme.</P>

We want the inspections and certification to take place during the annual round test. We hope to get agreement between farmers and veterinary personnel so there is not a burden of any kind on farmers in relation to the scheme which is essential.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, An Bord Bia, the industry and I have gone throughout Europe and to third country markets.

      <P>The Government has engaged an independent group of consultants to examine allegations that the Irish beef industry engages in anti-competitive practices and their report is expected shortly.

      <P>As the actors say, &ldquo;They would say that, wouldn't they?&rdquo;. The Minister was at the <Col N="854" /> meeting with Commission Fischler on 30 March in Dublin Castle. What does the Minister think of his comments that the effects of a formal cartel were virtually evident? Was the Minister surprised that he drew attention to the fact that after the EU began paying winter premium for cattle being slaughtered, the price started to decrease within a week to exactly the same level as before the premium? What does this indicate to the Minister? The Commissioner said he did not find an adequate explanation for the farm gate price differential between Irish cattle and those on continental Europe, and I ask the Minister to comment on this. Can he proffer an explanation given that Commission Fischler could find none? Is there an explanation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Farm organisations were very successful in January in trying to break this cartel. What steps will the Minister be able to take if, when cattle numbers are high at the back end of the season, the same effort is made by factories to cut prices? Will he be able to help farm organisations avoid such a situation? The only way to avoid it is to ensure the live export trade to Libya and other such places is opened to ensure proper competition. I appreciate there are live exports to Europe, but these are high quality weanlings rather than beef. Opening the live cattle trade to Libya and such places is extremely important if the cartel is to be broken.</P>

      <P>Commissioner Fischler said he could not understand the difference in prices between here and continental Europe. He also referred to the fact that when the deseasonalisation premium was reduced by 4p per pound, prices also reduced everywhere by the same amount and he could not get an adequate explanation for that. Europe has a domestic market and Ireland has a large export market but at the same time the Government has established a three man group, including Professor Séamas Sheehy. It is to report by the end of next month and we await its outcome. The group should provide an explanation for these matters and ascertain whether there are any difficulties.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on European Aspects of the Drugs Issue.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleagues, Deputy Gregory and Senator Ryan, the joint rapporteurs, on this report. It is encouraging for members of the committee, given their enthusiasm and dedication, that they should be given an opportunity to discuss the report in the House. It has been difficult to schedule such debates over the past few years because of time constraints. This is the fourth in a series of debates on committee reports which have been taken over a short period. That is appreciated, although there are a number of others to be debated.</P>
      <P>As a former Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare and former member of the ministerial drugs task force, I am aware of the evolving problems related to the drugs issue. Against that background I was pleased that this report was included in the joint committee's work programme. Special provision for the drugs issue was made in the Amsterdam Treaty. In that context committee members felt that, given the increased incidence of drug abuse throughout the developed world, it was necessary and timely to take the issue on board. The committee set about its work in energetic and forthright fashion and Deputy Gregory will elaborate on that.</P>
      <P>The committee received great co-operation from various agencies and bodies with which it held discussions. It would be easy to have a discussion for half an hour or an hour, write up a report and hope it is relevant, but intensive fieldwork, investigation and research was carried out. The report was published in January 1999 and an updated version will issue shortly &ndash; we also hope to bring that before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rapporteurs were also helped by the chairman and members of the national strategy committee on drugs, the health research board and by a presentation from former Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, who addressed a joint session of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Health and Children and European Affairs in October 1998. I <Col N="857" /> thank all the contributors for their help in the compilation of the report.</P>
    <P>The report addresses the drugs issue in both a European context and a social and educational context. It outlines in detail the St. Gallen heroin addition programme in Switzerland, to which Deputy Gregory and others will refer. I also acknowledge the assistance given to the committee rapporteurs by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. The committee has also had discussions since the report's publication, which will be outlined in a further report. It is important that reports are updated on a regular basis because of the evolutionary nature of European legislation. They lack relevance when they are out of date.</P>
    <P>The drugs issues comprises a number of frightening elements. It is an insidious, evasive problem which can assail all sectors of society and can pervade the entire social spectrum. A criminal element is involved which generates massive sums from the distribution of drugs. It behoves all of us to attempt to identify new methodologies to address the problem given the changing circumstances with which we are presented.</P>
    <P>The report examines a number of them. All the methodologies that have been availed of to combat the drugs issues in terms of prevention, enforcement and treatment have been well and truly tried and tested. Some have worked while others have not but it is imperative that alternatives are examined on an ongoing basis, even on a trial basis, to ascertain what impact they may have. The report bears that out. Many of the recommendations in it are presented merely to enable the public and Members to make up their minds as to whether experimental ideas followed in other countries should be adopted. We can draw on some useful experiences but it is absolutely certain that whatever happens in regard to the drugs issue in terms of prevention, enforcement and treatment, every avenue must be examined in future to ascertain which is the most likely to succeed. I commend the report to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the following contribution on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan. I welcome the debate for two reasons. First, it gives the House the opportunity to consider the report which has been prepared by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and, second, it gives the House an opportunity to discuss our drugs policy here in Ireland. I am glad there appears to be a broad consensus on all sides of the House on the main thrust of that policy, which has developed largely from two excellent reports produced by the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, as well as my party's policy document entitled A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drug Related Crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> The Government is determined to tackle the drug problem effectively and has committed significant resources towards achieving this aim. Over £1 billion is earmarked in the national development plan to implement a range of social inclusion measures, including initiatives to respond to drug misuse.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy are available in almost every town and young people everywhere are experimenting with them. However, in Dublin, where heroin is also available, we have the added problem of crime as drug users steal to feed their habit, as well as the spread of diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis contracted through the sharing of unclean needles.</P>
    <P>The Government has put a comprehensive package of measures in place to tackle these problems. We have brought forward legislation to increase the powers of the Garda Síochána and other authorities to tackle organised crime and drug dealing. The Criminal Assets Bureau, in particular, is seen as an extremely effective weapon in our armoury against the drug barons. We are now denying those criminals the opportunity to enjoy the wealth they have amassed through inflicting misery on others. However, as those working with drug users know only too well, we cannot solve the problem simply by cutting off the supply of drugs. We must also put in place a range of education, awareness and other measures to prevent young people from turning to drugs in the first instance, as well as treatment and rehabilitation options for those who are already addicted.</P>
    <P>Although the report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs refers to &ldquo;unacceptably long waiting lists and a grossly inadequate programme of aftercare and rehabilitation&rdquo;, we have made significant strides over the past few years in providing new drug programmes and services. In fairness, the committee's report was compiled a year and a half ago, so it could not have taken account of the considerable progress that has been made in responding to the drug problem in the interim. Indeed, a recent independent evaluation of the Eastern Regional Health Authority's drug services found that it had made remarkable progress in developing and expanding its range of services in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>The numbers in treatment in the ERHA area, for example, have risen from about 1,400 in 1996 to nearly 4,500 this year, although unfortunately we have not yet reached the stage where we have eliminated the waiting lists completely. This is basically because more and more drug users who were previously unknown to the treatment services are now presenting for treatment as our services develop and expand. That, in itself, is a positive development as the more people we can encourage into treatment the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> Some people might argue that there may be as many as 13,000 heroin users in Dublin and that, therefore, only about one third of them are in treatment. The reality, however, is somewhat different. It must be realised that not all heroin users are ready to present for treatment at any given time. Our aim must be to make sure that when they present themselves, the services are there for them. The ERHA, in whose area the vast majority of heroin users reside, estimates that if it provides a further five or six treatment centres it will be very close to eliminating the existing waiting lists. The ERHA's drug service plan for 2000 is geared towards this aim.</P>
    <P>It also needs to be taken into account that the report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs was prepared before the excellent work of the local drugs task forces had an opportunity to impact fully in the areas in which they operate. The task forces have made considerable progress in the three years since their establishment. As a result of initiatives developed through them, we have set up nearly 50 support and advice centres for drug users and their families. More than 4,000 drug users and 3,000 families have availed of these services. In addition, nearly 350 schools have participated in drug awareness programmes with about 6,000 school children being involved in these programmes. Some 350 teachers have received training and more than 300 youth groups have run drug prevention initiatives.</P>
    <P>Training programmes have been delivered to 1,300 community workers, 1,200 parents and 1,300 young people outside the school setting. Over 160 resource materials, such as videos, leaflets, and brochures with drug awareness messages have been developed and disseminated in all the task force areas. This represents a significant achievement and I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record my thanks and appreciation to the State agencies and, of course, the voluntary and community groups which have brought this to fruition through their work on the task forces. In particular, I wish to thank the voluntary and community representatives who have given so generously of their time and energy.</P>
    <P>I also wish to thank the national drugs strategy team for its excellent contribution in overseeing and supporting the work of the task forces. An independent evaluation of the local drugs task forces, undertaken in 1998, confirmed that they have been a huge success. The evaluation found that they had achieved a number of notable successes over a very short period, not least in the manner in which they have reduced the isolation and frustration previously felt by many in the communities where the drug problem is at its worst.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputies who work in these areas will have noticed a marked increase in the morale of community and voluntary drug workers <Col N="860" /> since the setting up of the task forces. I am pleased to see that Deputies from all parties and Independent Members are now participating in the work of the task forces. I know that elected representatives can considerably enhance the effectiveness of the task forces through their intimate knowledge and experience of drug issues in their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I compliment the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the work it has done in compiling this important report. In particular, the work undertaken by Deputy Gregory and my party colleague Senator Ryan, the rapporteurs, was excellent. I compliment both of them on their efforts. The report itself is clear, concise and accessible. It contains important, up-to-date facts and figures concerning drugs across Europe. Such information is essential for an informed and objective debate.</P>
      <P>Before speaking about the report's contents and recommendations, I wish to say a few words about the spread of illegal drug use in Ireland in recent years. I have been deeply involved in sport all my life through my association with sports clubs and the GAA in particular. I would like to think that I have a reasonable idea of the threat currently facing young people as a result of drug abuse. Illegal drugs pose a grave danger to a whole generation of Irish youth. The issue must receive priority attention from this House and from the Government.</P>
      <P>Until a decade ago illegal drugs were relatively rare in rural towns. The drugs trade was largely confined to major urban areas, with Dublin bearing the brunt of the appalling destruction heroin can wreak on working class communities. In the 1980s, I recall reading a book entitled <i>Smack</i> by journalists Seán Flynn and Padraic Yates. This ground-breaking publication laid bare the violence and tragedy surrounding the drugs scene in our capital city. Even today that book makes chilling reading.Since the 1980s, however, the nature of the drug trade in Ireland has changed substantially. Drugs, especially cannabis and ecstasy, are now readily available in towns across rural Ireland. The major drug gangs have spread their evil beyond the confines of major cities and every community and family must be aware and vigilant about the drugs threat. The use of illegal drugs has been a truly national issue for many years and this report is an important contribution to the debate on the way policy should respond in the face of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the use of illegal drugs, I compliment the committee on including in the report a section on the alarming increase in tobacco and alcohol use among Irish youth. It is important to recognise the horrific damage these legal drugs are inflicting on our population and I fully endorse the committee's recommendations that urge the Government to address the high levels <Col N="861" /> of abuse of these two drugs among young people in particular.</P>
    <P>Following extensive consultations with a variety of experts, the committee made a number of sensible and rational recommendations which deserve to be given urgent consideration by the House. It is right and proper that a committee of this House should examine the European context of drug abuse. Recent changes to the European treaties, especially the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, give the European Union an increasing role in what are termed &ldquo;third pillar&rdquo; issues. It is now a fact of our membership of the European Union that a greater degree of co-ordination between member states in relation to justice and home affairs matters will occur over the coming years. Given these developments, the policies and practices of our European neighbours in relation to drug issues should be examined by policy makers.</P>
    <P>The committee has made six recommendations. The first is a structural matter in relation to the manner in which we co-ordinate our national policy towards drug abuse. It is a proposal which I know has existed for a number of years and I hope the committee's endorsement of this proposal will spur the Government to action. In particular, I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendation that a sub-group on drugs in prisons be established.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year my colleague, Deputy McManus, published a comprehensive document on health care in Irish prisons. I urge the Minister to closely examine that excellent document. Unless our prisons have a comprehensive drug rehabilitation programme, the vicious cycle of drugs, poverty and crime will never be broken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent if somewhat belated announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in relation to drug courts. I urge the Government to bring a comprehensive report on the operation of that system before the House following its first 12 months in operation.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee rightly underlines yet again the intractable link between heroin abuse and poverty. Given the experience which both Deputy Gregory and Senator Ryan have in working with severely disadvantaged communities, I hope their conclusion will convince the Government that at a time of unprecedented economic boom, the fruits of that boom should be used to launch an all-out assault on the scandal of poverty which still blights Irish society.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Minister to accept the emphasis the committee makes in regard to tackling disadvantage at primary school level. One of the most deeply depressing interviews I ever heard on radio was with a priest from an inner city parish of Dublin a number of years ago. The priest told how, at the Christening of an infant in his parish, he knew that the child would more than likely <Col N="862" /> end up a victim of drug abuse by his teenage years unless the political system woke up to the urgency of the crisis. There is a moral and political obligation on this Government and subsequent Governments to ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to education and employment. Diverting extra resources to primary schools which suffer enormous disadvantage and are at the heart of communities that have borne the brunt of drug abuse for years is absolutely imperative.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the fifth recommendation of the committee which calls for an informed debate on cannabis use. I am totally opposed to any relaxing of the law in relation to drugs, and that includes cannabis. I have no opposition to an informed debate but I am utterly opposed to any proposal which would increase the amount of drugs available in society. That is the wrong way to approach the problem. Eradicating drug abuse, rather than regulating it, is the only sane and rational way to proceed. I compliment the committee on its report and I urge the Government to take action on foot of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I compliment the chairman of the European Affairs committee and the rapporteurs, Deputy Gregory and Senator Ryan, for bringing forward the report and providing us with an opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>One of the first engagements the European Affairs committee had shortly after being set up was to go to Brussels to meet the Commissioner in charge of that particular portfolio who was very exercised about two issues. The first was the major problem of dealing with trafficking in drugs and in human beings. She was so exercised she was at the stage where she did not quite know what to do about it.</P>
      <P>This country has made significant strides in tackling that issue, and I compliment previous Governments also in that regard. Deputy Gregory knows as well as I do about the enormous problems we had with heroin in the 1980s, which still exist, but we are now more conscious of the need to deal with those and we are devising strategies which are quite effective. The European aspect of the problem has been brought home to us by the spate of gangland murders and what would appear to be, in an incident in my constituency, a copycat murder last weekend. I compliment the Garda on the prosecution of that particular case and hope there will shortly be a successful conclusion to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a variety of initiatives in this area that are working well. Deputy Gregory and myself are members of the Finglas and Cabra drugs task forces and I am also a member of the Ballymun drugs task force. I am aware of the previous plans and also of the plans that have been prepared for the period from now until 2006 to <Col N="863" /> deal with issues. Innovative programmes have been proposed and others are already in place. The youth services facilities fund has made a remarkable contribution and I compliment the Government for setting aside substantial funds to provide programmes and facilities in areas where little or nothing existed previously.</P>
    <P>We are doing well in the areas of prevention and enforcement and I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for introducing a raft of quite draconian legislation. I heard a commentator on radio last week compliment the Government on its legislative measures in this area and calling them the best in western Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall referred to the drug courts. I understand from the Minister that work is progressing quickly and the planning group is ready to bring forward its proposal. I look forward to that as another initiative in the area of drugs prevention. The Garda's clean streets campaigns, which are ongoing, are very effective and gardaí are engaging more seriously with local communities. They work on drugs task forces and on various community initiatives.</P>
    <P>The level of awareness of the issue is much higher than it was previously. That has a lot to do with programmes that are being delivered through schools. The CYC in Dublin, the Dublin Youth Services Board, the National Youth Council and teachers in schools are delivering the various programmes which have been devised by the Department of Education and Science, and they are making a significant impact.</P>
    <P>On the issue of treatment, perhaps I am speaking prematurely but in most cases we are a lot more mature now in examining the way treatment services are provided. As the Minister said in his contribution, with five or six more treatment centres in the Dublin area we will be close to reaching the majority of those in need of treatment. Many people would say we are only managing the problem. We are far from reducing the levels of abusers. Programmes are constantly being brought forward. I compliment the Finglas South and the Project West community development projects for producing an extremely user friendly drug awareness and front-line training pack, called DAFT, which I had the pleasure of launching in Finglas last week. That raises issues about a whole range of drugs and it does not pull any punches about the dangers. It refers to a major problem that we need to seriously address, namely, the major abuse of alcohol by very young children. I know that is addressed in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill but I am appalled at the level of abuse of alcohol by young people and the ready availability of alcohol, in cans or bottles, in shops. It is a major problem.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on its initiative in further increasing tobacco prices. The issue of methadone maintenance is important but we <Col N="864" /> mentioned in the report that it might not be the most effective intervention. Some 300,000 drug users in Europe are on this form of treatment but it is only effective when backed up by other services such as counselling, training and so on. The key priority in future years must be to develop those services. An encouraging trend is the number of people on methadone who are finding employment. The most recent evaluation by the eastern regional health authority's treatment service, to which the Minister referred, found that in some treatment centres some 40% of those on methadone are now working. There are initiatives in communities like mine where such people are now able to go on training programmes and progress to employment. Arguably the stability that methadone has brought to their lives has allowed these people to seek out employment and hold down a job in much the same manner as any person on treatment for a long-term medical condition. This proves that, provided they receive treatment and other supports necessary to their well-being, drug users can effect a full recovery and return to a full and normal life.</P>
    <P>Many drug users in my constituency end up in Mountjoy. A vast number of them are young and, from visiting them, I know they are dragged into the drug culture there. I compliment the Minister for Justice on bringing forward proposals to have drug free areas in our prisons. It is necessary that the range of services available in the community are made available in prisons. There must be prevention so that drugs cannot be brought in, an awareness of the problem and an educational process so that when prisoners are discharged they can look forward to counselling, training and backup. My experience is that when they are discharged from prison they get back into the drug cycle. Very often when they come out of prison unfortunately they are more serious drug abusers than they were when they went to prison.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Wall I have a problem with the issue of cannabis. I believe it is a gateway drug. We should not move in the direction of legalising it although I do not mind having a debate on the matter. I remain to be convinced that we should legalise it. I was very impressed when we visited the Swiss project in St. Gallen where heroin is prescribed in very controlled and clinical conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not. It may well be possible to look at it as an intervention at some stage but we are far away from that now. We also mentioned setting up an independent body in the report. It was set up on an interim basis by Deputy Flood when he was Minister. I learned recently that the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, is bringing forward proposals for a national drugs advisory committee. These measures and others <Col N="865" /> such as further moneys for the Youth Services Fund and the expansion of models that have been proved to be successful in drug task force areas would be useful. I know there are areas outside of the drug task force areas that are in need of such interventions. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report which, without being prejudiced, is a good one and merits attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the report. However, as has been pointed out by the chairman of the committee it is dated January 1999. The work involved in putting it together took place in 1998 and the people who came before the committee did so in that year. It is a pity the time was not available before now to have even this limited debate on the report. However, as the chairman of the Committee on European Affairs has indicated, we are committed to continuing this work and hope to have a second report ready later this year. I hope that will be debated in the House at a more appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The report managed to escape the notice of the media. To the best of my knowledge there was not any reference to acknowledge that such reports are part of the more productive work of Members of this House. One journalist who specialises in assessing the work of Members of the Dáil admitted to me that he was not even aware of the existence of the report. That point is worth making because a great deal of valuable work is done by committees and, though it is for others to assess, I hope this report will be considered to be valuable.</P>
      <P>We have heard only positive contributions so far and I suppose somebody must be negative. Despite the time span since the committee discussed and agreed this report, its first and principal recommendation, accepted by the Government, has not been implemented. It is not difficult to implement it. Page 31 of the report refers to the independent expert or advisory group and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rapporteurs fully accept that any definitive report on specific aspects of the drugs problem is beyond the scope of the European Affairs Committee. Our role is primarily to assemble authoritative information, draw attention to deficiencies in the Irish response to the problem and raise issues which require a more informed approach. Clearly what makes our work all the more difficult is the glaring absence of any independent expert group in Ireland with the necessary expertise to provide an overview of the totality of the problem. Ireland appears to be the only EU country without such an independent advisory council. The establishment of such a group is an absolute priority if we are to develop a satisfactory policy response to the crises. Such an authoritative group could provide an informed and <Col N="866" /> objective voice on the specific aspects of the drugs issue as they arise. The present and previous Governments have committed themselves to the establishment of such a group but so far have not kept that commitment. The resulting vacuum can lead to self-styled experts representing no-one, and with no apparent expertise, portraying instead purely propagandist positions. This is most harmful to the proper understanding of the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The second report of the Ministerial Task Force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs in May 1997 recommended the establishment of an advisory body to conduct research into the causes, effects, trends, etc. of drug misuse and to evaluate the effectiveness of different models of treatment. We strongly advise, as a matter of urgency, that an independent expert body be established. This body could then work in co-operation with the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and Ireland might then make a more positive contribution to the development of a common European strategy on the issue.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who had responsibility for the drugs issue when we were drawing up the report. There is support for this proposal. I know the Government is actively involved but it has been actively involved in setting up this body for a considerable time. It is an urgent issue. It still has not been set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but it is painfully slow progress. I ask the Minister to speed up the process and implement it. I ask the Minister to ensure that when it is implemented it is a genuinely independent expert group with adequate representation from the voluntary community sector, in line with the spirit of partnership which has developed in response to the drugs crisis. The longer this drags on, the more urgent it becomes. Essential research is not being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same context, I wish to refer to the recently established Prisons Authority which has set up a steering committee on the drugs issue that has representatives of all the statutory agencies involved. So far, however, it has no representatives of the voluntary community sector. This is a serious omission. There should be no exceptions to the partnership approach. There is a vital <Col N="867" /> link between the community and prison and this must be represented on the steering committee. I ask the Minister to ensure this happens. For too long we have had the incredible situation of prisoners on treatment in prison getting temporary release and being unable to access treatment outside, with the inevitable consequences. Many of these prisoners' first port of call when they leave prison is a local community project. The community link must be represented on the steering committee and I ask that this is done.</P>
    <P>I thank those who participated or assisted in the production of this report, which, at the time of its publication, was a useful document and a mechanism whereby key personnel in the drugs area were able to highlight important aspects of the problem of concern to them. My biggest disappointment has been my inability to convince the Department of Education and Science that educational resources in disadvantaged areas are of the utmost importance if we are to respond adequately to the heroin crisis which stems from social exclusion. There is still no specific strategy to target additional educational resources into designated drugs task force areas, especially at primary level. On the many occasions I raised this issue with the former Minister for Education and Science I was unable to get the message through &ndash; perhaps it was a deficiency on my part.</P>
    <P>The only significant step taken in recent years was the introduction of the Breaking the Cycle scheme by the previous Government &ndash; this was introduced in far too few schools and only in junior classes. I do not have time to read into the record pages 23 to 25 of this report which deal briefly with social and educational disadvantage. I recently visited St. Joseph's national school in East Wall, in the north inner city drugs task force area, which is facing the loss of a teacher because the number of pupils has decreased slightly. As a result, some classes will have 37 children. This is in the docklands area where we are told there are great opportunities and there is a need for education and training. I hate being negative on this issue but when I see that, I think very little has changed. I ask the Minister to raise this at the special Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion which develops strategies to deal with social exclusion. If teachers continue to be taken from disadvantaged inner city schools like this, we will never resolve the problem of social exclusion or the heroin problem which stems from it.</P>
    <P>The current strategy on the drugs crisis began in the aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin, which was preceded by a series of gangland murders. Recent months have seen a similar and increasing series of gangland murders, to which Deputy Pat Carey referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and my colleagues for their participation in the debate. All Members referred to the concerns of those who have been afflicted by drugs and those who have been involved in the drugs issue. I will briefly deal with the Amsterdam and Swiss experiments which have been referred to by experts on all sides in the past few years. Both of these experiments unfortunately failed, the Swiss one on the basis that it was overly liberalised. It had to come to an end because it was abused and visitors converged on the area to participate and avail of the liberal regime which applied there. This was replaced by the St. Gallen experiment where the medical and educational authorities and the police took control, brought people into a programme and continued to give them a methadone type of treatment but with the hard drugs to which they were previously accustomed. This experiment is ongoing and the jury is still out. The Amsterdam experiment was the most liberalised and virtually everything was allowed. The jury came in on that a considerable time ago.</P>
      <P>Various methods will be identified as a means of attempting to deal with the problem. This means that innovative methodology will have to be used. This must be done as we have to try everything. Education in the context of prevention was referred to by numerous speakers. The purpose of educating the young is to get them away from reliance on drugs and point out the dangers. This is very difficult in areas of serious deprivation where the drugs scene is all around them. Peer pressure is greater when young people are involved in drugs. A young person needs considerable support to break away from this. There must be incentives to do this and I hope these are being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members also mentioned prevention and enforcement. This is undertaken by cutting off the supply as far as possible. There is an argument that liberalisation and legalisation will resolve the problem. This did not happen in the Swiss or Dutch experiments, the reverse was the case. We must think about eliminating as far as possible the operations of the racketeers and drug barons who have been operating here, with horrendous consequences, for many years. I compliment the gardaí and other agencies for their work which is effective now that some pressure has been brought to bear. As Deputy Carey said, recently there has been a spate of what appears to be tit-for-tat killings which is worrying, to say the least. Serious consideration must be given to air and sea surveillance because this country is noted for the ports and havens into which it is relatively easy to smuggle large consignments of <Col N="869" /> drugs. We must put more of an effort into this, especially since we have more coast to look after than any other EU country, with the exception of our neighbours, the UK.</P>
    <P>On the effectiveness of treatment programmes, we can only do our best with the resources, facilities and the most modern technology and ideas available. There should also be an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of any treatments &ndash; cold turkey, methadone or any other &ndash; to ensure they are up to date and effective.</P>

      <P>Portnablagh pier is situated amidst some of the most spectacular scenery in Ireland. The famous Sheephaven Bay stretches out in front of it with Horn Head standing sentry to the south and Muckish Mountain as the backdrop to the north.</P>
      <P>In recent years the pier has sadly fallen into a state of disrepair, like many other small piers along our coastline. The seriousness of its condition was recognised last year when renovation works were carried out. The project was not fully carried out, however, due to the grant being exhausted. At present the pier is in an unfinished state and is of no benefit whatsoever. It is simply unusable; it is as useful in its present unfinished state as a house without a roof.</P>
      <P>This presents very serious difficulties, not alone to local fishermen, who are completely dependent on this facility for their livelihoods, but to others, such as visitors and pleasure craft users, not to mention the Tory Island ferry, which uses the pier occasionally as a point of departure for the island. The major harbour development taking place in Tory Island has been serviced from Portnablagh. In its present unfinished state, it is impossible for the barge to use it this year.</P>
      <P>Portnablagh and Sheephaven Bay, near the holiday town of Dunfanaghy, have an international reputation as holiday destinations. Dunfanaghy, Portnablagh, Sheephaven, Horn Head, Shandon and Marble Hill are familiar place names to discerning tourists and visitors from Northern Ireland, Britain and further afield. The pier is the focus of aquatic activity but in its present state it is unusable. Significant improvements were made last year. Now an additional allocation to complete the project is needed. An allocation in the region of £50,000 would be sufficient to complete the restoration to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present activity cannot take place at Portnablagh pier due to the unfinished state of the renovation scheme. Access to the pier is impossible. Regular users, be they fishermen or holiday mak<Col N="870" /> ers, the Tory Island ferry or barge, have had to land and depart elsewhere along the coast. We are now entering the busy season as far as Portnablagh pier is concerned. Salmon and other fishermen are in a state of preparation. The tourism season has got off to a promising start. The pier, one of the most important facilities in the area, is beyond reach and it is a hindrance to water related activity in Dunfanaghy and Portnablagh.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister sanction this allocation as soon as possible so the pier can be restored and be of service and benefit to the local fishermen and others who have occasion to use it? All relevant documents and reports have already been submitted by Donegal County Council to the Department and all that is required is the nod from the Minister to give this project the green light to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to advise the House of the position in the development of fishery harbours and landing places nationally and in County Donegal in particular.</P>
      <P>The availability of safe, modern and efficient harbours, piers and landing places, together with facilities such as ice plants, is critically important for the future of the sea fishing and aquaculture industries. Without top class facilities of this kind, fishermen and fish farmers will not be able to deliver their product within the time scales or to the quality standards now demanded by markets. Infrastructural deficits around the coastline have to be tackled, therefore, in a way which will underpin the future growth and prosperity of the seafood sector generally.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to providing the necessary facilities and infrastructure for the sector. Under the national development plan £60 million will be spent over the period 2000 to 2006 on extending and improving berthage and onshore services. This expenditure will focus primarily on strategic fishing ports such as Killybegs. It will also take account of the needs of smaller harbours and landing places, many of which have an important role in the economic life of areas where alternative employment opportunities may be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can rest assured that fishery harbour development plans under the national development plan will take account of the importance of the fishing industry to County Donegal. A major project for the provision of a significant extension of berthage facilities at Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre, which will cost some £20 million, is in train, together with a programme of works to upgrade and improve the existing infrastructure at the harbour. In addition, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources announced last week that a major development programme costing £3 million, con<Col N="871" /> sisting of dredging works and the construction of a new quay wall, is being initiated at Greencastle. A major dredging project, costing £1 million, will also take place this year at Burtonport.</P>
    <P>This substantial programme of investment in these three key strategic fishery harbours is being complemented by the provision of financial assistance to Donegal County Council for works at smaller harbours and landing places. Assistance has been given to the local authority over the last year for works at 13 locations.</P>
    <P>Turning to Portnablagh, the pier there is owned by Donegal County Council. For this reason, it is primarily a matter for the local authority to determine what development or upgrading works should be carried out there. My Department's role is to determine, having regard to the available funding and the overall development requirements for fishery harbours generally, what financial assistance, if any, can be given for works which the local authority wishes to undertake.</P>
    <P>Donegal County Council sought assistance last year to carry out dredging works and the construction of a slipway at Portnablagh. Grant aid of £113,000 was paid to the local authority in respect of these works which cost £150,000. The local authority has now approached my Department for funding for additional works which it wishes to carry out there. These are the construction of retaining walls and the provision of a concrete deck adjacent to the new slipway, as well as the removal of rocks at the harbour entrance and repairs to the head of the pier. The county council has sought funding of £50,000 for these works.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that this request from Donegal County Council is being considered as a priority by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and that the Minister will respond to the local authority on the matter shortly.</P>

This investment provided the necessary reassurance that the breweries will continue to exist and prosper in the area. The holding company, Diageo, however, which owns and controls <Col N="872" /> the breweries, appears to be carrying out a programme of rationalisation which could see diminishing numbers employed in the brewing industry in Dundalk town.</P>
    <P>Despite falling unemployment figures in the town, the long-term unemployment statistics are still unacceptably high. If there were substantial job losses in this sector on the scale mentioned, it would seriously undermine confidence in the economy in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>It is unusual that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has responsibility for the brewing sector, although it is understandable in that the food industry and the drinks industry tend to be combined. One would have thought the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would have a stronger role in that sector.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, has come into the House to reply to this matter. I hope he will be able to provide some reassurance for the workforce.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. Guinness Group operations in Dundalk comprise two breweries, McArdle Moore which, in addition to its brewery function, is the sole packaging centre for Guinness in the Republic of Ireland and the Harp brewery, which brews Carlsberg and Harp.</P>
      <P>My Department is the regulatory authority for the drinks industry and beverages. Irish drinks and beverages are promoted in a big way by An Bord Bia throughout the world and they are successful in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>My information is that unions in Dundalk have agreed rationalisation plans for these two breweries which may lead to some voluntary redundancies, similar to other breweries in the group. In parallel with that rationalisation, I understand the Guinness Group is also currently reviewing its supply strategy across its brewing business in Ireland and the United Kingdom. I understand this involves its brewing and packaging plants.</P>
      <P>I further understand that in the rationalisation negotiations concerning the Dundalk plants, the unions were fully apprised of the broader review that is taking place across the organisation. While the outcome of the broader review will not be known for some months, it may involve reallocation of products and consequential closures. My Department, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Dundalk rationalisation already agreed is on a voluntary basis, I accept that the loss of employment is never palatable. Nevertheless, the recently announced expansion in Heinz creating 60 jobs and the greenfield investment by Kozy Shack down the road in Castleblayney to <Col N="873" /> create a further 75 jobs should help to soften the impact that these voluntary redundancies will have on the local economy. Those were positive announcements and it is welcome that an American investor will invest in the area. The Deputy will also be aware that the Xerox investment in Dundalk will create 1,000 job opportunities by the end of this year and a further 1,000 shortly afterwards.</P>

      <P>While the matter I raise is one of the utmost seriousness, we should try to deal with it in a calm and rational manner and without causing unnecessary alarm to members of the public. It is also a matter that raises serious questions about the future course of waste management and makes it imperative for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to spell out exactly the Government's position on incineration as a method of waste disposal.</P>
      <P>Anyone who is interested in environmental or health matters has known for a very long time that dioxin is one of the most toxic chemicals known, capable of doing enormous damage to the environment and causing lethal health problems for those exposed to excessive doses.</P>
      <P>Dioxin probably first came to attention as a component of Agent Orange, a herbicide used by US forces in Vietnam. Some 30 years on that country is still trying to recover from the lethal impact of that chemical. Many may remember the terrible damage done in the Italian town of Seveso when an explosion led to a huge discharge of dioxins. People have long been aware of the ill effects of dioxins. Even low level exposure is known to interfere with the immune, reproductive and endocrine systems. Dioxins also affect the early growth and development of humans and animals.</P>
      <P>Additional alarm has been caused by the draft report of the US Environmental Protection Agency which found that the cancer risk from dioxins is far higher than had previously been estimated. The report found that in regard to the United States, for the small segment of the population who eat large amounts of fatty foods such as meats and dairy products that are relatively high in dioxins the odds of developing cancer could be as high as one in a hundred. That estimate places the risk ten times higher than the US EPA's previous estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmentalists now claim, on the basis of the US EPA's report, that as many as 100 of the approximately 1,400 cancer deaths each day in the US are attributable to dioxins. The report also linked low grade exposure to dioxins to a <Col N="874" /> wide array of other health problems, including changes in hormone levels as well as development defects in babies and children.</P>
    <P>While the levels of dioxins present in our environmental chain are relatively low by international standards, we have a high level of consumption of meat and dairy products, which are the biggest carriers of dioxins. Irish children have a high level of consumption of dairy products. For this reason alone, it would be very unwise for us not to take urgent note of the US EPA's findings.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the US EPA's report, it is absolutely essential that we not only take measures to ensure that there is no increase in dioxin levels here but that procedures are put in place to reduce and eventually eliminate them totally from the environment.</P>
    <P>The US EPA's report will cause particular alarm to those who live in areas close to the location of the proposed large-scale municipal incinerators, given the established link between incineration and dioxins. While I am aware that improved standards and better monitoring procedures have led to reduced dioxin emissions from incinerators, the findings of this report cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must say exactly what the Government's position is on incineration. He has been in office for almost three years and I have yet to hear him spell out his position on this matter. It is not good enough for him simply to dump this problem on to the lap of local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency. Does the Government support incineration? The Minister should indicate clearly the Government's position on incineration in light of the US EPA's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time with me. The US EPA report shows beyond doubt that dioxin is a deadly substance. It is ten times deadlier than we thought previously. To proceed with the national waste strategy with which the Government wishes to proceed would be an act of criminal negligence. How many people have to die as a consequence of incineration before the Government wakes up to the fact that incineration is not the way forward? Can Ministers live with the deaths of so many people as a consequence of incineration? We know that it affects people within a 40 mile radius, it goes into the food chain, that people who consume those food products will die as a consequence of dioxins in food and that it is a deadly substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can commit to my constituents that the incinerator proposed for Ringsend will not go ahead. Industry wants such an incinerator, but the Green Party does not want it. Does the Government want an incinerator in Ringsend because according to the Minister for the Environment and <Col N="875" /> Local Government incineration is the way forward in this area?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Gilmore and Gormley for raising this important issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, cannot be in the House to respond to this matter and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be prepared to take a definitive position and make categorical statements on the strength of Irish press and TV reports, themselves based on an article in a US newspaper referring to a leaked draft report being prepared by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The rush to analysis on that basis is, in my view, irresponsible and unhelpful. I strongly doubt that the Deputy has seen or read the draft report referred to.</P>
      <P>I understand that the report, possibly amended, will be officially published next month. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will then evaluate it and the Minister will in due course be in a position to respond definitively in relation to issues arising.</P>
      <P>The information which is said to emerge from this leaked report should not come as a surprise to anyone who has attempted to keep abreast of the factual position regarding dioxins or waste incineration. For instance, equivalent information is contained in a comprehensive published 1999 EU report, Compilation of EU Dioxin Exposure and Health Data.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that dioxins are persistent and toxic in the environment. The essential point emerging from the original American article on this leak is that the US EPA has concluded for the first time that dioxins are a human carcinogen. In 1997, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, had already classed the most toxic dioxin compound as a known human carcinogen.</P>
      <P>Due to particular dietary habits, or occupational exposure, some sectors of a population may face a relatively higher exposure to dioxins than others. Press reports suggested that the US EPA has concluded that for a small segment of the American population, who eat large amounts of fatty foods that are relatively high in dioxins, the risk of developing cancer is ten times higher than previously projected. There are so many qualifications associated with this statement that comments, out of context of the report and the data involved, and without knowing what assumptions the US EPA had previously made, are of very questionable value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the question of exposure levels and relative risk goes to the heart of the issue regarding dioxins. The World Health Organisation considers that there is a level of exposure to dioxins <Col N="876" /> below which cancer risk would be negligible and, in 1998, it agreed on a tolerable daily intake of dioxins. The fact is that dioxins are ubiquitous in the environment. We encounter them every day, at very low levels. Combustion sources include domestic fires, motor vehicles and cigarettes, as well as incineration and metal industries. Clearly because of the potential toxic effects of exposure to dioxins, their emission must, where possible, be strictly controlled and minimised to ensure that exposure does not exceed relevant guidelines and standards.</P>
    <P>The information available to me is that modern thermal treatment technology enables the destruction of most dioxins in waste, and means that remaining emissions are minimal and can be tightly controlled.  The EPA here already applies a flue gas emission limit value for dioxins of one ten thousand millionth of a gram per cubic metre of gas emitted. This is an extremely stringent standard, taking the precautionary principle into account, and it will shortly be adopted by the EU generally. The available evidence indicates that these standards work. A 1995 EPA survey found no statistically significant variation in dioxin levels near existing incineration facilities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am advised that emissions from proposed new thermal treatment facilities, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, should not have any appreciable environmental impact or contribute significantly to background levels of dioxins locally or nationally.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the application for funding of Loreto Bray community sports project with the Minister. This project will be of enormous benefit to the town of Bray and its hinterland. It will make a real and lasting difference to the lives of young people in a town where the development of such facilities is not keeping pace with the growth in population.</P>
      <P>Bray is the eighth largest town in Ireland. It is a designated disadvantaged area. The population is still growing, particularly its child population, and yet it does not have any muli-purpose astra-turf facility. This is the first real chance the town of Bray has to provide such a quality facility. The project is a community driven initiative. It will serve not only Bray but the Wicklow region where no such facility exists. It includes a multi-purpose astra-turf pitch, floodlights, changing rooms and is located centrally in the town on the Loreto campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed feasibility study has been undertaken and costings estimated. The local contribution is £140,000 which has already been arranged. The grant being sought is £560,000 or 80% of the cost. The Loreto Bray community <Col N="877" /> sports project is representative of a range of local community groups who have a well established track record of achievement. They pursue policies of social inclusion to community integration. They include sports organisations, education establishments and Traveller and disability groups. They aim to promote integration through sport and recreation and to increase standards of sporting ability, to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population for improved facilities, to increase through specific strategies, participation in sport and recreation, to provide for more certainty in scheduling games and training sessions and thereby lengthen the sporting year and to provide a centre for regional games.</P>
    <P>The case for investment in such a facility is overwhelming. Bray has a shortage of such facilities. This project is centrally located. It is close to special amenities. It has planning permission and car parking facilities. Its management structure is properly formed with responsibilities already defined, including that of a full-time project manager. All that is needed to make this project a reality is a recognition of its merits in concrete financial terms. If the Minister wanted a classic textbook example of a well thought out quality project that meets the needs of the community and social inclusion specification of his Department he need look no further than that of Loreto Bray community sports project.</P>
    <P>This application for a capital grant under the sports capital programme is one of many but I am confident that no other has a better case or a better formulation in terms of meeting ministerial requirements. Historically, County Wicklow has not done well under the two sports grants schemes. The review group report shows that Wicklow received the lowest allocations of grant aid. In 1999 County Wicklow did badly in that it received approximately one-eighth of the County Donegal allocation and one-eighth of the County Kildare allocation. In this instance nobody can possibly argue that County Wicklow did not provide acceptable projects. This project, offering a high class badly needed and multi-functional resource for an entire community fulfills all the right criteria. If funding is granted work will begin in July and should finish in March 2001. This is a project I would urge the Minister to sanction. It will be an investment that will show a return in transforming the sporting and recreational lives of the young people of Bray and of County Wicklow.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjourment as it gives me an opportunity to outline the position on the allocation of funding under the sports capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was advertised in early December 1999. It was neces<Col N="878" /> sary for all groups applying for funding to complete an application form and submit it to my Department by the closing date of 11 February 2000. Some 1,650 applications were received and acknowledged. Applications received under the programme including one in respect of Loreto Bray community sports project are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines issued with the application form, a copy of which was sent by my office to each Member in December.</P>
    <P>The criteria focus on the following factors: the extent to which the project in terms of growth targets will increase the level of active participation in sports, recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance; the extent to which the project in terms of growth targets will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, that is, does it comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; the financial viability of the project; in addition to lottery funding has the club-organisation sufficient funds or strong commitments to funding to complete the project within a realistic time frame; the level of local funding available; given realistic projections of income from the project the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio economic disadvantage in the area as defined by ADM's indicators and the current and planned level of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposal and the outcome of those consultations; the range of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas; the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facilities in relation to the club-organisation's existing facilities and the priorities for the individual sports as defined by the NGB.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that in the past grant allocation under the sports capital programme was made on a county basis <i>pro rata</i> of the population level of the county. I appreciate under the system some small counties were concerned at the level of funding they received under the sports capital programme. Accordingly, I recently announced that subject to the number, quality and merit of applications received from counties I have decided to set a minimum level of support for each county at £200,000. This enhancement to the scheme will encourage sporting organisations in the smaller counties to be innovative in the prep<Col N="879" /> aration of their plans for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>The assessment process is almost complete. I hope to announce the grant allocations under the sports capital programme for 2000 within the next <Col N="880" /> few weeks. Until such time as the assessment process has been completed and the allocation made I will not be in a position to add any further to this statement.</P>

      <QRef>[13757/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): My Department liaises with An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas in developing the market potential of the organic sector. An Bord Bia, which carries out ongoing work in relation to surveying, investigating and developing markets and potential markets for food, believes that the Irish organic sector has the potential to become a significant niche within the overall food market. An Bord Bia is currently preparing a report on the consumer demand for organic produce within Ireland. This study is being carried out in conjunction with An Bord Glas and will be completed in mid June.</P>
    <P>Very substantial work is also being done by Teagasc to support the development of the organic sector. A new research project on organic milk production commenced during 1999 at the Teagasc organic unit at Johnstown Castle in County Wexford. Teagasc also is carrying out research into systems for the production of organic cereals at the organic unit in Johnstown Castle. At present Teagasc have approximately 120 acres under conversion to organic status in Athenry which will serve as a demonstration farm. They intend using this facility for education and training purposes.</P>
    <P>My Department is providing support for the sector through the provision of funding in the national development plan and in the rural development plan for the period 2000-2006 which is being considered by the European Commission at present. Proposals for a new agri-environmental scheme modelled on the provisions of the current rural environmental protection scheme have been included in the rural development plan, and these proposals include continuing support for REPS participants who opt to enter organic farming. In addition, the Government has made a provision of £6 million in the national development plan for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the demand for organic produce outstrips supply, and I am satisfied that the level of demand in itself will ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector. I am concerned to build on the work already been done to ensure the integrity of Irish organic produce <Col N="882" /> and to ensure that there are adequate supplies to meet demand .I am confident that the work being done by Bord Glas, Bord Bia and Teagasc, the continuing supports available through REPS, and the proposals for continued funding for the sector which are included in the national development plan, provide a solid platform for the development of the organic sector. This area was the focus of a number of recommendations in the report of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee and these will be considered in the context of the comprehensive response to the report which I have promised.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Rural Development sets out a vision and a framework for the development of rural communities and marks a new approach and commitment by Government to rural development. One of the concerns is of course to diversify economically and to provide additional income and job creation opportunities in rural areas while cherishing the distinct features and culture of the countryside. To maintain viable rural communities we must exploit our natural advantages and potential to the full in the creation of more opportunities for enterprise both on and off farm.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy decided by Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure that the benefits of economic and social progress are distributed throughout rural areas; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development, and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the national rural development forum met for the first time. The forum was established to debate current issues, to review existing programmes and to identify suitable policy responses to rural problems. Among the topics discussed at the forum were the spatial spread of development, the transition to part-time farming especially for low-income smallholders, rural poverty, rural transport and planning permission for houses in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan is the vehicle for delivering the commitments in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on rural development with a commitment to public investment of £6.7 billion over the next seven years in actions which directly impact on rural areas. Many of the other investments proposed in the plan will also have indirect benefits for rural communities such as employment development, bet<Col N="883" /> ter roads, new housing and improved health services.</P>

      <P>Since most official agricultural and trade statistics do not separate organic products from conventional agricultural products, there are limited precise details or official data on production and consumption of organic products available. However, current estimates indicate that organic food products currently represent just under 1% of the total food sales in Ireland and that demand for organic food is increasing.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia is currently preparing a report on the consumer demand for organic produce within Ireland. This study is being carried out in conjunction with Bord Glas and will be completed in mid-June.</P>
      <P>Whilst no specific targets have been set for the production of organic food, I expect the demand for organically produced goods will continue to grow. The organic farming sector is a developing sector and is reacting to the demands for goods produced in an environmentally friendly fashion. I am confident that the continuing supports available through the rural environmental protection scheme and the proposals for continued funding for the sector which are included in the national development plan, together with the work being done by An Bord Glas, An Bord Bia and Teagasc, provide a solid platform for the development of the organic sector.

      <P>The percentage of land which is currently farmed organically in Ireland is 0.7% of the total land area which represents 30,500 hectares. There are currently 18,500 hectares under full organic status with almost 12,000 hectares undergoing conversion to organic symbol status. Some 1,000 farmers are registered with my Department as organic farmers.</P>
      <P>The growth of organic farming in Ireland is facilitated by supplementary measure 6 of the rural environment protection scheme which provides specifically for conversion and maintenance of organic practices. Farmers wishing to change to organic farming must undergo a conversion period of two years before they are allowed to sell under an organic label. During this period they have to farm in accordance with the organic standards. In general, during the conversion period, they are getting lower yields without benefiting from premium prices for their output. In order to compensate this loss, extra financial support is available under the rural environment protection scheme during the transitional period. A lesser rate of payment is then available once they have achieved full organic status and can sell under an organic label.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a new rural environmental protection scheme are included in my Department's draft rural development plan for the period 2000-2006 which was submitted to the EU Commission in December. These include continued support for organic farming on the same basis as before. Funding of over £1.5 billion is available for REPS over the period of the rural development plan and I hope that this funding will be fully taken up by organic farmers among others.</P>
      <P>In addition, the national development plan includes a provision of £6 million for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region. The objective will be to ensure a regular supply of high quality organic produce to the market by supporting the development of organic operators and marketing structures. The targets for the new scheme under the national development plan will be to encourage established commercial operators to develop organic lines in addition to their core business by providing aid towards equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that the demand for organic product outstrips supply, and I am satisfied that the level of demand in itself will ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector. I am concerned to build on the work already been done to ensure <Col N="885" /> the integrity of Irish organic produce and to ensure that there are adequate supplies to meet demand. I am confident that the continuing supports available through REPS and the proposals for continued funding for the sector which are included in the national development plan, together with the work being done by Bord Glas, Bord Bia and Teagasc, provide a solid platform for the development of the organic sector. The area was the focus of a number of recommendations in the report of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee and these will be considered in the context of the comprehensive response to the report which I have promised.</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that to respond to the increasingly competitive environment on the EU and world markets, further rationalisation in the dairy processing industry is essential. Both the report of the Agri Food 2010 Committee and the recent discussion paper prepared by ICOS share that viewpoint. While mergers of particular companies, including those referred to by the Deputy, may give rise to certain initial difficulties, this does not take away from the overall view that, in the long-term, the dairy sector will be best served by an industry structure which has the strength and capacity to match that of our major EU and third country competitors and meet the challenges which lie ahead.</P>
      <P>The process of rationalisation is well advanced amongst our competitors. In Holland two companies handle 85% of their country's output; in New Zealand two companies handle more than 90% while in Denmark one company handles 87% of its output.</P>

      <P>Certain ruminant intestines are used in this country for the production of outer casings used in the preparation of sausages and puddings. My Department has licensed 12 premises under the abattoirs (control of designated bovine offal) regulations, 1996, to <Col N="886" /> produce casings for human consumption from designated bovine offal, otherwise known as DBO. Under the terms of the licence, DBO used in the preparation of casings may be obtained only from premises approved or licensed by me under the existing meat hygiene legislation. This guarantees that the animals from which the DBO is harvested have passed ante and post mortem inspections by veterinary officers of my Department. Furthermore, the licence requires that there shall be suitable and adequate facilities available in the premises to store and handle the DBO. Complete separation between DBO and any other meat or offal must be ensured.</P>
      <P>To ensure full traceability of the product, the licence stipulates to whom the casings may be consigned or sold. The licensee is obliged to maintain, for a period of at least two years, records of the source of DBO used in the preparation of casings and the subsequent use or disposal of such DBO or casings.</P>

      <P>Sterling has been strong against the euro since the start of EMU on 1 January 1999. The UK is a major destination for exports of Irish agricultural products and the strength of sterling improves our competitiveness on that market. Our total agrifood exports to the UK were close to two billion pounds in 1999, including £463 million of meat and £314 million of dairy exports.</P>
      <P>While any improvement in our competitiveness is welcome, the impact of this type of currency fluctuation is limited by the nature of the contracts, based on long-term customer relationships, which increasingly dominate the food industry. For value added products in particular market share is determined by consumer preference on which currency fluctuations would only have a limited impact. In addition many of our larger food companies now limit their exposure to currency fluctuations by using appropriate hedging instruments.</P>
      <P>The benefit to our exports must be balanced against some increase in imported input costs, but this impact is likely to be relatively small. For example, Ireland imported £80 million of animal feeds from the UK in 1999. This was however offset by exports to the UK of animal feed worth £64 million.</P>

Under transitional arrangements the headage system as it has operated up to now will continue to apply in the year 2000.

Under the programme for prosperity and fairness my Department is committed to introducing a system which will protect the payment levels to the categories of farmers for whom disadvantaged areas payments are an important part of their total incomes.  The task force which was established under the PPF to formulate a new system have had a number of meetings and expect to be in a position to propose a new scheme shortly.  Details of the new scheme will have to be approved by the European Commission in the context of Ireland's Rural Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The retention period for the ewe premium scheme lasts for 100 days beginning on the closing date for the lodgement of applications. As the closing date for the scheme this year was 20 January 2000 the retention period lasted until 28 April 2000. Since hogget ewes which are at least one year old at the end of the retention period qualify for ewe premium it is generally accepted that the retention period cannot expire any earlier than towards the end of April each year. An earlier retention period would mean that some hogget ewes, born in the previous April, would not be eligible for the premium. The requirement for retention periods under the various EU livestock schemes during which animals applied on must be held and maintained by the applicant is an integral part of each scheme and is set out in EU regulations. The retention period under the ewe premium scheme serves to ensure that beneficiaries are genuine sheep producers who normally maintain sheep on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the retention period is set out in an EU Council regulation any variation would require <Col N="889" /> the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers and any such change would have to be proposed in the first instance by the European Commission.

The discussions centred on the ongoing trade between Ireland and Egypt, particularly Irish exports of beef and the potential to increase and develop the already excellent relationship between the two countries. In the course of my visit I also raised the question of the re-opening of the live cattle trade with Egypt and stressed the importance of this trade for Ireland which in 1995 accounted for some 174,000 live cattle exports.</P>
      <P>Egypt has become Ireland's largest market in the world for beef. Exports to Egypt increased from 38,000 tonnes in 1996 to approximately 150,000 tonnes last year amounting to 450,000 head in terms of live cattle equivalents. Exports were worth £220 million. Ireland also supplies dairy products to Egypt and there is considerable potential for this trade to increase also. I am determined that this significant trade with Egypt should be maintained and am pleased to report the continued high level of satisfaction on the part of the Egyptian authorities with the safety and quality standards of Irish food.

      <P>CSO figures for average agricultural land prices show a clear rising trend, while the total area of land sold has decreased, since the beginning of 1998. Between the first quarter of 1998 and the third quarter of 1999 the average price of agricultural land increased from £6,219 to £9,541 per hectare, an increase of 53%. Over the same period the total area sold for agricultural purposes, as recorded by the CSO, decreased by 49% from 2,436 hec<Col N="893" /> tares to 1,248 hectares. Thus the increases in price represent, at least to some extent, increasing scarcity of agricultural land being put up for sale.</P>
      <P>Increases in land prices can be seen in a number of other EU member states. According to Eurostat figures, between 1990 and 1998 agricultural land prices increased in real terms by 44% in Ireland, 28% in Denmark, 20% in the Netherlands and 119% in Northern Ireland. However, land prices in Ireland in 1998 were still less than those in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and England, and only 60% of the average price in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I note that the Agri-Food 2010 report highlighted the importance of improving land mobility among its many recommendations and findings. I am undertaking a round of consultations with the representative organisations on these findings and recommendations in the period ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Following the BSE crisis in 1996, the EU introduced a beef labelling system aimed at re-establishing stability in the beef market and allaying consumer concerns by providing full traceability of beef presented for sale in the European Union. For a number of technical reasons, relating mainly to the legal basis for the regulation and the state of readiness of cattle identification systems in the various member states, it has now been agreed that the 1997 regulation will be replaced by a new regulation to be implemented in two stages.</P>
      <P>The first stage, due to enter into force on 1 September 2000, will provide the consumer with information permitting the identification of the animal or group of animals from which the beef was derived; the approval number and country of the slaughterhouse; the approval number and country of the de-boning hall and the category of animal. The second stage, which will come into effect on 1 January 2002, will make it obligatory to indicate the member state or third country where the animal was born, fattened and slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> As the largest exporter of beef in the EU, which accounted for more than 140,000 tonnes of our beef last year compared with 70,000 tonnes in 1997, it is important for Ireland to be supportive of measures designed to provide consumers with assurances on traceability. At the same time I am, however, very much aware of the possibility that labelling regulations could become the basis for a further shift towards re-nationalisation of beef markets. It was for that very reason that I insisted that the new labelling regulation agreed at the last Council should include a declaration to the effect that the EU Commission will closely monitor the development of the beef trade in the light of the labelling regulations, particularly in relation to the position of exporting member states, such as Ireland, with a view to taking corrective action if necessary. Given this declaration, together with the fact that Irish beef is a premium quality product, I am satisfied that Irish producers will not be disadvantaged by these new labelling provisions.</P>

      <Quest>if, in light of the results of the trials by his Department and Teagasc on mechanical beef grading, he intends to extend this type of grading as a measure to improve the general quality and standards of Irish beef; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The trial on mechanical classification, the results of which I launched last week, involved a comprehensive examination of the ability of three machines to predict fat and conformation class based on the EUROP grid given to carcases by a panel of three classifiers and also to estimate meat yield.</P>
      <P>The trial showed that the machines were able to predict conformation and meat yield with a relatively high degree of accuracy, but they had a significantly lower accuracy level in the case of fat cover. In general, the conclusion can be drawn that mechanical classification has considerable potential but the machines tested did not achieve the level of accuracy set down by the European Commission in its initial draft regulation for the standards to be attained by these machines prior to their approval for use in the classification of carcasses. However, following representations by my Department, the Commission now proposes to allow for further trials prior to setting down precise standards which these machines must achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will continue to work with the developers of these machines to assess whether the inaccuracy can be improved and with the Commission to ensure the standards set down in EU regulations reflect the current state of the technology while at the same time ensuring that these systems are capable of accurately classifying <Col N="895" /> carcasses. However, it will not be possible for a mechanical classification system to replace the current system of manual classification until EU regulations have been amended to provide for the use of machines. For approval they must be capable of meeting the standards set down in these regulations. When these conditions are met, mechanical classification will provide the beef industry with an objective basis for graded pricing. However, pending the introduction of mechanical classification, it is open to the industry and individual processors to use the machines to underpin a graded pricing system based on the meat yield.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas, will continue to endeavour to exploit all opportunities for Irish agricultural produce in both EU and international markets.</P>
      <P>Specific provision has been made in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for an allocation of some £48 million to facilitate An Bord Bia in achieving its overall objective of increasing sales of Irish food and drink. Following on the report of the Food Industry Development Group, which highlighted the need for continuing attention to competitiveness and market orientation, and an internal strategic review of the work of An Bord Bia, the organisation will continue to develop its role and functions while focusing on activities in a number of key areas, namely, upgrading its information service to provide and disseminate leading edge information and analysis for the food industry; increasing the emphasis on developing the marketing capabilities of food companies; and assisting companies in targeting new markets and new market segments.</P>
      <P>An Bord Glas is responsible for the promotion and marketing of food horticultural produce on the home market and for non-food horticultural produce on the domestic and export markets. An Bord Glas in its Development Plan for 2000 &ndash; 2006 forecast that horticultural production will increase from £260 million to £300 million over the period. Exports of nursery stock in the same period are expected to grow from £8 million to £16 million. The board's activities to achieve this growth include an integrated promotion and marketing campaign geared towards maintaining and developing the position of Irish horticultural produce in the market place.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the excellent animal welfare work carried out by the DSPCA in Dublin city and county over many years.

Formal negotiations on the plan with the Commission are now well under way, though it is not possible to indicate at this stage when the Commission will be in a position to approve it. When the plan is approved, my objective is to secure the earliest implementation of each measure including REPS.

      <P>Some increase in the basic rate of payment is proposed where smaller farms are involved. It is also hoped to secure European Commission agreement to arrangements which would allow farmers with a small area of land in an environmentally sensitive target area to secure REPS payments for those lands while not having to put their non-target lands in REPS. The objective of this proposal is to maximise the area of environmentally sensitive land farmed to the REPS specification. Some smaller changes to certain supplementary measures are also envisaged.</P>

      <P>The slaughter premium introduced under Agenda 2000 is payable on all bovine animals, including cows, heifers, bulls and steers aged eight months and older, slaughtered in local abattoirs or licensed meat export premises within the EU or exported live to third countries in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The premium is payable to producers of bovine animals who are registered herdowners and who held the animals slaughtered or exported live to a third country for a minimum of two months and where those animals were slaughtered within one month or exported live to a third country within two months of leaving the producers herd.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that application forms are not required for animals slaughtered within the State or exported live to third countries. This information is captured on the Department's database, the &ldquo;Cattle Movement Monitoring System&rdquo; (CMMS). The slaughter premium programmes process this information in conjunction with information held on several other databases such as the special beef premium, suckler cow, cattle headage, animal location file and calf birth registration system to determine the eligibility of these animals for premium. Payment will issue automatically where these animals are deemed to have met all the requirements of the slaughter premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Full processing of slaughterings and live exports has not yet commenced since all elements of the processing programmes are not yet in place. The input of historical data to the CMMS is also ongoing. It is expected that these requirements will be in place by the end of June at which point all animals slaughtered or exported live to a third country since 1 January 2000 will be processed using all elements of the new slaughter premium computer programmes. It is not possible at this stage to accurately predict what number of animals will be automatically found eligible and what number will be the subject of a query. Initial testing and some live processing would indicate a very high level of eligible animals.</P>
      <P>A producer's statement will issue to each herdowner within six-eight weeks detailing the premium status of animals slaughtered-exported. The statement will include a list of animals for which further information is required. In such instances the producer will be required to furnish evidence such as purchase-sales dockets, etc.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Commission regulation payments under this scheme will commence on 16 October 2000 at which time a 60% advance payment will be made. Payments will be made on a monthly basis after that date for that scheme year. A balancing payment will be made in 2001 as soon as the quota position is established.</P>

      <P>The European Union participates in the World Trade Organisation negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The mandate for the comprehensive round of negotiations which was to be launched by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle at the end of last year was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers on 27 September 1999 and confirmed subsequently by the General Affairs Council. In relation to access to world markets, the mandate provides that: the EU, as a major food exporter, must act with a view to sharing in the expansion of world trade which will result from the new round of negotiations; while the EU is prepared to negotiate a lowering of trade barriers in agriculture, it must also obtain, as a counterpart, improvements in market opportunities for its exporters; the Council is prepared to negotiate the process of reductions in export subsidies provided that all such support is treated on an equal basis; a discipline on the use of export credits must be introduced and appropriate solutions must be found to other less transparent forms of export support such as state trading and the provision of food aid.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has decided that with effect from 1 January 2001, all member states must engage in a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE. Their intention is to ensure that all member states, including those where no animals infected with BSE have been detected to date, engage in similar surveillance measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> In Ireland, a comprehensive range of BSE control and eradication measures operate, and these have been reviewed on numerous occasions by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission. Notwithstanding this, I have decided to initiate a targeted active surveillance programme in Ireland this year in order to further reinforce our existing controls and to give a clear signal to the Commission, to other member states and to third country markets of our firm intention to take every measure necessary to protect public health and to eradicate the disease.</P>
    <P>My Department will, therefore, commence a pilot scheme of surveillance in the very near future to identify and iron out any logistical difficulties arising. My intention is to launch the full programme of testing following completion of the pilot programme.</P>

    <P>The decline in export slaughterings is due to a fall in supplies of cattle arising from a combination of a 5% reduction in the national herd and increased live exports in recent years. The outlook for 2000 is for a 7% fall in beef exports, mainly to third countries, with a small increase in exports to the EU. The fall in beef exports, however, should be off-set to some extent by an increase in live exports.</P>

    <P>As can be seen from the table, exports of live cattle have increased significantly in recent years. This increase has been driven predominantly by a high demand for calves and weanlings from continental European counties coupled with the increased availability of suitable stock in Ireland and the approval of additional shipping facilities for their export from Ireland. The demand comes mainly from Spanish and Italian fatteners and in the case of adult cattle from the Lebanon.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department have become increasingly involved in participating in information meetings and seminars, in conjunction with the farming organisations, to improve farmer awareness and understanding of scheme requirements. This process will be continued and developed further as the remit of providing advisory, educational and training services to farmers is of particular importance.</P>
      <P>The recent Agenda 2000 seminars proved very successful, combining as they did the regulatory function of my Department and the advisory service of Teagasc. There was unprecedented attendance at each seminar, and the resulting feedback was very positive. It is my intention to make such seminars an annual event and to explore the possibility of Teagasc taking an even more active role in advising farmers in relation to scheme requirements. Teagasc is now also placing a strong emphasis on the education and dissemination of information to farmers on breeding, feeding, husbandry and general farm management practices in these areas and is doing this very effectively through displays, demonstrations and seminars during open days on the subject such as the recent very successful one held at the Teagasc centre in Grange.</P>

In addition, in the context of preparing for the 2000 area aid scheme, officials of the area aid unit have met Teagasc advisers and other consultants with a view to appraising them of the area aid scheme requirements for the year 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to animal casings when he refers to ruminant intestines. In this regard, imports of animal casings as an agricultural product have taken place for further processing, primarily for the export markets. Imported processed food products may also contain animal casings. Imported animal casings have come from Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Norway, Syria and Turkey.</P>
      <P>The controls in this area operated by my Department are based on EU harmonised rules governing the veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra-Community and third country trade in live animals and animal products. These rules require a range of checks to be carried out and also provide for the imposition of restrictions on, or the banning of, trade in particular animal products when this is considered necessary for the protection of public health. Last year's dioxin scare is a case in point, where trade in a wide range of animal products from Belgium, including those containing animal casings, was banned.</P>
      <P>The Standing Veterinary Committee of the European Commission, in which experts from my Department participate, constantly monitors events, such as disease outbreaks, in member states and third countries which are likely to have implications for public health. No restrictions on trade have been imposed in relation to animal casings.</P>
      <P>At present EU harmonised rules require: advance notification to my Department of animal product imports; that the goods must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate or, in certain cases, a commercial document; that the goods must come from an approved establishment, for example, a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and that the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imported agricultural products are sampled and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that they do not constitute a danger to public health. Third countries' imports are subject to a docu<Col N="904" /> mentary, identity and physical check while goods coming from other member states are subject to random checks. Goods which are not in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and, if necessary, destroyed.</P>
    <P>The framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised EU rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risks provided for under the aegis of Standing Veterinary Committee, are intended to provide assurance that imported animal products are fit for human consumption while allowing member states to fulfil their trade obligations as members of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.</P>

      <P>The funding of current projects under the Leader II programme continues in operation and is scheduled to conclude in the period July to December of this year in accordance with the particular business plans of the Leader groups.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the likely time period needed by the European Commission for finalisation and adoption of the guidelines pertaining to its new rural development initiative, Leader+, and the preparation and commencement of new Leader programmes, I secured interim administrative funding for Leader groups to 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>Following a lengthy period of consultation involving member states and including the European Parliament, the European Commission has recently adopted the guidelines for Leader+. The guidelines outline the template for the drafting by member states of operational programmes to be submitted to the Commission for approval and clearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines provide for three main actions, involving integrated territorial strategies of a pilot nature, support for co-operation between rural territories and networking of development activity. In regard to pilot strategies, groups will be expected to operate under priority themes with special emphasis given to approaches enhancing employment opportunities for women and young people. Also, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision is made for an area based mainstream Leader-type programme which will complement the Leader+ programme. This requires the drafting and for<Col N="905" /> warding of a separate operational programme for Commission approval.</P>
    <P>The total Leader funding for the period 2000-2006 is in excess of £110 million. The funding is more or less equally divided between Leader+, where £35.4 million is provided by the European Commission, and the mainstream Leader-type measure. The overall allocation can be compared to £98 million allocated to the Leader II programme.</P>
    <P>Consultation with relevant parties is a key element in preparing the draft operational programmes and a significant degree of consultation has already taken place. The consultative process is being accelerated and a number of advisory seminars are also being arranged on a regional basis to provide information to prospective Leader groups.</P>
    <P>Now that the guidelines for Leader+ are in place, I am concerned to ensure that the draft operational programmes for Leader+ and mainstream Leader are finalised quickly and forwarded to the Commission with a view to obtaining clearance and the prompt establishment of Leader funding activity to 2006. The European Commission procedure provides for a period of months for formal negotiation and clearance of programmes and I will be pressing for acceptance of our programmes at the earliest time possible.</P>

    <P>In general, there is no reason to be dissatisfied with the level of support and attention which Irish victims of crime receive from police in Spain. As in the case of all police forces, the service provided by the police there can occasionally fall short of the ideal. If an Irish victim of crime is not happy with the way his or her case has been handled it is open to him or her to lodge a complaint with a local magistrate or to initiate legal proceedings. The Irish Embassy and consulates give as much practical assistance as they can in such situations by liaising with the Spanish auth<Col N="908" /> orities, providing information to citizens on their entitlements and by giving them names of lawyers able to transact business in English.</P>

Rather it includes a link with promotional semi-State agencies such as Bord Fáilte and Enterprise Ireland <i>via</i> the Ask-Ireland website.</P>
      <P>The links on the site are to other Government Departments and State agencies and, given the Department's brief of promoting awareness overseas of Ireland, the site also has links to some of the national media. The Department recognises the need to develop the website further in order to extend and improve wherever possible the delivery of services <i>via</i> e-government.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Bus Átha Cliath that approximately 30 low floor buses, which are accessible to disabled or mobility impaired people, are in operation on its network. The company has purchased 25 of these over the past three years while the remainder are on trial. The bulk of the costs of purchasing these buses has been funded by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As already announced in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, all buses purchased by CIE from this year onwards for use on urban services will be low floor. Under the plan a further 225 accessible buses are due for delivery to Bus Átha Cliath this year. These will be delivered from August onwards.</P>
      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to disabled or mobility impaired people within the overall resources available to them.</P>

      <P>The main grant payment schemes operated by my Department are funded through the EU Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Many of the schemes are demand-led, that is, the amount paid out depends on the number of applications made during the year. Consequently it is not possible at this stage to say what the outturn for this year will be. However, the total amount paid to individuals and to companies by my Department from the Guidance and Guarantee Fund in 1999 exceeded £1.4 billion. I expect that total payments this year will be of a similar order.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 144,000 farmers and 2,000 traders in the country who may be eligible to apply for payment under the Department's schemes.</P>

      <P>Under the agreement on Agenda 2000 I secured an additional 150,000 tonnes, 32 million gallons approximately, of milk quota for Ireland and 20.5 million gallons of this is available with effect from 1 April 2000. Some 15 million gallons of this additional quota will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons. Approximately 21,600 active milk producers will benefit from this allocation and this means that almost 80% of producers with a milk quota of less than 55,000 gallons are eligible.</P>
      <P>A further five million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers with quota of less than 35,000 gallons who satisfy certain conditions. My Department has received approximately 3,500 applications under this scheme. These applications are being examined in my Department at present with a view to establishing eligibility and, therefore, it is not possible at this stage to say how many of these will be eligible for an allocation.</P>

      <P>The development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry is generally the responsibility of the Irish Horse Board which has since its formation in 1993 been implementing a strategic development plan for the sport horse sector. In co-operation with the board my Department has been providing a wide range of horse breeding improvement grants from Structural Funds over that period which have been focused on quality to encourage farmers to breed marketable non-thoroughbreds including Irish draughts, sport horses, Connemara and other ponies. Funds have also been provided for the marketing and promotion of such horses and the horse board operates an inward buyer programme with the aid of financial assistance from my Department to encourage people to come to Ireland to purchase Irish horses.</P>
      <P>The development of the thoroughbred horse industry is generally the responsibility of the Irish Horseracing Authority, IHA, and funds have been provided by my Department to assist the IHA's subsidiary &ndash; Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, ITM &ndash; in this area to promote the Irish thoroughbred horse and the export of these horses. ITM has been extremely active and successful in this role in recent years. 1999 saw total public sales of thoroughbred horses increase by 17% over 1998 from £59 million to £69 million. ITM also operates an inward buyer programme for the thoroughbred horse sales and markets the horses in traditional as well as new and potential markets. I have, after consultation with the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, included in the national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006 further initiatives to assist in the development of the thoroughbred as well as the non-thoroughbred horse breeding and production sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Horse Register, which is maintained by the Irish Horse Board, shows that the number of mares that were active and the number of foals bred over the last few years has remained fairly <Col N="917" /> constant following a peak achieved in the mid 1990s. The concentration of effort now is on increasing quality and marketability.</P>
    <P>The equivalent figures for thoroughbreds registered with Weatherbys Ireland have shown increases of between 15% and 25% over the last five years.</P>

      <P>The past three years have been particularly successful in terms of exports of food and drink, culminating in a 3% increase in 1999, when export earnings totalled £5.2 billion. This success is attributable in no small way to the marketing strategies of the industry and of An Bord Bia in pursuit of its overall objective to increase the sales of Irish food and drink.</P>
      <P>These marketing strategies have been tailored to meet the needs of the increasingly competitive marketplace. In 1997, for example, the focus was on beef marketing in the wake of the BSE crisis. The board's first overseas consumer advertising campaign for beef in co-operation with Italian buyers took place in 1997 and successful nationwide campaigns resulted in an increase of 7% over the previous year on sales on the home market.</P>
      <P>For the first time, in 1998 export earnings exceeded the £5 billion mark, due mainly to the success of the prepared consumer foods sector. An Bord Bia focused on the key market segments with the most potential for Irish produce, namely contract catering, wholesaling, pubs and restaurants.</P>
      <P>Last year was seen as an important year for Irish beef suppliers to rebuild European sales and this strategy was reflected in a volume increase of 8% overall. The World Meat Congress was hosted for the first time ever in Ireland in May and gave the opportunity to convey positive images of the Irish meat industry through the international trade press with more than 600 delegates and 70 journalists attending.</P>
      <P>The Irish food industry has achieved significant success in the past three years and the effect of the marketing programmes initiated and supported by An Bord Bia can best be summarised in the following results. Irish food and drink exports exceeded £5 billion in 1998, accounting for 13% of total exports; 80% of the top Irish owned exporters are food and drinks companies; and food and drink companies provide 20% of industrial employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent comprehensive examination of slaughtering capacity in the beef export plants, which was carried out by McKinsey consultants in 1997, indicated that the industry had an active slaughtering capacity in 1997 of the order of 70,000 cattle per week. This is in excess of the capacity needed to accommodate likely peak slaughterings in the foreseeable future. I share the view expressed by Mc Kinsey and subsequently endorsed by the beef task force and the agri-food 2010 committee that the removal of excess slaughtering capacity would both improve the profitability of the industry through lower unit costs and enhance its ability to compete on the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that the agri-food 2010 report recognised that removal of all of excess capacity is unlikely because of seasonal or regional patterns of production, that the realistic scope for Government action is limited and that responsibility for dealing with this issue rests primarily with the shareholders in the industry. Nevertheless, the Government does have a role in this area and, in order to secure a better industry structure, it has decided in the context of the national development plan to give priority to the beef sector at primary slaughtering and processing level. An operational programme to give effect to this decision is under preparation. This initiative, operating in partnership with the indus<Col N="920" /> try itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way.</P>
    <P>As far as the pigmeat sector is concerned, pigmeat slaughtering capacity is currently the subject of a joint North-South consultancy study. The study which will address the issue in some detail has been organised by Enterprise Ireland in co-operation with the INI Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland and my own Department. It is expected that the report on this study will be completed by the end of July.</P>
    <P>As regards sheepmeat, current estimates are that slaughtering capacity in this sector is approximately 120,000 head per week, which is close to the peak seasonal requirement.</P>

It is a condition of the scheme that <Col N="922" /> participants must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old-age pension. This condition also applies to participants' partners in a joint management application. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this condition when they join, and they are required to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old-age pension.</P>
      <P>The reason an overpayment occurred in this case was that my Department was not made aware of the position until several months after the husband of the person named became eligible for a national old-age pension. My Department is obliged to recover all overpayments under the scheme, which is 75% funded by the European Union. However, my Department is conscious that the repayments may be onerous and it is for that reason that they have been spread over 24 months whereas the overpayment itself took place over a much shorter period. As it is, the overpayment referred to will not be recovered until the end of January 2002 whereas the person named will be eligible to apply for an old age pension in February 2001. If she becomes entitled to the old age pension, the offset of both old age pensions against the early retirement pension will greatly reduce the scope for recovery of the overpayment from the balance of the pension under the early retirement scheme. For that reason, my Department sees no scope for spreading the recovery of the overpayments over a longer period without jeopardising its obligations with regard to EU funds.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a completed inheritance tax return has been submitted by the solicitor acting for the beneficiary, in which liability has been assessed in an amount of £7,361. The Commissioners have no power to mitigate the amount due. An amount of £5,000 was paid on 3 April 2000 leaving a balance outstanding of £2,361.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are willing to accept payment of the outstanding balance under an instalment arrangement. Normally, these payments would attract interest, but because of the circumstances of this case they are concessionally prepared to accept payment of any instalment without interest accruing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Alternatively, the commissioners are prepared to postpone collection of the unpaid tax, if the taxpayer is agreeable to the registration of a charge on the property inherited in favour of Revenue equal to the outstanding liability. Normally, interest would accrue on such a charge. However, if this option is availed of by the taxpayer, then it is proposed to waive the interest requirement.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes were merged into one new drugs payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July. A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and the drugs payment scheme. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme were <Col N="924" /> reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services &ndash; GMS &ndash; and the drugs payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes.</P>
      <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from criteria on the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. With regard to quinine, I should also say quinine sulphate is authorised for use in this country for the treatment of malaria and for no other indication.</P>
      <P>The list of drugs, medicines and appliances available to GMS patients, as specified in the current GMS code book, (including all updates) and with some additions, forms the common list of items for both the GMS and the new drugs payment scheme. I am satisfied that the common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies. This common list of items is of course subject to ongoing review and is amended on a monthly basis as new items are added to the list.</P>

      <P>Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of documents, including the health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, the report of the review group on the ambulance service and &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. The approach set out in these documents follows the internationally accepted principles of the chain of survival, which provides that effective care for cardiac emergencies requires early access to emergency care; early CPR; early defibrillation; and early advanced care.</P>
      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy clearly highlights the importance of patient-centred pre-hospital care involving not only the ambulance service but general practitioners, first responders and the public at large who all have a role to play in providing the right care at the right time. In line with this approach, services are being developed to provide an appropriate level of care in the community to deal with cardiac emergencies. My Department funds a bystander CPR training programme which is organised by the Irish Heart Foundation. This programme aims to increase the availability of CPR skills in the community.</P>
      <P>Defibrillation skills now form a part of basic training for all ambulance personnel. In line with developments in technology which now allow people to use defibrillators safely with less training than in the past, my Department is supporting a pilot first responder programme, which includes defibrillation skills. This project is being undertaken by the North Western Health Board. My Department has also supported initiatives to provide GPs in more remote rural areas with defibrillator and support equipment and training to allow them deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance. These schemes are all in line with the focus of the cardiovascular strategy which seeks to put a pre-hospital care network in place, based on the principles of the chain of survival. Further expansion of these initiatives will fall to be progressed in the further implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I have recently established the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council &ndash; PHECC. The area of training standards is a central part of the council's remit and the development of standards to underpin the effective diffusion of defibrillation skills will be a key area of the council's workload.</P>

      <P>A Government strategy on homelessness, Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, was launched by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, on 2 May 2000. The strategy, which has been approved and adopted by Government, is based on the report of the cross Department team on homelessness, which was established by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion to examine comprehensively the issue of homelessness.</P>
      <P>Part of the strategy is a plan by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, formerly the Eastern Health Board, for the co-ordinated delivery of a comprehensive range of health services to the adult homeless in its functional area. This includes the establishment of two multidisciplinary teams in Dublin, one in the north inner city and one in the south inner city. The full revenue cost of implementing this plan is estimated at £3 million. My Department has allocated £0.7 million to the ERHA this year to enable implementation of the plan to be proceed.</P>

      <P>New vaccines to protect against Group C meningococcal disease can be introduced in this country only when the statutory licensing authority, the Irish Medicines Board, has granted the necessary authorisation. The Irish Medicines Board must of course satisfy itself that the product meets the requirements in relation to such issues as safety and efficacy before a product authorisation is granted. It is hoped that the first licence for such a vaccine will be granted in Ireland in the summer. A vaccination programme will begin as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is important that the programme for delivering the vaccine is effective and well-organised and at my Department's request, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a multi-disciplinary group to take the lead role in this regard. The vaccine will be incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme and will also be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme. Each health board has in turn established a regional implementation group, to include a project manager, to undertake detailed local planning for the vaccine's introduction. The Health Service Employers Agency is involved in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation about the involvement of general practitioners in the delivery of the vaccine.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not, as a matter of course, retained in my Department. I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to compile the information and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that additional revenue funding provided to services for older people has been increased significantly in recent years. In 1998, the additional amount provided by this Government was £7 million and in 1999 the figure was £16 million. This figure has risen to £23.6 million for 2000. When nursing home subventions are included, this investment will total nearly £30 million.</P>
      <P>Funding has been increased in a number of areas. There is £10.4 million for improved pay for home helps in 2000. An additional £0.08 million will be allocated this year to extend the scope of the service to cover more people or provide more hours for existing clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over £5 million was allocated for 2000 to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, increased demand for nursing home <Col N="931" /> subvention and the additional costs arising from higher dependency levels. The allocation for 2000 is approximately £38 million.</P>
    <P>Additional geriatricians, with support staff, have been approved to supply specialist-led services in acute hospitals, while psychiatry of old age services were also boosted. A total of 13 old age psychiatrist posts have now been approved where only four such posts were in place when this Government came to office.</P>
    <P>Funding of £0.08 million has been allocated in 2000 for additional nursing and para-medical supports. These supports should lead to a more acceptable locally based service for older people and a more efficient use of acute hospital beds.</P>
    <P>A total of £1 million in funding was provided to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to continue to provide day care services and to develop new ones. A total of £1 million was provided in 1999 to help carers by way of respite care, etc. An additional £1 million was also provided in 2000. This funding will be allocated through the health boards based on local needs. In 1999 the money was used to provide support through the employment of liaison officers and nurses and the provision of respite breaks.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will provide £208 million capital funding to services for older people in the period 2000-06 inclusive.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA.</P>
      <P>The amount of basic SWA payable is the difference between the person's means and the minimum weekly income prescribed in legislation for the household type in question. Increases in these prescribed amounts, and consequently in the payment rates, are announced in the budget each year. This year the payment rate for a single person increased by £4 per week and the payment rate for a couple increased by £7.80 per week.</P>
      <P>Under the SWA scheme people can receive assistance in the form of a basic payment, a supplement such as rent or mortgage or an exceptional needs payment, ENP.</P>
      <P>In the case of exceptional needs payments each case is considered individually and the level of payment is made accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of <Col N="933" /> the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The community welfare officers decide entitlement in individual cases using the legislation and guidelines issued from my Department. There is no cap on the total value of payments which can be made by health boards under the SWA scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses.</P>
      <P>These include the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse, the payment of a bereavement grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, I have introduced a number of important changes to improve these arrangements. These include: an enhanced bereavement grant of £500 in 1999; the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow(er's) contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant in budget 2000; and a number of additional measures in this year's Social Welfare Act to address the position where the six weeks after death payment was not made or was paid at a reduced amount.</P>
      <P>A person in receipt of a pre-retirement allowance receives an additional amount equal to the qualified adult allowance when their spouse was in receipt of a carer's allowance, old age non-contributory pension or blind persons pension. However, if the deceased spouse was in receipt of an unemployment or disability payment, invalidity pension, supplementary welfare allowance, pre-retirement allowance or unemployability supplement, the survivor does not receive any extra payment in addition to his or her own payment. The current arrangements will be reviewed in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Under the means test associated with the one-parent family payment &ndash;<Col N="934" /> OFP &ndash; a lone parent is allowed to earn up to £115.38 per week without affecting his-her payment. Earnings between £115.38 per week and £230.76 are assessed at 50%. Payment ceases when earnings exceed £230.76 per week though there are transitional arrangements in place whereby a lone parent who exceeds the upper income limit may retain 50% of his-her entitlement for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>The income disregards aim to encourage lone parents to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency and are also intended to recognise the particular difficulties and expenses which lone parents often face in participating in employment and training. The extent to which the income disregards are meeting their objectives is currently being examined as part of a review of the OFP under the Department's expenditure review programme. It is expected that this review will be completed in the next couple of months and changes to the OFP scheme will be considered in the light of the findings of the review group.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the pension arrangements which I introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act for those self-employed people who were 56 <Col N="935" /> years of age or over in April 1988, when social insurance was extended to the self-employed, and who failed to qualify for a pension as they did not satisfy the standard requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>From April 1999 a special old age contributory pension is available to those self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind this five-year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.</P>
      <P>I consider these arrangements to be a fair and sympathetic response to the predicament of some people who, through no fault of their own, could not qualify for a pension in accordance with the standard qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>To date 3,414 claims for the special reduced rate old age contributory pension for the self-employed have been awarded, at an annual cost of almost £11 million.</P>

Credited contributions may not be awarded, however, where the last paid contribution made by the person in question was in respect of self-employment, class S, regardless of the person's age or previous employment history.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the absence of class S credited contributions within the wider social insurance system can present difficulties in some cases.

      <P>Recommended guidelines for public sector organisations websites were prepared on foot of a recommendation in the action plan on the information society and were published late last year. The guidelines set out recommendations on such areas as the content, design and presentation, accessibility and bilingualism of websites. In addition, the guidelines make recommendations in relation to the provision of links to other websites. It is my intention that as far as possible the three websites which are managed by my Department will comply with the recommendations in the guidelines. Party political or commercial material is not included on any of my Department's websites.</P>

      <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation made by a person of full age is processed under section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended in 1986. This section provides that the Minister for Justice may, in his absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation where the statutory provisions are complied with. One of the conditions is that the applicant must have had five years residence in the State in the nine years preceding the application. Applications in respect of adult children of naturalised Irish persons are considered in their own right. Section 16(a) of the aforementioned Act, provides that the Minister, may, if he thinks fit, waive some or all of the statutory requirements in cases where the applicant is of Irish descent or association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the law already contains <Col N="939" /> a number of substantive measures to deal with drinking in public places.</P>
      <P>Section 33 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 makes it an offence for any person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol, whether in an on- or off-licence, or to consume it in any place other than a private residence.</P>
      <P>While the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, contains a wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of underage drinking the new Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000, which is currently before the Oireachtas, will strengthen the provisions regarding the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to underage persons.</P>
      <P>Offences created by the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, include intoxication in a public place, section 4, disorderly conduct in a public place, section 5, and threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place, section 6. The Act also gave gardaí important new powers to deal with persons committing such public order offences. Section 8 provides that a garda may, where a person is acting in a manner contrary to the relevant public order provisions of the Act or otherwise loitering in a way which causes apprehension for the safety of persons or property, direct that person to desist from such behaviour and to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. It is an offence for a person to fail to comply with such a direction.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions to which I have referred deal with the problem referred to by the Deputy and I have no proposals to introduce new legislative provisions to increase Garda powers in this area.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question I would invite the Deputy's attention to sections 111 to 114 of the Children Bill, 1999 which was recently referred to the Dáil Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for Committee Stage. Those sections provide for the payment of compensation by parents and their binding over by the court to exercise proper and adequate control over their children. They also provide the court with the power to make a parental supervision order when a child is found guilty of an offence and the court is satisfied that a wilful failure by the parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's criminal behaviour.</P>

      <P>My Department has operated a departmental website for approximately the past three years. Its content is broadly divided into four separate areas: &ldquo;static&rdquo; type information such as scope and responsibilities of the various divisions of my Department including descriptions of work areas in accordance with sections 15 and 16 of the Freedom of Information Act; current information such as press releases and speeches. In addition, this area is used as a discussion forum, e.g. for upcoming legislation, members of the public and interest groups can make contributions on the issue; reports published by my Department &ndash; it has been the policy of my Department to publish these reports in full wherever possible; and contact information including electronic mail addresses for all main divisions.</P>
      <P>Material is only placed on the site after going through the normal approval process for publication. Most of the material published on the site is also available in other media.</P>
      <P>With regard to guidelines to regulate the links included on the website, it has been the practice to include links to related sites such as other Government-public agencies, both at home and abroad, EU sites and relevant educational institutions etc. There are no links to either party political or commercial material. There is a link to a site called &ldquo;Doras&rdquo; which has rated various Irish websites, including most Government websites, with regard to content, etc. However, this was a free service with no payments involved and is, therefore, not deemed commercial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that my Department has recently commenced a project to upgrade the site. Part of the project will be to examine ways of automating the approval process so that publication of material is an integral part of the process of document preparation. This is to ensure that as much material as possible is published and it is done in a timely manner. The opportunity will also be taken to widen the links section and later to include direct interaction, where appropriate. The <Col N="941" /> project is an early and important step in the implementation of the electronic Government initiative for my Department.</P>

    <P>Resource teacher posts may be sanctioned on a full-time basis, either in a single school or in a cluster of schools, provided there are sufficient children with special educational needs arising from a disability to warrant such a post. Alterna<Col N="944" /> tively, part-time hours may be sanctioned to provide support teaching for individual children where there are insufficient children with special educational needs to warrant the allocation of a full-time or shared post.</P>
    <P>The number of resource teachers to be sanctioned by my Department in the 2000-01 school year will be determined by the number of pupils who are assessed as being in need of support and for whom schools apply for such support.</P>
    <P>In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were advised that they could seek remedial support where they could demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
    <P>All available posts were utilised in the current school year to ensure that no primary school in the country should be without a remedial teaching service. There are currently 40 remedial teachers in County Waterford.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the remedial needs of the schools in County Waterford will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the circumstances in which a third level student may apply for a higher education grant in their own right, where they have an income independent of their parents and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provide that the means to be taken into account for the purpose of assessing eligibility under the scheme are those of the student, if any, and of the parents or guardians of the student.</P>
      <P>The Acts make special provision for the assessment of means in the case of mature students. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. The statutory definition of a mature student is a person of not less than 23 years of age who has reached that age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parental income must, therefore, be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in cases where the student is not a mature student. The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students. I have previously indicated that <Col N="945" /> it is recognised that these provisions can give rise to difficulties in individual cases and that my Department is examining the issues involved.</P>

The family member is advised to have the form of declaration completed if it is not intended to take out probate or letters of administration. The declaration must be made before a peace commissioner, a notary public, a commissioner for oaths or a person authorised by law to receive and take statutory declarations.</P>
      <P>The claimant must list on the form of declaration the names, addresses, ages and relationship of the survivors of the deceased.
