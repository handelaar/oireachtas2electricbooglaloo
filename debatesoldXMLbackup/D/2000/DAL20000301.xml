      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Under Standing Order 31 I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss an urgent matter of public importance, namely, to allow the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement in the Dáil on the urgent measures he will take to deal with the increase of more than 3,000 patients on the hospital waiting lists to a total of more than 36,000, and the strategy he will put in place to end the appalling suffering of people on the waiting lists.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 18, Motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997, Regulations &ndash; Draft; No. 41, Social Welfare Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 4, National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 42, Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) to be taken not later than upon the conclusion of Private Members' business and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; No. 18 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 41, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m.; and the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 42, if not previously concluded, shall <Col N="882" /> be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. Private Members' business shall be No. 96, Motion re White Paper on the Defence Forces (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be willing to consider returning the Education (Welfare) Bill to this House to discuss it on Second Stage in principle given that there is evidence now of large-scale poaching of students between the ages of 16 and 18 from second level schools? They are being taken into employments and they are unable to work in school because of the work they are doing outside school hours. Many are being asked to leave school to take up employment which will result in an untrained workforce as a result of the overheating of our economy. This is a matter of great concern. In the long-term, our current prosperity could be doing damage to the trained ability of our young people because they are being given an incentive to leave school too early. Will the Taoiseach examine this matter in the context of the Education (Welfare) Bill which is currently before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is at Committee Stage. I am sure Deputy Bruton would accept that this is not a legislative matter but it is a matter of concern. I spoke on this issue at the Opportunities 2000 launch a few weeks ago. There is no doubt that this is happening. People are moving out of the education system into part-time jobs, and then those part-time jobs become full-time jobs. That is happening to a fairly large extent. The Minister for Education and Science is in a round of discussions with IBEC and is due to meet that body again shortly on this issue to see what we can do with the employers to discourage this practice. I will ask the Minister to keep the Deputy informed about what happens in those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government and the British Government have any plans, nearly three weeks after the suspension of the institutions in Northern Ireland, to convene a meeting of all of the parties to the Good Friday Agreement as requested by both the SDLP and the Alliance Party, to name but two? We are now facing, the week after next, the St. Patrick's Day celebrations across the world during which the issue of Northern Ireland will be discussed. It is absolutely essential that the sense of drift which is now manifest is halted and that some initiative of a concrete nature is taken by the two Governments. Will the Government indicate clearly the action it proposes to take to address this very serious issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="883" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very serious issue. A number of meetings are being held. The British Prime Minister will meet some of the party leaders today. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will also meet some of the parties today. We have a tentative plan to hold a number of meetings over the next fortnight. I would like to be able to tell the Deputy that the meetings are of a concrete nature but I cannot. However, there is contact.</P>
      <P>We must try to get some level of support for an initiative before we get involved in a round table session. There have already been round table sessions between the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, and the Minister, Deputy Cowen. We will arrange dates for further meetings but prior to that and before they can be of value we have to get a supportable and sustainable line of agreement with the parties. At this stage, people are still involved in recriminations which is a hopeless strategy and we are trying to move them away from it. After today and subject to the meetings that will take place in London and in Dublin, we will be able to outline what we will do next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the characteristic of the process that led to the Good Friday Agreement was a series of inclusive talks? We do not have that process any more. If the British and Irish Governments are not able to agree a strategy, will the Government seriously consider reconvening the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to enable all parties who wish to participate to do so, not to engage in recrimination but to engage in a more open and inclusive process that would unblock the current difficulties? We cannot allow this drift to continue through the St. Patrick's Day festivities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that recrimination is likely to continue as long as there is a perception among the parties that the two Governments, while willing to undertake many activities and full of goodwill, do not have an agreed plan on how to move forward? Will he agree that the urgent matter now is for the two Governments to agree on a strategy and to pursue it? The absence of an agreed strategy between the two Governments is creating the vacuum that is making space for the blame game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Governments have a strategy. I was talking to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, an hour ago and we have a clear strategy that we want the institutions up and running again, progress made on demilitarisation and progress on the arms issue&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We all want that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which will put the arms beyond question or beyond use. The difficulty is that the parties at this stage, as is evident from our bilateral discussions with them, are not in a position to make a substantive move. However, <Col N="884" /> there are meetings in London today with the Prime Minister, although it is not for me to say who he is meeting. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, is also meeting some of the parties &ndash; the main parties creating the obstacles &ndash; and we will see if any progress is made. We do not intend to allow a stalemate to develop without a series of meetings this side of St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that, as of now, the Government is not prepared to convene a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Government cannot do that on its own initiative. The parties must agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The parties have asked for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed it with some of the parties. It might come to that point but there are some other ideas we must try first. If it is going nowhere, however, I will consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The parties in this House are agreeable, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Women's Coalition are agreeable and we know or presume that other parties are well disposed to it. There is a substantial measure of agreement about reconvening the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea of getting the relevant parties around the same table. However, it is important that General de Chastelain be there too, so the undertakings he was given or not given or which were withdrawn or offered can be put on the table and people can be asked questions about them. It is only by getting down to brass tacks and having General de Chastelain present that real progress will be made on this issue. We must be realistic. The problem is not goodwill but unwillingness to make a particular decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome reconvening the forum as soon as possible to help the process. However, in its absence, can the Taoiseach confirm that there are many bilateral discussions taking place without media coverage? The lack of media coverage gives the appearance of inaction despite the quiet diplomacy that is going on. Will the Taoiseach reassure people that there are bilateral discussions even though we do not hear or read about them for obvious reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that type of contact is taking place. I do not wish to be too blunt about this, but in two separate weeks last year I spent about 100 hours each time having round table meetings which just kept going around the table. When I deem it useful to have a constructive meeting that is not full of recriminations and the blame game, I will be prepared to have it. However, I see no purpose in having a meeting for people to restate what I am listening to day <Col N="885" /> in and day out. I already know it, and it is not necessary for anybody else to have to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the Government has failed to run our health services properly? Will he indicate whether the Government plans to introduce legislation to speed up the recruitment procedures for consultants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to an issue relating to finance which the Minister of State is endeavouring to resolve with the European Commission. It is a hold up on finance from Europe which has gone on for a considerable time. It has created frustration and we want to resolve it as soon as possible. The Commission has come back to us on several occasions seeking additional information and we have again complied with its latest additional information request.</P>

It is important that any undertakings given in this matter should be fulfilled to the letter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very angry and disappointed the Minister is not present this morning because the budget did nothing for the poor in society. The Minister is acting like a general in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. He has issued a directive to his officials throughout the country to target the poor at any cost. He attacked the farmers and 1,100 people on farm assist lost money. I want the Minister of State present to convey a message. I know officials from the Department, some of whom are entering <Col N="891" /> the Chamber at present, receive a reward for removing the poor from social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from doing so. They are the people who run the country and that is the sad aspect to it. The Minister has issued a directive telling his officials to target the poor. Some 1,100 people lost money when they applied for farm assist. This was the great scheme the Minister announced would help the poor.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred yesterday to a new system operated by Department officials whereby people registered as not available for work are seen as not genuinely seeking it. Some 8,014 people were taken off social welfare payments between January and June last year. Twenty-six per cent of those who appealed that decision are in receipt of payments again. A category of people exists who are unemployable and who should be in receipt of disability benefit etc. The social welfare system is attacking such people.</P>
      <P>I noted from the Minister's recent report how proud he was to take money out of the pockets of poor people. That was a great achievement. Why does he not attack those who defrauded the State of money? The Government will not do that. The motto is to always attack the poor and the weak in society and keep them down. The people are unhappy with how they are being treated. I would not like to be the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, when he next goes canvassing. The people of the west are waiting; they are angry. There is nothing in the current budget for them. Why is this Government coming down so hard on the poor, the weak and the sick? People are being taken off social welfare benefits on a daily basis. The officials are operating the system in an arrogant manner and are being rewarded for doing so by those at the top. I would not wish to make money off the backs of the poor. It is sad that the system operates in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not afraid to speak out about what I am witnessing on a daily basis. A man came to see me last week at my clinic who had letters from three different companies stating they had no job vacancies. Yet he was taken off social welfare benefit. He is living in a rural area where there are no jobs. Something like that would not happen in the Third World or in Russia, during its worst times. That man will have to appeal the decision. We all know the reputation of the appeals system. As far as I am concerned the appeals officers and the Department are working together on this. We should appoint an ombuds<Col N="892" /> man for the poor who could adjudicate on matters related to the social welfare system. The current system is not working.</P>
    <P>Some of the increases announced in the budget will not come into effect until September 2000. Why did the Government not introduce such increases in next year's budget? It is outrageous that people should have to wait until September this year for these increases. That is an attack on the poor. Tax breaks for the rich announced in the budget will come into effect in April. Why can social welfare increases not be paid at the same time as the tax breaks are introduced? Why should the poor have to wait until September and the rich gain in April? That is wrong and we must do something about it.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the increase in child benefit. Families have never found living as hard. The spin doctors are being paid very well &ndash; if this Government is good at doing one thing, it is good are employing spin doctors. In some cases they are being paid more than politicians. They are being rewarded very highly for what they are spinning out. A number of Fianna Fáil back benchers had better watch out at the next election. The people on the ground will spin these spin doctors at them and show them what they think of this Government.</P>
    <P>A number of cases have been brought to my attention recently. In the case of couples, on the death of one of the partners who because of a disability, for instance, was entitled to the free scheme, the remaining partner, who is not of pension age, loses entitlement to that scheme. It is reasonable to request that the Department should continue to pay such people under that scheme for at least 12 months. People suffer terrible trauma on the death of a husband or wife. It would not cost the Department a fortune to do this.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme is outrageous. If we are lucky we might get 12 or 13 days a year of sunshine in Ireland. This scheme operates only from October to April. It should operate throughout the year because elderly people need to light a fire every week of the year. Such an improvement would be well received by the elderly who deserve more from us.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a good scheme but one should not be means tested for it. People over the qualifying means should receive some recognition for taking care of relatives at home, perhaps £50. The Department needs to be more generous. It is more costly for the State to look after a person in a nursing home. If a family member or relative is prepared to take care of the person at home the least the State can do is give them some recognition. The carer's allowance is not even of much benefit to those in receipt of social welfare payments. The measly increase is no good. The Minister should give top priority to this area. We should take care of the sick and elderly in society. It is wrong that those who care for sick or ageing relatives and who are saving the State a fortune should be treated in this way. The last place sick <Col N="893" /> or ageing people want to go is into a home. The Minister should take another look at that scheme because its rules and regulations are too severe.</P>
    <P>The Minister also needs to look at local authority rents. Different local authorities operate different schemes. The Government should bring all rents into line. A man who will receive a £3 or £4 increase as a result of the budget told me he will lose £2 of that to the local authority as a result of a rent review. He qualified, as a single man, last year for the medical card by £2. This year a couple can earn a further £1.50 and their entitlement to a medical care will not be affected. The Minister is not living in the real world. People in receipt of pensions should pay fixed rents of approximately £10 or £12 a week. They should not be means tested. They have contributed to society and should be taken care of in their latter years. There should be a common rent payment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the appeals system. I am unhappy about the length of time people have to wait for appeals.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that people have to wait six, seven and eight months for appeals and then a further month or two for a judgment on whether they will be left on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers have been badly treated by all Governments since the foundation of the State. It is wrong that lone parents are better looked after than widowers and widows. I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, to rectify this because he has responsibility for the elderly. Many widows and widowers have been left in poor circumstances. The system is against them and that is wrong, particularly when they have lost a loved one. I know many widows or widowers who have reared young families on poor incomes. Their good work and the challenges facing them have not been recognised. It is outrageous that they have suffered in our society.</P>

      <P>This is the most wide-ranging Social Welfare Bill in the history of the State. It delivers on key commitments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium and Partnership 2000. It exemplifies our commitment to an inclusive and caring society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill signals a dramatic re-evaluation of the method of assessing social welfare entitlements. New income supports have been put in place for <Col N="894" /> carers. New widowed parents grants, special pensions for those with pre-1953 social welfare insurance and a new and fairer method of assessing capital for social insurance purposes have been introduced. In future certain low paid employees will enjoy exemptions and there are improvements for those who move from social welfare to the many jobs currently available as a result of a strong and vibrant economy. Changes have also been introduced to the means assessment for farm assist and for fishermen on low incomes in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Those in need of social welfare in the early days of the State were left under no illusion as to their low status. Those administering the system took great pains to make them aware of their dependence on the State which doled out their meagre subsistence. Social welfare was used to ensure that people did not live in abject poverty and that they did not starve. It was a means of providing people with clothing and essential household goods so they could maintain a certain lifestyle. However, recipients were always made aware that they were beholden to the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The State was a self-righteous benefactor of those who could not afford to look after or feed themselves or their families. Those who administered the system were often more interested in correct book work and accountability than they were in the people who needed them. There was a judgmental aspect to the administration of social welfare which inflicted severe lifelong psychological damage on those in receipt of the paltry benefits. People will say times were different then and that people had different attitudes, values and needs, which is true. However, it is sad to think back to those times.</P>
    <P>The poor law unions and dispensaries are part of our history. Old people were put into the unions when their health declined and relatives were no longer able to care for them. There are few in this House who do not have sad memories of a relative or a friend of the family who was put into these unions because they had no other place to go. Visits were always a great source of distress and one always left the overcrowded wards with the pleas of people wanting to go home ringing in their ears. I am glad those days are long gone.</P>
    <P>I also remember tales of visits to public dispensaries where cough bottles and tablets were grudgingly doled out to those who had to suffer the Dickensian system. People who wanted a cure for a hacking cough often went home with a bottle of coloured liquid which did not seem to help. I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, remembers those days. It was a common belief at the time that the basic ingredient in those cough bottles was water. I am glad dispensaries are a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>Many people reared families of seven on the 30 shillings a week they got on the dole.</P>

      <P>Those who qualified for unemployment benefits were often forced to stand in long queues and to be subservient to those who stood on the other side of the counter. Those who had the temerity to ask questions were publicly reprimanded and humiliated by persons employed to serve, help and advise them. I am glad that attitude does not exist today. It has been confined to the graveyard of many of our past anti-social public service practices.</P>
      <P>I am in daily correspondence with officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who are helpful and co-operative. The aim of the Department is to help and serve the public. That is the Minister's approach to his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I recently visited the social welfare office in Cork where I met the manager and his staff. I was glad to see they had placed job advertisements in the office so people could apply for them. I congratulate Pat Cochrane and his staff for the excellent way they deal with the public.</P>
      <P>The increased budget allocation of £428 million is the largest to come before the House. The substantial reduction of £103 million in PRSI and health contribution levies for low paid employees is also welcome. Additional spending in the budget amounts to £531 million, which is more than double the figure of £228 million in last year's budget.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to support the recognition of the role of carers in the Bill. They are a first class dedicated group of people without whom our society could not function. They provide high levels of care at home to both old family members and neighbours, those who suffer disabilities and those who are terminally ill. Carers make it possible for those in care to avail of an improved quality of life in their homes. They are on call 24 hours a day and they give freely and unselfishly of their time and expertise.</P>
      <P>The work done by carers is often not fully appreciated or recognised. One of the reasons is that they blend into the family life of those for whom they care. They are seen as part of the family unit rather than as people who nurse or tend to the elderly or ill. Their commitment and availability means they are often taken for granted, but not by those for whom they care. Society does not always fully appreciate their vital and outstanding contribution to the welfare of those they help. I am glad the Minister shares my esteem and appreciation for carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the introduction of a new social insurance scheme for carers benefit. It will facilitate people who wish to leave the workforce on a temporary basis so they can care for older or disabled people in need of full-time care and attention. Separate related legislation will be introduced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, which will be <Col N="896" /> enacted to protect the employment rights of carers in receipt of carer's benefit. This benefit will be payable for up to 15 months in respect of the same care recipient. The Department will pay a weekly income support payment of £88.50. This will not be means tested as it is a social insurance benefit. It will be paid provided the relevant PRSI contribution conditions have been met. I am glad the role of the carer is now being given the recognition it fully deserves.</P>
    <P>The increase for old age pensioners embodied in this Bill means we are well on the way to delivering on our commitment to increase the pension to £100 over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, we are ahead of schedule. The increase of £7 per week in the old age contributory pension will bring it up to £96 per week, which is just marginally short of the target we set when we took office in 1997. We have delivered on our commitments to old age pensioners. The widows' or widowers' contributory pension for those who are 66 years or older has increased to £89.10 and the old age non-contributory pension has increased to £85. These figures mean that those categories of pensioners are on line to achieve the target of £100 per week by 2002.</P>
    <P>The above increases are real increases, they are a big improvement on the minuscule increases granted by previous Governments. I remind Deputy Ring that, approximately two and a half years ago when he was Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa gave old age pensioners an increase of £1.75.</P>

      <P>I welcome the many positive provisions in the Bill. In my opinion this legislation gives concrete expression to the pragmatic philosophy which underpins all the Government's actions, namely, that the benefits of our extraordinarily successful economy should be shared by all citizens and sectors of society. I particularly welcome those specific provisions which target the socially excluded and those with disabilities in a manner designed to improve their conditions and, where possible, to enable them to participate actively and fully in contributing to our society and economy.</P>
      <P>Government policy is designed to enable all citizens, regardless of their capabilities, to make the fullest contribution consistent with the talents they possess to the society in which we live. The Government's stated policy in improving the lot of the major categories of welfare recipients is clearly and irrefutably evidenced by a comparison of its three budgets with the three introduced by the rainbow coalition.</P>
      <P>Let me provide some of facts and figures which speak volumes. Under the rainbow coalition, between 1995 and 1997, there was an increase in the old age contributory pension of 9.9%, while under the current Government, between 1998 and 2000, there has been an increase of 23.1%. Under the rainbow coalition, widows' contributory pension increased by 10.2%, while under the current Government it increased by 14.1%. Unemployment disability benefit increased by 10.7% under the rainbow coalition, while it increased by 26.7% under the current Government. Long-term unemployment assistance increased by 10.7% under the rainbow coalition, while it increased by 14.8% under the current Government. Short-term unemployment assistance increased by 11% under the rainbow coalition, while it increased by 16.2% under the current Government. Those statistics refute some of the points made earlier by Deputy Ring.</P>
      <P>The comparison of these figures is most instructive. The Government has kept its promises and will continue to do so. We are within striking distance of £100 for the old age pension, as promised, and we will also continue improvements for all categories of recipients. In all instances we have provided much better increases and, in the case of pensioners, over twice the level provided by the rainbow coalition. In addition, the rate of inflation has been lowered in the past three years so that the real level of increases to recipients has been, in all cases, even higher again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social provisions of the budget that are incorporated in the Bill show clearly that this is a caring Government which keeps faith with the old and the disadvantaged through the better benefits and service provision. The Bill also pro<Col N="898" /> vides £530 million for people on low incomes, including measures over and above those announced in the budget. These are central to the comprehensive framework of policies costing £1.5 billion which the Government is introducing to combat social exclusion in the coming years and will ensure full participation by all citizens in society.</P>
    <P>These measures have been widely welcomed by the social partners and they are a cornerstone of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The programme, the latest in the series initiated by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, will continue the process of transforming society and will provide the mechanisms, structures and schemes for the distribution and sharing of the benefits of wealth creation among all citizens.</P>
    <P>PRSI exemption for employees is to be extended. Those earning less than £226 per week and paying class A and class H contributions will be exempt from PRSI. As a result, over 460,000 workers will gain an additional benefit of up to £5.67 per week. The earnings limit for exempting workers from the 2% health contribution is to be raised to £280 per week from £217, bringing the exemption up to £14,560 per year. This will mean an additional benefit for these workers of up to £5.60 per week.</P>
    <P>Reduced rates of old age contributory or retirement pension are also being increased by between £7.50 and £12.20 per week. The minimum family income supplement is being doubled to £10 per week, benefiting 1,000 families. The farm assist scheme for low income farmers is being improved. I am glad that these benefits will also be extended to low income fishermen. I have a particular interest in the welfare of these people because the port at Howth is in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The new carer's benefit to which Deputy O'Flynn referred is being extended to 15 months from the original budget proposal of 12 months for carer's with at least three years contributions who are employed for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight. These people will now be able to take up a job-protected leave of absence with the financial support of this new benefit. That is a welcome development because the people to whom I refer do a tremendous job in the community.</P>
    <P>There are also many welcome improvements in schemes which are designed to encourage people to return to work. The number of places on the back to work allowance scheme is being increased from 29,000 to 34,000 and the scheme is also being extended to cover people in receipt of invalidity pension or unemployment supplement. A range of additional educational supports will also assist and encourage people to acquire the necessary qualifications to enhance their prospects of gaining and maintaining full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The number of people on the live register has been reduced by the Government's policies to 171,786, of whom 142,900, 83%, are in receipt of payment. This is the lowest figure in 17 years. The numbers on the live register have fallen by over <Col N="899" /> 80,000 since June 1997, when the current Government took office. Our policies are obviously working, although to listen to Deputy Ring &ndash; I do not know what planet he is on &ndash; one would not believe that to be the case.</P>
    <P>Substantial changes in the arrangements for retention of rent and mortgage supplement on their social welfare allowance for people on community employment schemes, the back to work allowance scheme and the revenue job assist scheme are being made as follows &ndash; the current £250 limit will be abolished; the back to work allowance and family income supplement payments will be disregarded in assessing gross income; the withdrawal of the supplement will be phased over a four year period &ndash; 75%, 50%, 25% and 25%; the additional income payable to recipients on improved training courses will no longer be counted as means; a disregard of £25 per week is being introduced for part-time workers from April; an additional £100,000 will be provided for the scheme of grants towards the development and promotion of second chance education opportunities and a pilot project for early school leavers on the live register will be introduced to improve their employability.</P>
    <P>This list of measures is by no means exhaustive but it clearly illustrates the creativeness and thoroughness of the approach to bringing the excluded and disadvantaged into the workforce by giving them the incentives and the training to make a contribution to their own and the common prosperity.</P>
    <P>All these measures and many others contained in the Bill to which I have not referred must inevitably reduce the number of those unemployed and move us towards our goal of full employment. There are now jobs for all who want to work. The Government is committed to the removal of all educational, structural and cultural obstacles and impediments to employment, and the elimination of those conditions which prevent citizens from contributing actively and productively to our society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring accused civil servants of not performing their duties in a fair way. I disagree with that and I take exception to anyone referring to civil servants and officials in the way he did. The social welfare office in Kilbarrack in my constituency does a tremendous job. The officials are very helpful and caring. They go out of their way and act above and beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the content of the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a missed opportunity to introduce some real equality in our society. As the country is garnering wealth and riches, we are reminded daily of our great economic success. However, this success is measurable only for those who can go into the workplace and help drive the economy to even greater success. The benefits of the thriving economy do not seem to be making their way to those most in need.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak in particular about the lot of carers and how they have been considered in this Bill. While the increases in their weekly allowance are to be welcomed, the overall concessions given to this group in the Bill fall far short of the recognition they deserve. The nature and quality of the service they provide continues to be seriously underestimated. An affluent society has no right to ignore or dismiss the valuable contribution of these people who have given so much so willingly and for such little reward. Carers look after those who cannot look after themselves. It is estimated that 100,000 people currently provide care for family members in their own homes. The commitment of carers, the sacrifices they make and the expenses they incur in carrying out their work have never been meaningfully recognised.</P>
      <P>The failure of the Government to reform the means test for carer's allowance is unacceptable. The new carer's benefit is designed for workers who leave their jobs on a temporary basis to care for a relative. It only lasts for 15 months and will not offer a single benefit to existing carers. It ignores the needs of those who find themselves in the incredibly difficult situation of trying to decide if they should give up their job and forfeit their benefits. This category of carer needs special consideration. For them, caring is their life and their career. No real value is being placed on this commitment. In effect, they are being told they must either give up their caring role within 15 months or they will lose out. The new measure will be of help only in a situation where short-term care is needed and where the carer has the expectation of returning to work within the relatively short period set aside, that is, 15 months. The Bill does nothing to take account of the circumstances of a carer looking after someone who, although in need of care, has a long life expectancy.</P>
      <P>At current levels of costing, the cost of funding all full-time carers would be £150 million per year. This figure is not unrealistic when we are running a budgetary surplus of £6 billion. The Government does not seem to have taken account of what the real cost to the State would be if carers decided to let the State carry the burden of providing accommodation and nursing care, sometimes on an around the clock basis, for those in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from the Bill that only those who can, or wish to, go out to work every day are to be valued. A woman &ndash; it is almost always a woman &ndash; who decides to give up a well paid job to become a full-time carer is neglected and deprived by the system. For example, a woman <Col N="901" /> who has chosen to give up her well paid nursing job to look after her dependent 20 year old son who was injured in a car accident can expect little or nothing from this Bill. She has chosen to look after her son at home. She has given up her job and relinquished her long-term pension rights. She has, in effect, taken on a 24 hour caring role. Her leisure time is no longer her own and there are many other hidden personal costs to her. However, for all this sacrifice and taking on a burden of responsibility that rightly belongs to the State, she receives a miserable allowance which goes nowhere towards meeting the real cost of looking after her son. Her career prospects are also ended. No account is taken of either of these facts.</P>
    <P>The message from this is that the Government values only those people who can join the booming economy and help promote it, that is, those people who go out to work each day outside their home. This is unfair and is another example of discrimination against women in particular, who are almost always the carers.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of the bureaucracy associated with the claiming for and payment of social welfare allowances. Those who need to claim social welfare allowances are frequently vulnerable and frightened and are often upset at the very idea of having to make a claim in the first place. They are intimidated by what appears to them to be a frightening number of application forms, in which they seem to have to provide endless personal details and proof of identification each time they make an application for an allowance to which they are fully entitled. They are confronted by what they perceive as officialdom and sometimes a lack of discretion and understanding by the system. They live in fear of their benefits being reduced or removed. Surely, in this age of information technology, it is possible to streamline the application and identification system to allow people to claim their allowances with dignity and without fear.</P>
    <P>This Bill is delivered to us in a time of plenty. There is small comfort in it for those who are marginalised in any way when they look at the material benefits and affluence which prevail. I gave the position of carers as an example of how this Bill has failed those most in need. It does not serve to promote the values of this society, which is supposed to be caring and concerned, and it attributes little value to the meaning of the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. The improvement in the standard of living of those whom the Bill is intended to serve will be barely detectable in the light of the new allowances. It will serve to once again highlight the gap between the haves and the have nots in our society. This is happening at a time when the Government had an alternative and could have been much more generous.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo ar an mBille seo. The Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill <Col N="902" /> are inextricably linked each year. I want to make some points on what is not contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>When we look at the benefits that accrued to taxpayers in the Finance Bill, we see that a single earner earning £50,000 per year received an income increase of £32 per week while a single person earning £10,000 per year received an income increase of £4 per week.</P>
      <P>A 60 year old man who is within the age group for pre-retirement payment came to discuss his case with me recently. He works three days per week and receives social welfare unemployment assistance payment for the other three days. His income was means tested in 1996 and a new test was carried out recently. The net result is that he is losing £5 for each of the three days he is in receipt of unemployment assistance. The only increases he received in the period between the two means tests were those he received under national pay agreements. This is absolutely appalling and is not dealt with in the Bill. It is time to look at the means test limits and formulae. Is it good enough that, at a time when a single earner earning £50,000 per year is receiving an increase of £32 per week, the person on social welfare who came to speak to me is losing £15 per week?</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the increase in unemployment assistance which amounts to the princely sum of £4 but this anomaly must be addressed as it is inequitable, unfair and part of the Government's ethos of focusing on the better off in society.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a recent case concerning a 78 year old widow with two intellectually disabled children, one of whom died in 1998. At that time, this widow received a carer's allowance and a half carer's allowance. When her daughter, who was an adult, died she lost the half carer's allowance and was then subjected to a means test. This woman receives a UK widow's pension. When the first means test was carried out the exchange rate was very different and there have been improvements in her UK pension since. However, the net result is that she has lost her carer's allowance. She is 78 years old and caring for an intellectually disabled daughter. Her daughter is a large person and caring for her involves physically demanding activities such as bathing and washing her hair which are becoming more difficult as this widow becomes older. However, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has decided not to help her and is not interested in her problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Butter vouchers may seem a small issue and the argument can be made that it is an EU scheme which operates from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for which the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs acts as an agent. These vouchers have been removed. The scheme involves only 36p per month but it is 36p for the poorest in society. Even though the EU source of the butter is gone the Department should not have allowed a situation to arise where the least well off in society are losing 36p per month while a single person on £50,000 per year will gain £32 under <Col N="903" /> the provisions in the Finance Bill. Where is the equity in this scenario? I implore the Minister to re-examine this situation and make good the loss suffered by those who had been receiving butter vouchers.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the issue of occupationally induced diseases under the occupational injuries scheme as they relate to disability benefit. I recently dealt with a case involving an individual who was a hard worker but now suffers from osteoarthritis. This individual's GP is convinced that this problem is due to his occupation. However, osteoarthritis is not a prescribed ailment but it should be viewed as an occupational injury. I am not sure to what extent the legislation will cover this issue. However, where there is no doubt that a disability which prevents someone from working was induced by their work, surely it is inequitable, unjust and unacceptable to deny disability benefit to sufferers.</P>
    <P>I have spoken previously in this House and in the Seanad of the attitude adopted by medical referees. Last weekend I dealt with an individual who was upset at the treatment he received from a medical referee. There should be a fast track independent appeals mechanism for those who feel upset, offended or concerned at the way they have been treated by these referees. During appeal hearings the appeals officer asks people if they are satisfied with the examinations carried out by medical referees. However, this process takes too long. Deputy Ring referred to the fact that it takes forever to arrange an appeal hearing and the Minister must take urgent action to speed up the appeals process.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the length of time it takes to process applications in Sligo. There is a need to bring in consultants or whoever to examine procedures and to provide extra staff if required. It is taking far too long to process applications and something must be done about this problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a PRSI exemption limit of £226. However, there is a cut-off point. If the figure is £226.01 the person pays the normal rate of PRSI. Surely we should not have such a cut-off point and there should be an incremental entitlement. Such an incremental scale would provide that a person only has to pay three-quarters of the rate for a certain level over £226, tapering to a half and a quarter. Arbitrary cut-off points where a few pence make the difference between whether one pays PRSI are not acceptable and a more consumer friendly approach is required.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance has been adequately dealt with by Deputy Upton. The much vaunted old age pension of £100 will be effective from 2002. However, as a millennium gesture, and in the context of the huge budget surplus, this should have been introduced this year as a once off measure as expected by some senior citizens. The Minister should re-examine this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I have long had grave concerns about the treatment of widows and widowers. They constitute the worst treated group in receipt of social welfare. To lose a partner is an enormous trauma but it also has a significant effect on income. People find themselves cut off from so many props of their existence. I welcome the introduction of the widows grant of £1,000. I would like to see a monetary recognition of the position of widows. Perhaps the Minister will examine the idea on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of unprecedented economic growth and prosperity the challenge of effectively dealing with social inequality must be at the top of the national agenda. At its extreme, inequality and lack of opportunity can lead to poverty and profound social deprivation. Social research has continually shown that the effects of exclusion are deep and wide, with increased vulnerability to unemployment and homelessness with its wide ranging consequences, including substance abuse and involvement in crime. When society does not provide the full range of supports necessary for an individual or family the effects can be oppressive and may last for several generations. The only responsible way to approach budgets or financial proposals for social support must be to assess if the benefits are likely to provide substantial improvements in the short-term and to act as pillars in the long-term establishment of social justice.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, and the wide ranging initiatives of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, since his appointment in 1997, I have no doubt that he will make a major contribution to the vital task of eliminating poverty and social exclusion in the State. His commitment to the cause of equality and his ability to address this enormous task are abundantly clear. The wide range of provisions in the Bill satisfies the twin needs of immediate improvements for those in greatest need and the progressive introduction of features which support longer term social improvements and growth. The unprecedented scale of the Minister's proposals is evident from the size of the package, approximately £428 million, a clear reflection of the level of commitment of the Taoiseach and Cabinet to the objective securing social justice.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the basic sense of fairness which runs through many of the provisions in the Bill. He is delivering a major programme of improvements for older citizens and is well on the way to providing a basic support of £100 per week by 2002. Similarly, the rate of progress in the vital area of support for carers is most welcome. The total number of people in receipt of carer's allowance has increased by 60% since the Minister was appointed. This is reflected in the doubling of the funding for the scheme from £36.5 million to £78.3 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> The sensitivity of the Minister is evident in the provisions for pensions for those people with pre-1953 insurance. Equally, the new payments for the widowed parents and to help with after death arrears are certain to provide much needed extra assistance to families at a time of great distress and pain. These proposals will have a positive, far-reaching impact on society by tackling our greatest social need in a manner which addresses the full range of requirements in an integrated, effective and compassionate manner. The Minister has taken another major step towards giving effective voice to the aspirations of the Constitution, which orders that each person is treated equally.</P>
    <P>The road to comprehensive social justice and equality in society is long and difficult. It would be dishonest to suggest that problems and imbalances which have taken decades to manifest themselves are amenable to overnight resolution. Anyone who takes such a position is by no means making a contribution to the most noble of social and political causes. Real progress only comes on the back of sustained commitment, creative planning and substantial resource allocation. Taking into account his excellent achievements to date, I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern's, contribution to the cause of social inclusion and meaningful caring will be effective in the short and long-terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the many wonderful measures introduced by the Minister for Finance in his recent budget, all attention was focused on individualisation. This Bill has given Members an opportunity to look at social welfare and for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to explain the major improvements made in the recent budget. The Bill will give effect to those changes which will account for more than £400 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>This Government acknowledged at an early stage that the largest problems it faced were the construction of an inclusive society and tackling poverty. It is committed to improving the living standards of all. We may read everyday about Internet millionaires but we must not lose sight of the fact that there is still a great deal of poverty. Standards must be improved, we cannot let these people be forgotten.</P>
      <P>All social welfare recipients will receive more. Fianna Fáil gave a commitment that old age pensioners would receive at least £100 per week before the Government finished in office. With recent increases to the old age contributory and retirement pensions raising payments to £96 per week, our target of £100 is on course. It is not, however, something about which we should clap ourselves on the back. Governments are judged by how they look after those who cannot look after themselves. When we gave that commitment we were berated by the media and the Opposition but we have delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa is lucky to be in Europe. When he was Minister for Social Welfare recipi<Col N="906" /> ents expected great things from him.

      <P>The Government realises the important role child benefit plays in providing financial support to families, particularly mothers. Child benefit is collected by women for the needs of their children. The changes announced in this year's budget will mean a 23% increase in the cost of the scheme and families of three children will now get £141. That is substantial but we must improve it if we are to deal with poverty. I am delighted that the Minister has chosen to take that approach.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Woods, some time ago. It is a wonderful idea and all Governments since have tried to expand and improve on it. Since 1997, 5,000 more people have received the carer's allowance while the cost to the scheme has doubled. It again demonstrates that the Government is committed to acknowledging the tremendous contribution carers make to society and that it is prepared to reward them financially.</P>
      <P>I am sure all in the House who deal with carers on a regular basis and are aware of the difficulties and hardships they face would support my view that the conditions attaching to the scheme are too restrictive and that insufficient numbers qualify. Greater flexibility should be introduced to allow more people to avail of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It was a wonderful idea to introduce the free travel scheme. Many elderly people avail of it on a regular basis. However, to benefit it is almost necessary to live in an urban centre or near regular transport facilities. The many elderly people who live in rural areas are largely excluded. The Minister should introduce a voucher system to enable people use taxi services as there is hardly a village in the country without one. The change in attitudes to drink driving has resulted in an enormous increase in the number of taxis. A voucher system would give elderly people an opportunity to travel and do their business, whether it be attending church or shopping in the local town. It would give them an independence they do not have at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring castigated social welfare officials. He appears to use the same speech to criticise everything. He should not tar all officials with the one brush. Not everybody should be blamed if he or one of his constituents has had a bad experience. If I had a bad experience with a Fine Gael Member of the House I would not like to take it out on everybody else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen referred to the donation offered by J.P. McManus for the proposed national stadium. Most ordinary decent people would applaud his tremendous generosity in providing sporting facilities for us all. Deputy Allen's attitude to this is despicable. I know many of his party colleagues do not agree with him. I appreciate Mr. McManus's generosity and I thank him for it.</P>
      <P>Some parts of the media portrayed the budget as one for the rich. However, the facts tell a different story. There will be significant changes in social welfare payments. It is clear to all that the Government cares for the country and for all the people.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Power's proposal on extending the free travel scheme. He rightly points out that people in rural areas do not have access to public transport. If a voucher scheme could be introduced it would be very beneficial. The Department operates a scheme with the private bus operators, but to my knowledge most of them do not avail of it. Perhaps it would be possible for the Department to encourage them to make more use of it. This is important because it would help pensioners and other social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minster on introducing this very innovative Bill. Deputy O'Shea rightly said the Finance and Social Welfare Bills are inextricably linked. We cannot view them in isolation from the national development plan and the recently negotiated Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Over the years there have been clear social and economic benefits from the partnership agreements. Today there are 600,000 more people in employment than was the case ten or 12 years ago. This makes it possible to distribute wealth. The Fianna Fáil Party adheres to the philosophy of striving to achieve a fairer and more inclusive society. It is, therefore, important that the growing wealth of the country is distributed fairly.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the position of low income workers. The Minister has introduced innovative measures, especially with regard to social insurance contributions. Since the Government took up office in June 1997, some 135,000 people have been taken out of the tax net. By definition, they were on the low income scale. A comparison of this and the previous Government's record on increases in social welfare payments shows that in the period 1998 to 2000, non-contributory pensions have increased by almost 27% while contributory pensions have increased by in excess of 23%. Over a similar period under the previous Government, non-contributory pensions increased by only 10.7% while contributory pensions increased by less than 10%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that there should be proper and generous increases in the various social welfare benefits and the Government has rightly set an objective of ensuring that all social welfare payments reach at least £100 per week. I welcome <Col N="908" /> the Minister's success in securing additional funding for the budgetary measures to deal with social welfare recipients and those on lower incomes. The Bill provides for reductions of almost £103 million in PRSI and health contribution levies for low paid employees. That is very important and a welcome addition for lower income groups.</P>
    <P>All speakers made understandable reference to the carer's allowance. We welcome the improvements to the scheme. Its importance is demonstrated by reference to the numbers availing of it. At the end of February 14,200 people were in receipt of the allowance, an increase from 9,200 in the middle of 1997. The extension of the free schemes to carers is very important and the new carer's benefit is an innovative, necessary and welcome measure. We all know people who have had to give up employment to care for a parent, son or daughter. The uncertainty of future employment prospects places an additional burden on them.</P>
    <P>The residency requirement of the scheme was changed a number of years ago, but it could be relaxed further. The carer not living under the same roof as the person being cared for must live nearby. The cases of those who are constant visitors and who give constant attendance to a person in need of care should be examined favourably.</P>
    <P>The unrealistic assessment of returns from capital has been raised many times in the House when debating Social Welfare Bills. I welcome the Minister's decision to have the first £10,000 of capital disregarded, both for the assessment of pensions and unemployment assistance. In our work as public representatives we constantly meet people who think they need to keep some savings for unforeseen expenditure or burial expenses. As a result, they often deprive themselves of a pension payment or they only receive a small pension. I also welcome the improvement in the farm assist scheme which is so important in rural areas and which the Department introduced a year ago.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to RSI as it affects meter readers employed by the ESB. I understand meter readers pay class S rate contributions. They are not regarded as employees by the ESB but as contractors. However, in terms of RSI and income tax they are paid as if they are employees. This issue has been ongoing for some time and the relatively small number of people affected by it are anxious to have their contribution changed from class S to class A. I hope the officials and the Minister will make progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department on the grants scheme it operates for voluntary organisations. All of us are aware of the very valuable work undertaken by community and voluntary groups in urban and rural areas. The grant assistance provided makes the difference in the provision of facilities, which groups might not otherwise be able to provide, which may be used by elderly people on a once a week basis as a day care centre etc. I hope the Minister will extend this scheme over the coming years.</P>

      <P>This morning all speakers referred to carer's allowance and the wonderful work being done by carers. I am sorry the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is not present, although I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. Carer's allowance has been a hobby-horse of mine. I spoke on the Social Welfare Bills in 1998 and 1999, and the record will show that I gave practically the same speech on both occasions. I am beginning to wonder about the relevance of Deputies, particularly Opposition Deputies, speaking for the ten minutes allocated to them and giving vent to experiences in their constituencies, while the Minister and his officials do not take one blind bit of notice of the message which Deputies have gathered from meeting people in constituencies and clinics. We are only participating in a farce if nobody is listening; we are only speaking for the record to show to our constituents. If this continues, one of the functions of backbench Deputies will be eliminated as there will be no point in them raising their experiences with the Minister in the hope of getting action on anomalies which arise in the social welfare system. I have been raising the anomalies in relation to one simple matter for two and half years.</P>
      <P>I would like to have one glaring anomaly in carer's allowance corrected. I have brought this to the notice of the Minister who can refer to my parliamentary question tabled in October 1997 when I first brought it to his attention. Since then I have written letters continuously to the Department and have raised it at every possible committee, at every public forum and in debate on the two most recent Social Welfare Acts. Initially I was told a review group was examining carer's allowance and that it would report in a year. I made submissions to the review group and stated the case very clearly, but no corrective action was taken. I am beginning to wonder if we are talking to ourselves or if anybody is taking a blind bit of notice of issues raised constantly by backbenchers in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking from personal experience in my constituency. I am familiar with a carer who is caring for her husband's relative in their own home. The relative is incontinent and bed-ridden 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. She qualified for the carer's allowance because her husband's income was less than £150 per week. Unfortunately, three years ago her husband was killed in an accident. She continued to care for her husband's relative and now qualifies for the widow's pension of £73.50 per week to compensate her for the loss of her husband's income. The week she got the widow's pension, the carer's allowance was taken from her. I have asked the Minister to <Col N="910" /> address this problem. It is criminal, sinful and anti-social that a carer who receives a widow's pension to compensate for the loss of her husband loses the carer's allowance while continuing to be a carer.</P>
    <P>At various times I was told that giving social welfare recipients a carer's allowance would cost a huge amount of money. In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Creed, in October 1999, the Minister said that from the commencement of the carer's allowance in 1990 until 15 December, a period of ten years, the total number of persons refused for the reason that they were already in receipt of a social welfare payment was 214. If these 214 people were allowed receive the carer's allowance, it would have cost the State about £800,000 a year. However, it would cost the State more than £800,000 a week if those cared for were in institutional care &ndash; it would cost over £4 million per year. I am not referring to all social welfare recipients, although a case can be made for them. I ask the Minister to examine the situation whereby carers who become widows can continue to care and receive the carer's allowance while being allowed to draw the widow's pension, the only compensation for the loss of their spouse.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to please bring this message back to the Department, see what the review group did about it and find out what the Minister and his officials will do. I should not have to come back to the House to give the very same speech on next year's Social Welfare Bill as I have given for the past two years. We want action and a little bit of fair play for people in the community who are doing wonderful work, as everybody says, caring for relatives and neighbours, rather than having those people ending their days in institutional care. Carers existed before the Celtic tiger was invented, and will continue to do so. I ask the Minister to please give carers the recognition due to them, particularly in the case I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another anomaly regarding a carer who qualifies for carer's allowance on the basis of caring for a person in her own home and whose spouse is in receipt of the old age pension. The spouse immediately loses the claim for his wife and his pension is reduced by £41.23. The carer qualifies for a carer's allowance of £73.50, which gives her a net additional income of £35. Such a full time carer, therefore, only qualifies for £35 per week. However, a similar carer in another situation will qualify for the full carer's allowance of £73.50.</P>
    <P>I will refrain from speaking about any scheme other than the carer's allowance. I want carers compensated for their caring, without it affecting the widow's pension or the spouse's pension.</P>
    <P>The carer should be compensated for caring without affecting in the case of a widow, her pension, and in the case of others, their spouse's pension or social welfare entitlement. If the allowance for a worker is £150 per week, why should such an allowance not apply to those on social <Col N="911" /> welfare? The Minister should address that problem. The Carers Association Limited has expressed its disappointment because there has been no extension of the means test for the carer's allowance. Will the Minister examine this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I have been a Member for a number of years and no matter which parties have been in Government, whether it was Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party or the Rainbow Coalition, they have always outlined the wonderful job their Minister for Social Welfare has done. The Minister made some decent changes, which I welcome. They were necessary and it was time they were made.</P>
      <P>However, he missed opportunities and I will focus on a number of them.</P>
      <P>If an economy is creating jobs, as is the case in Ireland currently, an incentive should always be given to people to work. For a number of years, there was such high unemployment that it was probably right to provide people on social welfare with a decent income. However, now that there is a labour shortage, people should be given incentives to take up employment and it should be better for them to work than stay at home. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated that Ireland must take in 200,000 immigrants over the next number of years to address the labour shortage but a large number of people are still available for work and they should be given incentives to do so.</P>
      <P>The Department should examine unemployment assistance in a regionalised manner rather than taking a global attitude to it. A large number of people are unemployable. One cannot look in isolation or globally upon somebody in their early 20s on unemployment assistance in the same way as somebody in their late 50s approaching retirement. There are differences which should be taken into consideration under the scheme, but that is not the case currently. For example, an individual who has farmed for 20 or 25 years and does not have a formal education could be refused unemployment assistance because he or she did not state that he or she was available for work. There is probably no work available which would suit such individuals and a different attitude should be adopted to deal with them in comparison to those in their early 20s who are seeking work and are capable of doing it. That concept should be taken on board by the Department when it assesses unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy McCormack, and others have dealt extensively with the carer's allowance. I welcome the changes to it but it must be examined in an economic rather than an emotional context. Carers is an emotional issue but, from an economic standpoint, I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy McCormack's comments. Every incentive should be given to people who are willing to look after members of their own family <Col N="912" /> at home or near their homes because the cost of institutionalising those who need full-time care and attention or of hospitalisation is four times the cost of caring for them in their own homes. That does not even take into consideration the emotional factors, such as the fact that people feel much more comfortable in their own homes. This must be examined in a different light.</P>
    <P>Departmental officials ask applicants for carer's allowance to prove that they cannot afford to look after these family members and why they should give them the money to do so. The attitude should be different. Carers should be commended for looking after their parents, children or other relatives and the officials should ask them what help they can provide to sustain them and keep their dependants in their own environment rather than putting them into hospitals and private nursing homes. I ask the Minister to examine whether incentives could be included for the carer's allowance to keep them at home.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a young lady who suffers from Crohn's disease. She could not attend college for a year and a half as a result. She applied for the disability allowance but was refused after two different medical examinations and appeals. That is unjust and I have raised this issue through parliamentary questions on a number of occasions. Individuals with such disabilities should receive a fairer crack of the whip. I find it extremely difficult on medical grounds to understand how any medical referee could not award a disability allowance to anyone suffering from this disease.</P>
    <P>I support the call for voucher schemes for free travel for people who live in rural areas. Public transport is not available in many areas. A voucher scheme would enable such people to hire taxis to take them to the nearest public transport point so that they could avail of free travel.</P>

      <P>This Bill is yet another disappointment and yet another missed opportunity by this Government. In 1986, long before the Celtic tiger, the Commission on Social Welfare recommended minimum levels of welfare payments. It was only 13 years later, in 1999, that those levels were finally reached. What happened in the interim is the question. After a period of mass unemployment and emigration and the devastation of communities, we saw an economic upturn which reduced unemployment and emigration but which has not eliminated poverty.</P>
      <P>While many have benefited, the gap between those dependent on social welfare and their fellow citizens has widened in this economy. The economic upturn has been built on the efforts of workers, a majority of whom in a survey published in November 1999 favoured social spending rather than tax reductions as a means of achieving a more egalitarian society. The budget and the social welfare Bill go in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now move to some of the specific provisions in the Bill. In regard to the increase in the personal rates of social welfare payments, the Bill <Col N="913" /> generally continues the policy of recent years. Similar to last year and the previous year, the elderly are singularly prioritised. The Bill provides for increases of £7 per week in the personal rate for pensioners aged 66 and over and for people on retirement and validity pension aged 65 and over. As in the past five or six years the increase in other social welfare payments is somewhat higher than inflation but lower than the growth in average incomes.</P>
    <P>We must certainly provide these increases for the elderly and, indeed, more, but the key point is that the incomes of other social welfare recipients &ndash; the unemployed, ill, disabled, widows, widowers, lone parents and carers &ndash; are being allowed to lag behind. The Economic and Social Research Institute has repeatedly warned that a continuation of this general policy will see an increase in relative poverty.</P>
    <P>The fact that those on age-related payments will receive larger increases than those on other social welfare payments will create a two tier system and treat one group, namely older people, as deserving and the other group, comprising unemployed people, lone parents, widows, widowers and the other people I mentioned, as undeserving. That must be addressed. Let me state clearly and without equivocation that I welcome the special increases for pensioners which are in line with the commitment made in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium. We must wait until May before the contributory old age pension will reach £96. However, for those in receipt of non-contributory old-age pensions, the figure will only reach £85.50 in May. It is expected that we must wait until 2002 for the level of income recommended for those on the lowest level to be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase of £8 per month in child benefit for the first two children and £10 per month for each subsequent child. While larger than last year, these increases cannot be expected to have a substantial impact on child poverty.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an anomalous aspect of the Minister's budget speech. The Minister is a spin doctor in his own right. Take, for example, his over-sell of the increase in the threshold below which people on low pay are exempted from the health contribution. The Minister made much of the fact that the increase from £217 per week to the new threshold of £280 per week would allow for benefits of up to £5.60 per week at a cost of £52.6 million in a full year. The Minister misrepresents the facts because raising the threshold from £217 to £280 only confers an additional benefit of £1.26 per week or 2% of the £63 difference, not the erroneous claim of £5.60 per week which equates with 2% of the entire £280 sum. We were not all asleep when reading the detail of the Minister's speech.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the many imaginative provisions which he is introducing in this Bill. Expectations are very high among the electorate at present. As a public representative, I find it is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy people's new demands. In the past, many groups and organisations simply put up with a bad situation as the State did not have the necessary resources to deal with their problems. That is no longer the case. These groups and organisations are now demanding action to address their concerns, posing a challenge for all of us involved in public life.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responding to people's concerns in a positive and imaginative way. Groups such as the elderly, carers, parents and the low paid are targeted to great effect in this budget. Many of the Bill's provisions arise from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which I welcome. Social partnership is the key to our economic success. The programme will bring about a more inclusive society and I hope it will be accepted in due course by all concerned.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that social welfare increases will take effect from May this year. In the past, social welfare claimants were rightly furious that in some cases they had to wait until July to receive their increases. Other budget measures are generally implemented at a much earlier date, some coming into effect from budget night. Social welfare claimants were very annoyed by this and the Minister has done a good day's work in rectifying this grievance once and for all. Next year, the implementation date for social welfare increases, will coincide with the start of the tax year in early April.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions in regard to child benefit. All the reports indicate that the best way to deal with child poverty is to increase child benefit which also has a major role to play in addressing the child care issue in a fair and equitable manner. Child benefit is a means of demonstrating positive support for families. Following the enactment of this Bill, child benefit will increase to £42.50 for the first two children and £56 for the third child and subsequent children. I welcome the Minister's commitment to continue to provide substantial increases in child benefit with a priority focus on £100 per month for the third child and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise the position of lone parents who are in receipt of rent supplements and the lone parent allowance. There is a great disincentive for them to obtain full employment as they would lose their supplementary welfare allowance were they to take up employment in the private sector. They would also incur huge child care expenses. In effect, they are trapped. I appreciate that incentives already exist and that more are provided for in this Bill to assist people to transfer from welfare to work. However, they are inad<Col N="915" /> equate in regard to lone parents and the issue should be given further attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions in regard to the elderly, particularly the £7 increase in the old age pension. Much progress has been made on medical card eligibility for the over 70s. The Minister for Finance announced in a previous budget that income guideline eligibility would be doubled over a three year period. That is to be welcomed although this issue should be revisited with a view to reducing the age to 66 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for data sharing whereby the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would provide local authorities with landlord details of tenancies in respect of which rent supplements are payable to allow them to fulfil their statutory responsibilities in regard to fire safety and accommodation standards in private rented accommodation. Many landlords are simply not registering with local authorities as they are obliged to do under housing regulations and their failure to do so has consequences for the condition of our private rented housing stock. I welcome the fact that the data sharing provisions will ensure that landlords will comply with the law.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about carers and means testing. It seems that the complete abolition of the means test would cost taxpayers in the region of £200 million and that their money might not be best spent in that way. Perhaps the Minister will consider this issue with a view to increasing the income disregard in future budgets. On which Department should pay the carer's allowance, there may be some merit in the view that the allowance should be paid by the Department of Health and Children which is involved in all aspects of citizens' health and which would have the wherewithal to deal with the complexities associated with carers and the people they care for. Perhaps the Minister will consider that in the coming year. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support this Bill because, despite the empty rhetoric and negative comment from the Opposition, this is a positive measure and a realistic improvement in the circumstances of those who draw social welfare benefits. The theme of the Bill is positive and demonstrates that this is a caring Government, continuing its traditional support for the less well-off. While the Opposition may try to represent our policies as neglecting low earners, the level of support for the new pay agreement clearly shows that a majority of the social partners do not feel the less well-off are being left behind. They are not being neglected by this Bill and I am happy to support the Minister's proposals which give significant increases across the board and especially where they are needed most. I need hardly go into the record of our predecessors who, when necessity was greater, chose to make their savings at the expense of the people who could protest least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> In the past three years, this Government has given the long-term unemployed a composite 14.8% increase in times of low inflation, while in the previous three years, under the rainbow Government, the corresponding figure was just 10.7%. Old age pensioners got a 23.1% increase from this Government while the rainbow Government managed only a 9.9% increase, a miserly sum, even in less prosperous times. The short-term unemployed received a 16.2% increase from this Government and an 11% increase from the rainbow Government. Percentage increases, which translate into money in pockets, are the only yardstick and in the past three years we have done extremely well by those people who get some or all of their incomes from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in child benefit of £8 per month for the first and second children and £10 per month for the third and subsequent children is generous and represents a realistic improvement in a payment which penetrates right to the heart of the family. I have spoken to the Minister many times about the need to review the free fuel scheme. The payment of £5 per week is outdated. While I accept it is paid for only half the year and granting an increase may cause curtailment in another area, it should be increased. This would be a positive and significant benefit to those who would receive it. We find it difficult to understand how a bag of coal often represents a measure of comfort for the old.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his support of an initiative in Waterford city &ndash; the Waterford Student Mothers Group, with which I am glad to be aligned &ndash; which was founded by Bernadette Phillips and Teresa Casey. They decided to give young student mothers, who under other circumstances might feel the opportunity for education had passed them by, another chance in the classroom. I had the pleasure of launching its first annual report recently, at which I said that of all the desires of humankind over the centuries, education must rank as one of the highest. Of all the necessities of this modern, highly technical and technological age, education is one of the most important, but also one which can bypass the individual who is not, for a variety of reasons, able to avail of what is on offer.</P>
    <P>A new horizon has been created for young student mothers because of the work of this group and their lives now have a new and more positive meaning. I thank the Minister for his assistance in bridging the gap over the many Departments dealing with this area and I can report positive results from Waterford in this important field. This is effectively a pilot project which will give hope to those in other areas of the country who need it. In terms of value for money, solid achievement, or however one decides to quantify the work of this group, the participants, administrators and the State come out ahead. The Waterford Student Mothers Group initiative is, by any standards, innovative and I know other <Col N="917" /> areas are looking closely at it. There is a growing feeling that the Waterford experience is worthwhile and has much to offer the individual and the community in the long-term.</P>
    <P>One of the most innovative and valuable schemes ever produced by the Department is the student summer jobs scheme. It has been excellent in terms of value for money and in terms of the genuine contribution it has made to the communities in which it operates, it has had few equals. The scheme has benefited the students and the communities in which they have worked. Any suggestion that it should be abolished in the present prosperous economic climate should be quickly discouraged. While its original purpose was to benefit students, a succession of worthwhile projects have been quietly and efficiently brought to fruition under its aegis, to the benefit of a broad section of the population.</P>
    <P>The number of coaching schemes, summer camps, educational projects, minor building works, club development programmes and local authority schemes which have benefited will never by fully appreciated. However, many groups which have come to depend on this welcome subvention dread the thought that it might be abolished now that times are good. I urge the Minister to allay their fears and confirm that the scheme will operate again this year. Far from it being a drain on people's pockets or Exchequer funds, there is a measurable net gain to society and individual communities know that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing up to date another element of the social welfare code. Heretofore, contributions made prior to 1953 were of no benefit to people returning to the workforce but now, under section 16 of the Bill, they may be used to help applicants qualify for a special rate of pension. This is long overdue and I thank the Minister for making this change and the other measures implemented in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on correcting many anomalies, as he has done in previous Social Welfare Bills. It is heartening that the money saved in certain parts of his Department is being given to those most in need. As politicians we are quick to criticise but I wish to compliment the departmental officials. When I became a Deputy, the Department of Social Welfare was not my favourite. However, in recent years it has become one of the most efficient Departments in dealing with the concerns of and representations from public representatives.</P>

    <P>The carer's allowance is the most common issue with which I deal. The means test is still far too rigid. I can quote numerous examples of people with modest incomes where the partner has no choice but to stay in the home to look after their children and their elderly relatives. They are not prepared to put their elderly relatives into nursing homes, and they should have this choice. This needs to be looked at before the next Social <Col N="918" /> Welfare Bill. In many cases these people are not entitled to a respite grant.</P>
    <P>The care of the elderly needs to be addressed immediately. Thankfully, people are living longer. However, there is no proper policy to deal with this. Subvention to nursing homes costs the State a huge amount of money. However, this does not go far enough to provide for a person in a private nursing home. We should look at how programmes operate in other countries. We should encourage families to keep their parents and relatives in the family home. This would relieve the pressure on nursing homes and public hospitals which are doing excellent work, but which, unfortunately, do not have enough places.</P>
    <P>One of my hobby horses, of which the Minister is aware, is the extension of the free fuel scheme to widows and widowers. I have said for many years that this is an anomaly. I have listened to the Minister's arguments about why he cannot extend the scheme. However, an exception should be made and the free schemes for electricity, television licences, free fuel and so on should be made available to widows and widowers. We should realise that people are at their most vulnerable when they lose a partner and we should do something about their position.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance is currently £5 per week during the winter months but it is time we seriously examined that figure. I suggest the Minister should pay £25 per week throughout the year. In latter years, with the inclement weather, people often have to use fuel during the summer. It is a bit of a contradiction that the fuel allowance is payable only during the winter months. I realise there is a serious cost involved but rather than praise all the positive aspects of the Bill, I want to identify the areas where improvements should be made.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me is that when pensioners and social welfare recipients get their increases at budget time, the local authorities are the first in with increases of their own which absorb most of the increases provided for in the budget. We have raised this matter with members of local authorities on numerous occasions but they seem to immediately take advantage of the increases granted to pensioners.</P>
    <P>Coming from a rural constituency I welcome the slight improvements in the farm assist scheme but, for whatever reason, the administration of the scheme on the ground, particularly in the Leinster region, appears to make it more difficult for farmers experiencing problems to qualify under the scheme. Some social welfare officers seem to be of the view that if a person comes from that part of the country they have bigger farms and larger incomes, but we still get the same price for cattle and sheep, and that was not particularly good in 1999. Perhaps the Minister might advise social welfare officers that they should be a little more lenient towards farmers in that region. They tell me it is much better in the west, but then they always take a different approach to matters in the west. The people there <Col N="919" /> seem to get a better hearing when it comes to anything related to agriculture.</P>
    <P>When a person is certified unfit for work through long-term illness or whatever and is in receipt of an invalidity pension, he is summoned on a regular basis to appear before the medical referee for reassessment. Where medical evidence is submitted and is of a permanent nature, people should not be called before a medical referee on a regular basis. I know there are reasons for doing that in many cases, but it is done too frequently.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern to me is that there is no public transport available in rural areas, and since the national car testing scheme commenced, many people who depended on transport in rural areas are no longer car owners. That issue has to be examined. I appreciate my time is exhausted. I compliment the Minister on another good Social Welfare Bill. I hope he will take on board the points I made which will make a good situation better.</P>

      <P>The interest of all Members of the House in the Social Welfare Bill is understandable. I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward. I am sure everybody here agrees with most of what is contained in the Bill but our job is to highlight some of the problems that still exist and request action on them.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is like a long-playing record, as far as Deputy Ahern is concerned, but I must speak about the carer's allowance. It is time the Minster sat down with his colleague Deputy Martin, in the Department of Health and Children, and examined this problem as part of the overall approach towards care of the elderly. If a proper scheme is put in place and properly managed, the carer's allowance issue will play a major role in the care of the elderly into the next two or three decades when this issue will be one of the major problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>The income disregard and the current means test has not changed for years. That is unacceptable at a time when the economy is so strong. The Minister must address the question of the income disregard and examine the issue of the means test. I recognise that abandoning the means test will put a major financial burden on the State but I would point out to the Minister that many of the people being cared for in their own homes by their own families, who in some cases receive a modest carer's allowance or none at all, would cost the State a much higher level of expenditure if they had to be hospitalised in district hospitals. I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to dramatically changing the means test system for the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from recent discussions, which my <Col N="920" /> party, and I am sure other parties, had with the Carers Association, I ask the Minister to examine the position faced by old age pensioners and, in some cases, widows who are caring for disabled sons, daughters or other relatives. If they claim the carer's allowance and are carrying out full-time caring duties, they lose their original pension, be it old age or widow's. We have to do something for that group. There is a system whereby a person caring for two people can receive a 50% addition to the carer's allowance entitlement. If the person involved in the caring is already a social welfare recipient, we should try to put that system in place for that person. It is not an advantage for a person to give up the old age or widow's pension to take up the carer's allowance. Old age pensioners and widows or widowers who are also carers are the most disadvantaged and I ask the Minister to be more generous in terms of that sector.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the carer's benefit, which is an excellent idea, but I am sure all of us will be made aware of anomalies in that scheme over the coming months when the application forms are made available. I ask the Minister to also examine the position of people who gave up full-time employment a year to two years ago to provide full-time care and attention to a relative. Those people paid full PRSI for many years and, to the best of my knowledge from reading the legislation, they may not qualify now for carer's benefit. I hope it can be backdated in such a way that people who had sufficient insurance paid last year or the year before when they gave up work will qualify for the benefit. I agree with the comments made about the fuel allowance which requires attention from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill but I hope people on this side of the House are not wasting our time. This is an opportunity for the Opposition to highlight the inequalities in the Bill. The impression has been given by the Minister and the Government that they intend to eliminate social exclusion. I welcome and support that objective but how can they deal with a problem if they do not understand it? The people in this Government do not understand the problem of social exclusion or the difficulties being experienced by social welfare recipients. They are riding on the back of the Celtic tiger and they are enjoying every minute of it, backbenchers included. They are not aware of the problems of the people who are trying to catch the tail of the Celtic tiger. Old people, who lived through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and who handed this State to us, are being hounded. A directive from the Minister's office to crack down on social welfare&mdash;</P>

I was delighted to hear Deputy Aylward recognise the problem that we on this side of the House understand. The sooner there is a change of Government the sooner the people who handed down this State to us will be looked after. I see a smile on the Minister's face. He is listening and I hope his officials are listening. It annoys me intensely to see social welfare workers going around counting the eggs&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was. We made improvements but those improvements are now at a standstill. Unfortunately, with inflation, we are back to where we were. Where is this country going if we have social welfare officers going around counting the eggs on the dresser? Raising poultry is therapy for old people, a few hens and some chickens or turkeys for family members at Christmas. They have no income.</P>
      <P>It is time to recognise and appreciate the contribution of people in receipt of social welfare and old age pensions by giving them £100 per week across the board. We must stop investigating their means. What is £15,000 or £20,000 of savings? Does the Minister understand the mentality of an old person? They are saving for their final days, the rainy day or so they can be given a decent burial. Funerals at present can cost up to £8,000 in Dublin. There is also the cost of a burial plot and headstone. What is left? That is the mentality of these people. They do not wish to be a burden on their family or others and the Minister should recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that two other Deputies are waiting to make their contributions. There is so much to be said on the Bill that I regret it is being rushed through the House. It is an important debate. Another issue is the bus pass. It arrives through the letter box and is, supposedly, a big deal. What good is a bus pass in Cavan, Monaghan or other parts of rural Ireland when there is no bus passing the door? People may have a piece of paper but it takes them nowhere. However, there is a transport service provided by hackneys and taxis. Why does the Minister not extend the use of this bus pass? I am not seeking an open ended extension. Twice a week, for example, the bus pass could be used for a taxi or <Col N="922" /> hackney to take people to collect their pension or to their place of worship or to visit the doctor. If the Minister did that, I would be able to agree that he understands the problems of old people and is prepared to do something for them.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more to say but if the Minister takes this much on board, he will have made a good start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill. I am disappointed the Minister failed to tackle a number of the anomalies which Members on both sides of the House raised during the debate. With our buoyant economy we now have the opportunity to do so and bring balance into the system.</P>
      <P>The Department is anxious that lone parents improve their standard of education and, to this end, lone parents are eligible for the back to education allowance which applies to people participating in specific courses. Lone parents participating in these schemes continue to receive their lone parent payment and a cost of education allowance at the start of the academic year and they retain any entitlement they might have to secondary benefits such as rent allowance. However, a FÁS course is not a recognised course which qualifies for the back to education allowance.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the case of my constituent Yvonne, a lone parent who is participating on a foundation certificate course with FÁS. She is receiving a training allowance of £76.30 per week in addition to her one parent family payment of £88.70 per week. FÁS training allowances are assessed in full as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to rent supplement. There is no automatic retention of rent supplement. Yvonne's rent is £85 per week. She was entitled to rent supplement until she decided to go back into the education system. She is now financially better off to the tune of £6.30 per week. However, this does not take into account the cost of child care, transport, school materials and so forth. How can we claim to encourage the unemployed to train and upskill to gain employment when the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs discriminates against them?</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to discuss is the child dependant allowance for children between the ages of 18 and 22 years in full-time education. Frank is on unemployment benefit at present because his FÁS community employment scheme has ceased. He has a daughter attending a third level college but because he is not considered long-term unemployed by the Department he is not entitled to the child dependant allowance. Frank believed he was doing the right thing when he was paying his stamps. However, other people on the scheme had other ideas and they have ended up better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Minister discriminate against people who are long-term unemployed? When a person tries to retrain through a FÁS scheme, he <Col N="923" /> or she is discriminated against by the Department. How can we meet the skills shortages, fill job vacancies and reduce the number of long-term unemployed when people who take the initiative and try to break out of the unemployment cycle are knocked at every possible opportunity by the social welfare system?</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to deal with the carer's allowance. There are thousands of carers who, under the current regulations, are not eligible for the carer's allowance. The Minister has made some positive changes in this scheme in the past but to compensate for this, the Department has rigorously challenged the medical evidence submitted to it by utilising a policy of &ldquo;If in doubt, rule them out&rdquo;. Take the example of Marion's father who is doubly incontinent. She has been refused the carer's allowance as the Department claims he is not in need of full-time care. Margaret has two disabled children, one of whom is disabled following a car accident. She has been granted £3 per week for one son by the Department. It has questioned the need for care for the son who was involved in the car accident.</P>
    <P>The current system of medical assessment is inadequate. I fully endorse the comments of Deputy O'Shea on this issue. If a carer is unfortunate enough to lose their spouse, they lose the carer's allowance and are not entitled to social welfare payments. Deputy McCormack has elaborated on this issue. These people have an increased financial burden. They must try to survive without their spouse but were unable to work outside the home due to the need to care for another person in the home. They are left high and dry.</P>
    <P>Peggy is a widow and has to take care of her seriously disabled adult son. She provides 24 hour care, thus saving the State a small fortune for residential care. However, she receives no recognition from the State for this care. She has to get up between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. to bring her son to the bathroom. If she sleeps through due to exhaustion, when she gets up at 6 a.m. she is faced with a wet bed. She must then change and wash her son and change the bed. This mother and many others are committed to a lifetime of care, not just for a few years as is the case for most parents. She receives £76.50 per week.</P>
    <P>The system for the disabled is an all or nothing one. If they are within a service, the supports are provided but if a parent wishes to take care of their children, they receive no support. The current situation puts increased demand on residential care but this silent group of parents who are taking care of disabled children has been forgotten. I urge the Minister to reassess the situation and deal with discrimination in the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I was doing research recently and came across a staggering statistic with regard to the overall spend on social welfare. In the mid-<Col N="924" /> 1980s, when there was a considerable economic recession, there were three dependants for every person working. Today there are approximately 1.5 dependants for every person at work. While the graph in terms of spending is moving in the right direction, our relative capacity to pay more to people in need of social welfare is significantly greater than what we are delivering. Relative to our overall wealth, we are not distributing sufficient amounts to those most in need.</P>
      <P>That masks the fact that certain people are defrauding the system and claiming benefits to which they are not entitled. I welcome the Minister's efforts to tackle that. However, it is not matched on the other hand by increasing the payments to people who are desperately in need. Reference has been made, in particular, to single elderly people living alone. They are living on approximately £70 per week. That is an appalling amount.</P>
      <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, in his contribution on the Bill referred to social welfare officers in the constituency. I wish to dissociate myself from those comments. He accused the officers of harassing and criminalising applicants. I have received the utmost courtesy and co-operation from social welfare officials in the constituency. If these employees are asking questions, they are the questions which applicants for the schemes are obliged to answer.</P>
      <P>If there is a complaint in that regard, rather than shooting the messenger at constituency level, which is the local social welfare officer, Deputies would be better employed taking it up with the author of the schemes, namely, the Minister and his departmental officials. I found that especially offensive.</P>
      <P>I have raised previously the delays in dealing with applications. Huge additional responsibilities have been thrust on social welfare officers by changes in farm assist, the carer's allowance and other schemes, without additional resources. Applicants must wait six months or longer for decisions on their claims and that is unacceptable. There are charters of rights for patients and farmers. Perhaps there should be a charter of rights for social welfare recipients under which they would be entitled to a decision on their claim within a set time. There are undue delays in dealing with appeals in the Department. If a decision of a social welfare officer is appealed, it can take up to six months before a decision is made on the appeal. That is unacceptable. When there are declining numbers of people in receipt of unemployment assistance, it should be possible to speed up the decision-making process. I can instance numerous cases in my constituency where decisions submitted for appeal took up to six months to be decided upon. That is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other points I wish to make. The fuel allowance has been set at £5 for so long it is a joke. Perhaps the Minister will tackle that by tabling an amendment on Committee Stage. If people entirely dependent on the non-contribu<Col N="925" /> tory old age pension save something from it, they find on reassessment that the capital they have saved reduces their overall entitlement. That is the meanest form of penny pinching. If a person qualifies from the beginning because he or she has no resources and has not had any windfall gains, his or her savings from the pension, which is meagre enough, should not be used against them. There is an argument for a unit straddling the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Health and Children to deal with the carer's allowance and the nursing home subvention from health boards. It is something which should be examined because the level of subvention is a joke. People are disqualified from the carer's allowance because of spurious determination of means. Perhaps the Minister will examine the question of care of the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a caring one. The Minister cares for the underprivileged. I do not wish to say much because the Minister has everything under control. However, I would like to raise a few points. Regarding the widow's pension and widows about the age of 60 who live alone, if their late husbands were not entitled to free schemes, those widows are also not entitled to them. Perhaps the Minister will examine that at some stage to ensure that widows are cared for, especially when their families leave and they live on their own. They are not entitled to these schemes while others are and I would welcome a change in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about ESB meter readers. They pay the full rate of PRSI but are not entitled to benefits. I understand that in my area they are asked to take eight weeks off work because of cutbacks in the ESB. They will not qualify for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance because their contributions do not qualify them to claim those benefits. This is something which must be examined. The ESB is making an enormous amount of money and these people are not well paid for their work. If they live in rural areas, they often have to drive their cars on poor roads. Their motoring expenses for the year, taking into account tax, insurance and depreciation, are approximately £6,000.</P>
      <P>I welcome the £7 increase for old age pensioners. I also welcome the fact that the Minister has allowed them to have £10,000 in the bank without any means test being applied. If a person has £20,000 in the bank, he or she is assessed at £1 in every £1,000. This is a step in the right direction. Old people kept money in their homes because of the absence of this concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes the Minister has introduced to the carer's allowance are a credit to him. The allowance was introduced by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, when he held the portfolio and it has been much improved by the current Minister who is doing an excellent job. Where a carer lives within four miles of the person for whom he or she is caring, the carer <Col N="926" /> should be entitled to the allowance, especially if he or she is a son or daughter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed, especially those who made temperate remarks &ndash; there were some intemperate remarks which were unwarranted. One Opposition Deputy said I did not take one blind bit of notice of anything he said. That is not the case. Every representation made to me by a Member is treated in the same fashion, irrespective of which political party he or she is a member. Many Opposition Deputies will be able to confirm that any time they have approached me on any issue, I have always been amenable. There may be reasons I cannot do something and people should appreciate that and not make political capital out of it. I suppose we can all play politics with this issue. Deputy Boylan, who has been a Member of the House longer than I have, tried to make out that the system of social welfare inspectors has dramatically changed since I became Minister and that they are in some way becoming much more aggressive. That is not the case. They do their job irrespective of what Government is in power or what Minister is in office. I am surprised someone with Deputy Boylan's experience would say such a thing.</P>
      <P>Many Opposition Deputies referred to the fact that we have endless amounts of money and that we can do many things. These are the same Deputies who cried over the years that the economy was going down the tubes and that we were spending beyond our means. Even the least objective Opposition Deputy would acknowledge that when times are good we must be more prudent with taxpayers' money than when times are bad in that it is acknowledged that the rainy day will come. We must strike a balance between caring for those who are less well off and looking to the future, and the Government has done that.</P>
      <P>The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the epitome of the outlook of this Administration for the next three years. I assure Deputies it will be this Government which will deliver on the vast majority of the proposals in that programme. In the area of social inclusion alone, £1.5 billion will be put in place over the next two years and nine months from the start of the agreement. The amount put in place under Partnership 2000, which was negotiated by the main Opposition parties when they were in Government, was only £525 million over a three year period.</P>
      <P>More than three times the amount for social inclusion will be made available in the new partnership arrangement.</P>

He provided £100 million for carers in the Department's Estimates that year. When I took office £35 million per annum was being spent in this area.

      <P>There has been a 60% increase in the number of people in receipt of that allowance since I took office. Some 15,000 carers were in receipt of that allowance at the end of January 2000, 80% of whom receive the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>The issue of paying the carer's allowance to a person in receipt of another social welfare payment was examined by the review group. Most Deputies raised the issue of the carer's allowance but I would hazard a guess that most of them have not read the carer's review which took place about a year ago. I suggest they read the review which explains in detail all the aspects of that allowance. The means test for the carer's allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system in terms of assessment of household income. I compliment Deputies on the opposite side of the House for raising this issue. Deputy Creed said there should be a better connection between health board subvention, the carer's allowance and the home help scheme. Deputy Crawford asked me last week to discuss this matter with the Minister for Health and Children. I discussed the matter with him. It is an area which requires medium and long-term discussion because it will remain on our agenda irrespective of who is in office.</P>
      <P>The issue of a person receiving two payments was raised by a number of Deputies. This matter has been causing some difficulty. Deputy McCormack said I do not take a blind bit of notice of what he says. That is not the case. I responded to him on each occasion that he raised this issue.</P>

      <P>This issue was discussed by the joint committee. The example given by Deputy McCormack was that of a woman in receipt of the carer's allowance who on becoming widowed qualifies for the widow's pension and loses that allowance. This policy is in keeping with the primary objective of the social welfare system which is to provide income support. As a general rule only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. Deputy McCormack perceives widows to be a specific and worthy category who should receive two social welfare payments. We can all empathise with that but it would be difficult to justify paying two payments to widows and not to old age pensioners, lone parents and other groups who are equally entitled to such treatment. Where would we stop?</P>

      <P>The allowance was never intended to be a compensatory payment for earnings foregone nor as a payment by the State for services rendered nor could it ever be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Some Members questioned why it is not being introduced until October. Again, those who raised that point do not understand the system. We have to change the employment legislation to protect people's rights so we could not introduce it any earlier. Deputies profess some ignorance in that respect. I obtained Cabinet approval to extend the period of payment of the carer's benefit from 12 months to 15 months to bring it into line with similar schemes. We looked at the possibility of extending it for a longer period but, because of the difficulty of retaining employment rights over a period of 15 months, a compromise was reached.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of child benefit. This year's child benefit package was the largest in the history of this State. It increased the budget spent in this area by 25% in one year to £106 million to bring it up to £775 million. Deputies McGrath and Noel Ahern raised the issue of a single rate for all children. The reason for more than one rate is that it is accepted that families with greater numbers of children are at greater risk of poverty than smaller ones. This is why the payment is weighted in favour of larger families.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to changes in capital assessment and stated that in his opinion persons with capital of £30,000 would be heavily penalised. He is wrong. Anybody with £10,000 or less will no longer, as Deputy Brennan said earlier, have their capital assessed. This accounts for 88% of all old age pensioners. A married old age pensioner with a qualified adult dependant who has capital of £40,000 would have an effective assessment rate of 1.3% on their capital and will gain up to £24 per week as a result of the changes made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Deputy McGrath asked why we did not rationalise the rates of child dependant increases. I, with the previous Government, have been reluctant to increase child dependant allowances; we have concentrated on increasing child benefit. The loss of child benefit by social welfare recipients taking up employment can act as a disincentive to their taking up available work opportunities. I am disappointed with some of the comments made by Deputies, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin in particular, about PRSI improvements. Is she suggesting that a measure which will benefit 460,000 employees who will gain about £5.60 a week should not be introduced?</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin lectured us about spin doctoring. I would hazard a guess that his party are past masters at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>He said our figures on this were wrong. Deputy Ó Caoláin should recheck his information. If he has any difficulty doing so he can check with my officials. His figures are wrong. Approximately 660,000 people will benefit as a result of the PRSI and health contribution levy changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People on low income will gain a minimum of £12 extra per week as a result of the negotiations <Col N="930" /> on the new partnership agreement. They will gain extra money on top of the £12 as a result of tax changes in the budget and measures which I am introducing in this Bill. People on the basic low income will receive a minimum of £20 extra per week as a result of all those changes.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned this Social Welfare Bill and the new partnership agreement herald a new era for people on low income. This Government will deliver the commitments in the new agreement in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday 15 February, the Government endorsed an integrated package of changes to the existing statutory approval and judicial review processes in order to underpin accelerated delivery of infrastructure under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>These measures were presented to the Government by the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and include proposals for improvements to existing processes from the design to the delivery stages. Changes will be made in respect of the planning process, the Planning Bill, judicial review and courts related issues. The committee was assisted in drawing up its recommendations by a cross-departmental team.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for a copy of the press release outlining the measures to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Taoiseach to say that a copy of the press release will be laid before the Houses, or did he say a copy of the full decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A copy of which?</P>

    <Col N="933" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not hear the Taoiseach correctly, but I thought he said towards the end of his reply that a copy of the press release outlining the contents of the committee's report would be made available. Are we talking about a press release or the full text of the decision that was made by the Cabinet?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that comprehensive proposals were made and that it appears comprehensive decisions were taken by the Cabinet? There was a press release in the newspapers which said that High Court access and time limits in relation to planning procedures would be streamlined but we do not have the precise details, which is what we want to see. What is now in the public domain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The document I have is headed &ldquo;press release&rdquo;. I assume this was made public. It gives all the issues and is a fairly long document. It includes, in some detail, all the operational improvements to the planning process, gives the provisions of the Planning Bill in relation to judicial review and spells out the court related issues and the constitutional issues. I think that is in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that full document will become available.</P>
      <P>Can I take, from what the Taoiseach said today and on a previous occasion, that legislative change, other than the amendments to the existing Planning Bill, is not contemplated? In other words, the provision of a special High Court section to deal with disputes relating to property arising from road widening and motorway schemes can be implemented without legislative change.</P>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that the motorways Acts do not need to be amended to have, for example, one single set of public hearings, one environmental impact study and so on for the completion of the motorway scheme from Dublin to Limerick and Cork, rather than doing it on a county by county basis as is currently the case? Will the Taoiseach outline, if he has the information &ndash; and, if not, will he make it available to me &ndash; what legislative changes, if any, will arise on foot of the decisions made by the Cabinet last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the judicial review area, the Planning Bill must be amended to include a clear legislative direction that the High Court should deal with applications for proceedings. Provision is to be included in the Planning Bill that the applicant for judicial review be required to have previously shown an interest in a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts related issues do not require legislation but the Courts Service is to be asked by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine ways of speeding up the processing of legal proceedings in relation to major infrastructural projects. These include the listing of signifi<Col N="934" /> cant planning infrastructure cases for judicial review separately from other cases; putting in place an arrangement under which the President of the High Court may, from time to time, assign a judge to the hearing of significant planning infrastructural cases, so that that judge would specialise in those cases; the aim of putting agreed arrangements in place by this May; and the establishment of a separate division of the High Court to deal with planning and infrastructural issues in the light of the experience of the next 12 months. They will see if it is possible for the President of the High Court to put somebody in position. They believe that will succeed. If it does not, there will then be a division of the High Court. That does not require legislative changes.</P>
    <P>Other aspects in the document concern the Planning Bill, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Roads Authority. These include a code of practice governing the procedures in relation to archaeological licences for road projects, which is to be ready by the end of March. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources are to come to a decision on the process involving the national roads affecting the foreshore, where there is a number of issues and projects.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is to assume sole responsibility for route selection, which relates to the Deputy's question, on the core roads where this is clearly necessary and where significant reductions in delays and costs may be expected. As I understand it, the toll roads legislation does not require change. The objections can be taken in one bloc. The Attorney General has looked in detail at this issue. I have not seen his fine report, which the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been looking at in the context of the Planning Bill. However, subject to correction, I understand they can do that. It is the intention to do it, either with amendment, if it is required, or without amendment if it is not required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give a precise example of what I mean, which might be of some remote interest to you, a Cheann Comhairle. The NRA recently came down in favour of a route for the N9, which will run from the Kilcullen end of the motorway to Waterford city. Under the present system, in order for that to go through the planning process, four separate local authorities would have to conduct four separate public inquiries, public hearings, environmental impact studies and assessments, all subject to separate judicial review. It would be the Glen of the Downs multiplied by one hundred. Will any of the decisions made by the Government in the past ten days bring about a situation where there will be one public hearing, one planning study, one environmental impact study, one environmental impact assessment and one legal process that would deal with the completion of the N9 from Kilcullen to Waterford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="935" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The changes in procedures, the cross-departmental team's work, the additional agreements with the NRA and the legislative change in the planning Bill are all designed to deal with that procedure, as instructed by the Attorney General. The objective is that there would be one inquiry and one application, and that the NRA would be able to make a decision on its own as the current process is cumbersome. The Deputy and I favour a process which considers roads which go from A to Z, rather than a series of bypasses. The intention is that national roads will take a straight route and there will be one design and one application. That is the only way we will generate substantial interest in PPPs and attract much needed design teams from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. The cross-departmental team also put forward suggestions on other issues but it is mainly concerned with infrastructure. The committee is dealing with the institutional and administrative arrangements for the delivery of public transport, the administrative arrangements for the implementation of national roads projects, institutional arrangements for transport in the greater Dublin area, the recommendations on the statutory approval and judicial review processes and the development and implementation of the communications strategy. We are not dealing with the development of housing but the national roads plan and the national <Col N="936" /> development plan will assist in dealing with these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that we have a housing crisis as far as affordable housing is concerned? Does he also agree that the current approach of each housing application being considered separately, without reference to existing infrastructural provisions and perhaps with reference to a development plan which is six years old, is not leading to the rapid provision of the kind of housing necessary to meet the urgent needs?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different area. We are discussing the cross-departmental team on infrastructure which is not yet building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for this issue. We are building 50,000 houses this year. The planning process and procedures require that each application is examined. People have a right to appeal and to object. Land must be zoned and the development plans should be up to date, as they are in most councils. These plans must be adhered to. The infrastructure around these plans is an essential element.</P>
      <P>The infrastructural committee is working on the road and rail networks to ensure that we have modern and efficient transport so that by the end of the plan in 2006, after £41 billion has been spent on infrastructural development, journey times will be far less than at present. I am not going to get into the questions on housing policy, which are matters for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as that does not relate to this question.</P>

Does he also agree that it does not make sense to talk about housing policy in isolation from transport or amenity development policy?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has distributed approximately 450 copies of Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme of Regulatory Reform in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulatory reform is an important element of the Strategic Management Initiative and is a central theme of Delivering Better Government. As part of the Strategic Management Initiative, a working group on regulatory reform was established in September 1996 and was chaired by the <Col N="939" /> Secretary General of the then Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the working group were submitted to and accepted by Government in June 1999. Based on those recommendations the action programme Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme of Regulatory Reform in Ireland was published in July 1999.</P>
    <P>I launched the programme in Dublin Castle on 22 July 1999 as part of the latest phase of the Strategic Management Initiative and the Deputy was present on that occasion. The document Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme of Regulatory Reform in Ireland was included in the information pack which was given out that day to all in attendance. The invitation list included Ministers and Ministers of State, Secretaries General, the Regulatory Reform Working Group and other SMI working groups, personnel officers, customer service officers and SMI facilitators. The document was also sent to the senior managers in each Government Department and office who have responsibility for regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the action programme is under way and I am glad to inform the Deputy that the OECD has agreed to include Ireland in its Programme of Country Reviews of Regulatory Reform for 2000. This review will provide the basis for further developing and deepening the regulatory reform process in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the distribution list. The proposals concerned the consolidation, revision and repeal of regulations. Seven action points were set out and each Department and office was to consult with all customers and other interested parties to prioritise regulatory reform. Each Department and office was also to list its regulations to identify the scope for reform. In that process it was their obligation to talk to customers and other agencies, not only about current legislation but about new legislation. While only 450 copies of the document were circulated, it was to be followed up everywhere it had a relevant use. I assume that is what happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In new legislation, directives or amendments of regulations the document is given to the Minister and his officials to prevent additional burdens being placed on small businesses or other bodies. That has an effect because people are forced to look at that additional burden. Examination of existing legislation is ongoing and will take some time. The Secretaries General are trying to look at all the regulations to identify the scope for reform but that is an <Col N="940" /> enormous job. In time many regulations could be dropped.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, those involved have not finished their work. They have outlined the principles which will underpin regulatory reform. They say that in all decisions we should improve the quality rather than the quantity of regulations, which is welcome, they are eliminating unnecessary or inefficient regulations, including legislation, and simplifying necessary regulation and related procedures as far as possible. They are doing that to lower the cost of regulatory compliance and to make regulations more accessible to the public while, in each case, protecting the public interest.</P>
      <P>They are succeeding with new legislation but for old legislation this is an enormous task. They are trying to revisit all existing regulations, list the areas where there is red tape and then reforming those areas. This had been under way for three and a half years and will take some time yet. They have opened their processes up to the OECD. Included in their list is what we do in this House every day without looking at the complete picture &ndash; we place a huge administrative burden on people year after year.</P>

      <P>It has looked at our own administrative arrangements and legislation. It also looked at Civil Service handbooks, and at the codes of behaviour and standards built up for the Civil Service up to and including the SMI initiative, Delivering Better Government. It is also trying to introduce proposals that reflect what we have done legislatively through the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Public Service Management Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act and the standards in public office Bill, which is being drafted at present. It has also looked at Government handbooks, the Ombudsman guide to best practice and the quality customer service initiative and has tried to put together a modern code that will set a guideline for all civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is unsatisfactory that former planning officers employed by the grossly understaffed planning departments of many county councils are turning up as planning consultants within a short time after retirement or prematurely leaving their jobs? They earn substantially more in the private sector dealing with their former workmates. Does he not agree that the State has a certain amount of intellectual property in the expertise it allows people to gain while in its employment and that it has a right to some form of lien on that property? These are genuine issues, although one <Col N="942" /> would not wish to push them too far. At a time of overheating in the economy we run the serious risk of denuding the public service of key talent through financial incentives which allow those people to use, to their individual profit, their intellectual property provided to them by the State at great expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying purpose of this code is in the first instance to try to make explicit the core values and behaviour requirements in the Civil Service at all levels, to identify further values to help civil servants to manage the environment of deepening change and to set out an unambiguous framework of standards, behaviours and values which will be a reference for all civil servants when undertaking their work into the future. This probably covers Deputy Bruton's concerns because it deals with the future. Had it been raised five years ago it may have been argued that the concerns it sought to address were hypothetical. That is not the case today, because if my information is three quarters correct, civil servants who leave now, even at senior level, can earn three times what we can give them. While that applies to limited numbers, it is the reality. It is a matter of concern. I am not sure much can be done about it, although this will be discussed by this group and it is something the Government has discussed. When people leave they have completed their employment and I am not sure anything can be done about that.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy's point on the intellectual property built up by the State is correct. A person can leave the State's employment and advise others who are opposed to State policy. It happens in many areas, including in my own profession of accountancy and related tax areas. Many of the people with whom I studied tax 23 or 24 years ago and who worked in the Revenue are now some of the leading experts on tax issues working on the other side of the fence. I am not sure if it is possible to do anything about these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the rigidities within the public sector pay system and I raised the question about the CSSO and the NTMA model last week. Does the Taoiseach not agree with Deputy Bruton that an impediment could be imposed on a process whereby a person taking retirement from a county council planning department in his early fifties will do so on the clear understanding with the county manager that when he leaves on a Friday on a certain salary he will not then be recruited by the planning department as a consultant the following Monday with a salary that is a multiple of two or three times his salary on retirement? Surely this type of system is fuelling overheating of the economy and there must be ways of avoiding it. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest this is happening, but the factual evidence will never be obtained to substantiate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is happening in the planning area all over the country. In the Civil Service code an attempt is being made to establish an unambiguous framework of standards, behaviours and values which will be a reference for all civil servants in undertaking their work for the future. In compiling it, the group can look at the terms of employment of civil servants and whatever other standards are relevant. Nothing can be done in circumstances where people retire or finish their duty, or where the seven year rule is operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would this problem not be more productively addressed from the angle of the intellectual property of the State rather than ethics? While it is very difficult to establish if there is anything ethically wrong in somebody moving from one employment to another, there is a case for saying that there is intellectual property in the ownership of the State. For example, members of the press corps in Brussels can claim ownership of intellectual property with regard to the questions they ask at press briefings and they can object to these being disseminated on the web to newspapers offices at home on the grounds that they, as experts in Brussels, have intellectual property in the questions they ask. Surely the concept of intellectual property is now extended to the point that the State could similarly claim some intellectual property in the training it gives to planning officers, tax inspectors and senior people in various fields where there is a very active private market in similar skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Bruton is right to say we could look at this matter from the perspective of intellectual property. It may mean getting involved in a very intellectual argument about whether implementation could be enforced. The issue is being looked at, but it has not been included in this code because it is concerned with serving civil servants. While the matter is under discussion, it does not cover the aspects mentioned by the Deputy. I doubt if it would be possible to implement what he suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The negotiations on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness concluded with a plenary meeting in Government Buildings on Monday, 7 February last. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Finance and I took part along with the social partners &ndash; representing employers, trade unions, farmers and the community and voluntary sector. In the course of my remarks on this occasion, I recalled the impressive record of achievement of social partnership to date, both in bringing about the much needed recovery from the disastrous early and middle 1980s and in underpinning a period of sustained growth since then. I also emphasised the Government's view that the new programme is fundamental to ensuring continuing economic success and to building a fair and prosperous society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had direct contact with the social partners since the launch of the programme. The organisations concerned are currently in the process of seeking to secure its ratification and they <Col N="945" /> have to be given the time and space to do that. However, I took the opportunity in the course of the statements in the House last week to address some of the concerns which have been expressed about the pay terms of the new programme. That, on the one hand, concerns have been expressed that the new programme offers too much in terms of pay and, on the other, that it does not offer enough, shows that in reality this is a balanced agreement. As we know from experience, the one sure-fire way to ensuring the worst fears of proponents of both views are realised would be to abandon the partnership approach and embark on a free for all. Some of those most active in opposing the agreement have always opposed these agreements, many on purely ideological grounds. Most people are sensible enough to see through that and to recognise the value of continuing the partnership model.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said in the House last week that the very substantial pay increases which the programme produced, and our overall prosperity, require adherence to the pay terms of the programme. As I said then, the Government for its part has lived up to, and will continue to live up to, its commitments, but equally pay developments in the public service, the private sector and commercial State companies must be consistent with Partnership 2000 and with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, if ratified.</P>
    <P>I gave a detailed overview of the programme in my statement last week and I do not propose to go over it again. I would simply repeat that the Government firmly believes the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides the best possible grounding for further economic and social progress. It deserves support as a balanced outcome to wide-ranging and intensive negotiations with the social partner organisations. I look forward to a positive outcome to the process of ratifying the agreement and to working closely with the social partners in implementing the programme in the period ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any of the social partners expressed concern to the Taoiseach at the fact that inflation is running at about 4.4%, a good deal higher than the rate even at the time the agreement was finalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no detailed discussions with the partners since the meeting on 7 February. I think the Deputy knows my view on inflation. Over the period of the programme, 2000 to 2002, the projected rate will be between 2% and 2.55%. Within his powers, the Minister for Finance must take whatever measures are appropriate to ensure that inflation limit is maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions should be directed to the Minister for Finance. All our powers are not gone. Deputies can see what we did in our fiscal policies this year. Inflation is high because of the price of oil and the increase in the cost of cigarettes. If these were taken out of the equation our rate of inflation would be about 2.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach suggesting we might reduce the price of cigarettes next year to reduce inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We made the decision to increase the price of cigarettes for good health reasons and I hope it will prove successful over time. As Deputy Bruton knows, price stability is created not just by exchange rate policy, but by confidence in the economy and control of public expenditure. Taxation measures can be taken if necessary to keep inflation down. Estimates by independent economists indicate that inflation will peak later this year and we will then move back to a rate of around 2.5% for the life of the programme. We must always keep a careful watch on inflation. I will not say I do not care about inflation as that would be irresponsible. We must be careful and reflective on an ongoing basis in terms of price stability and this is the role of the Central Bank as part of the European Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree all evidence suggests that no matter how much the price of cigarettes is increased it does not appear to have any impact on consumption patterns, and that if anything it has a greater impact on smuggling patterns? Did the Minister for Finance not have available to him what was available to previous Ministers for Finance, including myself, namely, a very clear indication that an increase of 50p in the price of tobacco would have a very discernible impact on inflation in the current year, given the basket of commodities in the CPI? Having regard to these two points, the fact that the Government did not need the additional revenue and that the increase will not affect health, why did the Government knowingly jeopardise the ratification by the social partners, particularly the trade union members, of the current agreement by unnecessarily increasing the rate of inflation? Did the Minister for Finance tell the Taoiseach he was going to do this anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the figures were available and the Government knowingly made the decision taking into account the CPI factor. It does not follow that people will pay any price for cigarettes and that consumption will not decrease. Evidence from other countries indicates that the level of smoking is decreasing, although <Col N="947" /> perhaps this is not indicated among younger people. The evidence is that smoking kills people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Smoking has increased in the UK and revenue has decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I think it is fair to generate revenue through taxation on cigarettes. People who smoke pay higher taxes which are used to finance the health system, and I see nothing wrong with this. If I disregarded the CPI context, I would have probably introduced a larger increase &ndash; perhaps 15p or 20p &ndash; six or seven years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It just increases illegal smuggling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be a disproportionate increase next year in the price of cigarettes for health reasons, will the Taoiseach consider reducing some other indirect taxes by an equivalent CPI amount &ndash; petrol would have been a good option this year &ndash; so that there is a neutral CPI effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something to keep in mind. We contemplated doing that this year, but decided not to. It could be done on an excise rather than a VAT basis, something which is open to the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>

      <Quest>the response of the European Union to the case made that the contract to deliver social welfare payments should be put out to tender; if the contract with An Post which expired on 31 December 1999 will now be renewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract under which An Post provides the payments delivery service to my Department reached the end of its term on 31 December last. The Government had previously decided that the term of this contract should be extended for a further three years, namely, 2000 to 2002 inclusive.</P>
      <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract have been raised with the EU Commission by a third party which feels aggrieved by the Government's decision. In accordance with its usual practice in these matters, the Commission referred these complaints to my Department for its observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responses to complaints, and the complex legal issues upon which they are based, have been sent to the Commission. I understand the Commission is currently examining the arguments advanced by the complainant and the obser<Col N="948" /> vations supplied by my Department. As part of this process, the Commission has recently sought some additional clarification of the basis upon which the decision was made. This additional information is being compiled by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise and will be supplied to the Commission as soon as possible. It follows that the Commission has not yet reached a definitive view of the merits of the arguments which have been advanced by the complainant in this matter.</P>
    <P>The necessity to address and resolve the issues raised with the EU Commission has delayed the completion of a new three year contract with An Post. In the meantime, recognising that the payments delivery service which An Post provides to my Department's customers must continue without interruption, my Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide these services on an interim basis. The Commission has been notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have already re-iterated the Government's commitment to maintain a network of post offices. While not wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the issues being considered by the EU Commission, I am confident that An Post will continue to have an important role in the delivery of services for my Department. Needless to say, the Government intends to fully comply with its EU obligations in this matter, once they have been definitively established.</P>

Does he agree that the arguments he used in 1998 to put the contract out to tender are being used against him and that this may be a fatal weakness in the case before the Commission? When was the objection lodged with the Commission and by whom? When was the response to it filed by his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that I argued one way or the other. The Government made a decision on this matter based on the legal advice it had received from the Attorney General on this issue. As I stated on previous occasions, this issue is a poisoned chalice which was passed to the Government because the previous Government, of which the Deputy was a member, passed the buck. It included a stipulation in the previous decision that the contract would be renewed for three years on condition that it would be put out to tender at the end of that period, which was 1999. The Government dealt with that provision on the basis of legal advice from the previous Attorney General and it has subsequently been confirmed by the current Attorney General that we are legally entitled to do that. He also obtained independent legal advice in this regard. The Government and I are entitled to do what we are doing and I categorically deny that I argued one way or the other. I stated the facts to the Government. At the end of the day, the <Col N="949" /> Government made the decision and Deputy O'Keeffe, who comes from a rural area, should consider that to be a correct decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern relates to the rural sub-post office network which has been put at risk by the Minister. Does he deny that at a meeting in September 1998 he argued with the Minister for Public Enterprise that he was obliged to put the contract out to tender under EU procurement regulations and that in any event he wanted to save money, and that it was only after a political row that the Government made a U-turn prior to the elections? Does he accept he has put his present position at risk? Why did his Department participate in a recent trial electronic payments method in Ennis? Why was An Post not part of the trial? Is that not a further indication of the Minister's lack of faith in An Post and lack of concern for the rural sub-post office network?</P>

We were requested to become involved in the promotion of Ennis as an information age town and that was one of the initiatives that was adopted. An Post was invited but declined. The Deputy referred to an argument I made at a particular meeting but he seems to have changed his tune. He previously quoted what he stated was the minute of a meeting, but it was only a memorandum made available to me prior to the meeting.</P>

      <Quest>the projected income and expenditure of the social insurance fund in each of the years from 2000 to 2002 and the likely surplus in each of these years.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The data requested by the Deputy are contained in a following tabular statement. The table shows that the social insurance surplus is projected to be £198 million in 2000. However, the figures for potential surpluses contained in the table for 2001 and 2002 do not take into account increases in excess of prices inflation, in the rates of social insurance benefits and pensions, which may be introduced in those years. In this regard, the Government is already committed to raising the maximum personal rates of the lowest old age pensions to a figure of £100 per week by 2002. In addition, the Government has entered a commitment with the social partners as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to increase the rates of all social welfare payments in real terms over the lifetime of the programme and to make substantial progress towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates over the period of the programme. Clearly, these and other developments are likely to have a significant impact on any emerging surpluses over the next two years.</P>
      <P>PRSI income is currently buoyant due to the increased numbers of persons in the workforce and the economic climate generally. The availability of social insurance fund resources has enabled me to widen the contingencies covered by the social insurance system. The Social Welfare Bill provides, among other provisions, for the introduction of a carer's benefit which will be paid, without a means test, to all workers who are required to take time out of the workforce to provide full time care and attention for incapacitated persons. This is an innovative enhancement of the social insurance system and will be of significant value to all workers who have to balance work responsibilities with their responsibilities to care for persons who are sick or incapacitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the financial position of the fund is secure in the short-term, significant funding challenges lie ahead in the medium and long-term. These arise mainly from the increase in the numbers of older persons in society, the majority of whom will be entitled to a pension paid from the fund. The Government decision to set up a reserve fund to part pre-fund social welfare pensions in the long-term represents a significant commitment by the Exchequer towards ensuring <Col N="951" /> pensions will be paid in the future. The current social insurance fund surplus will play an important role in the financing of projected growth in social insurance expenditure in the medium term as well as improvements in the rate and range of benefits provided.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to safeguarding the fund and to the enhancement of the social insurance system so that it continues to be a key component in the delivery of social protection in this country in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Can I take it the increase in the net surplus figures for the social insurance fund from £107 million to £232 million in 1999 to £148 million to £257 million in 2002 are out of date and have been overtaken by the changes made by the Minister? The Minister referred to a surplus of £198 million for 2000. Can the Government be trusted with the administration of the social insurance fund given that a significant proportion of it is bitterly hostile to the entire concept? Many commentators feel that in the Social Welfare Bill and the fourth or fifth budget for 2000 the Minister has raided the social insurance fund to counter balance the mistakes made by the Minister for Finance before Christmas. In three or four years' time, there could be an insurance fund surplus of up to £1 billion but, because of the Minister's policies, it will be much smaller and the possibilities of developing it in the context of the national development plan will be lessened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In early 1998 my Department accepted an invitation from the Garda to participate in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints. These checkpoints involve staff from my Department <Col N="953" /> participating with the Garda and officials of the Department of Public Enterprise, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in checking for compliance with the law in each of the areas concerned. The checkpoints proved to be effective in identifying areas of potential abuse which could be subsequently followed up. To copperfasten the legal basis of these operations, provision was included in the 1999 Social Welfare Act to provide specific legal cover for officers of my Department participating in these checkpoints.</P>
      <P>Inspectors from my Department participated in 15 checkpoints in 1998 and four during 1999. A number of issues relating to the operation of the checkpoints has been raised on behalf of the staff involved in them and these are under discussion with the trade union concerned. In the meantime, checkpoints involving staff from my Department have not been set up this year. Due to the necessity for a Garda presence in these exercises, the scheduling of checkpoints also depends on the availability of gardaí, having regard to their other commitments and the other activities in which they are engaged.</P>
      <P>I regard the multi-agency vehicle checkpoints as an effective anti-abuse measure and, when the issues currently under discussion have been resolved, my Department will continue, as circumstances allow, to participate in vehicle checkpoints as one, but not only one element of its programme of activities to control fraud and abuse of social welfare payments. These activities include claim reviews, employer visitation for the purpose of inspecting PRSI records, data matching and other computer trawling exercises, liaison and transfer of information with other agencies in accordance with the law and special intensive team review activities on a local basis.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the rather odd situation where most of the checkpoints seem to have occurred prior to the passing of the 1999 Social Welfare Act which conferred the power to run them? It seems very odd that, on the basis of the figures the Minister presented to us, most of the checkpoints were in operation before the Act became law and that only a few have been in operation since then. What is the reason for that and what are the Minister's future intentions in regard to these checkpoints?</P>

      <P>I stated that as far as I am concerned the checkpoints will comprise one element of the Department's attempt to stamp out fraud. Fewer checkpoints have been in operation since the passing of the legislation because the scheme was originally set up on a pilot basis. The Garda, as a result of international contacts and experience, decided to set up these checkpoints which apparently work very effectively in the UK and other European countries. We were asked to participate in the checkpoints in early 1998, together with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="954" /> Government and the Revenue Commissioners. The trade union involved in my Department has raised issues in regard to health and safety which are ongoing. A meeting is due to be held in the coming weeks in an attempt to finalise those issues. Once they are resolved, we will continue to participate in the checkpoints.</P>

Is that the case? I also understand that the trade unions have submitted a claim to the effect that involvement with these agencies should be recognised as a new duty and that no further checkpoints will operated out until this issue is clarified.

      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme will operate this year from 1 June to 30 September during which approved students will be allowed to undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour. The scheme is, therefore, essentially the same as last year with the exception that this year students will be allowed to undertake work in September which was precluded under the 1999 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Union of Students of Ireland has over the years raised various issues about the operation of the scheme. These issues mainly concern the <Col N="955" /> number of hours available to students, the rate of pay and the application of the means test for qualification under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme was not designed to compete with jobs on offer in the open labour market. It is a scheme based on community work and I am satisfied that the rate of pay on offer adequately reflects the nature of and conditions attaching to the type of work being undertaken by the students. I am also conscious of the tightening labour market and the greater availability of work during the summer in the open labour market. For this reason, I do not propose to increase the number of hours available to students under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Demand for places under the scheme has been steadily declining over the past three years. In 1999, for example, 9,200 students participated in the scheme. This was a reduction of 32% on the participation level in 1998. This declining trend has been evident since 1997 and I expect it to continue again this year due to the availability of jobs in the summer months, especially in the services and tourism sectors.</P>
    <P>The Union of Students in Ireland has also raised the issue of the abolition of the means test. The primary aim of the scheme is to provide financial help to those less well-off students who are unable to get summer jobs and who are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period. The abolition of the means test would change the whole nature of the scheme and would impact adversely on the resources available to help those students who need it most. The focus of the scheme will, therefore, remain on students from low income families.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been very successful in recent years and has helped both local communities and the students themselves. In recent years, however, improving economic conditions have reduced the demand for places under the scheme. In spite of this, I intend to continue to operate the scheme for as long as it appears to have a worthwhile role to play in local communities and for the less well-off students in terms of providing them with an income and with valuable work experience which they would not otherwise be able to acquire.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that this has been a good scheme and does he think it would be wise to discuss its future with the Union of Students in Ireland who represent the students concerned? Am I correct in saying that the rate of pay has not been increased since 1995 when it was set at £3 per hour? The world has changed since 1995 and, in view of the impending introduction of the minimum wage, does the Minister agree there is a case for increasing the rate of payment to the minimum wage level? </P>

      <P>I do not have the figures in regard to the most recent increase of the rate of <Col N="956" /> payment and the Deputy could be correct in what he is saying. I will obtain the figures and communicate them to him.</P>
      <P>This scheme was designed to assist low income families and students. I hear a great deal of public comment to the effect that all students should qualify for the scheme but that is not what the scheme was designed for. It was designed for students who did not qualify for unemployment assistance in the summer because they were not available for full-time work. It worked well in times of high unemployment, when there was more deprivation in our society. Times have changed and with labour market shortages, particularly in the tourism industry which is crying out for staff, students are able to avail of better opportunities than those provided by the scheme. The figures speak for themselves. In 1996, 15,700 took up jobs under the scheme compared to 9,200 in 1999, which was a reduction from 13,600 the previous year. This is a phenomenal reduction due to shortages in the labour market which mean there are more opportunities for students to get work at a better rate of pay and in many cases in better conditions.</P>

Does he agree that a review of the hourly rate &ndash; students should receive the minimum wage &ndash; the number of hours and the means test is justified?

      <Quest>if he has reviewed the possibility of paying a uniform rate of child dependant allowance; and when this uniform rate will be implemented.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6205/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three different rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, ranging from £13.20 per week to £17 per week. The reasons for this are largely historical. There has been considerable rationalisation of rates over the years, in line with a recommendation made by the Commission on Social Welfare. The number of different rates has been reduced from 36 at the time the commission reported in 1986 to the current three. Further rationalisation would be extremely costly. The full year cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £44.5 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. The policy direction followed by the Government has, therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit &ndash; this is no different from the policy of previous Governments. Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. The 1999 budget provided for a full year investment of over £40 million in the scheme, while the 2000 budget provides for a full year investment of almost £106 million, which will bring the total investment in the scheme up to £575 million. Investment in the child benefit scheme represents the most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</P>

Does the Minister agree it is ridiculous that children in the same category receive different rates of child dependant allowance? The child dependant allowance rates have not changed since 1994, unlike all other social welfare payments which have been substantially increased. Does the Minister agree it is unreasonable and unfair to have different rates of payment which have not increased as have other benefits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No one likes to see different rates of social welfare payments, which is one of the reasons previous Governments of various hues have tried to reduce the number of rates in this area. Deputy McGrath is right that the payments have not changed since 1994. This is <Col N="958" /> because the then Government, of one of whose parties the Deputy was a member, decided it would be better to freeze the allowance and invest available money in child benefit. When I entered office I looked at this and decided in my first budget, and successive ones, that this was a correct policy on the basis that the loss of child dependant allowance acts as a gross disincentive for people to take up employment. Investing in child benefit means people do not lose it, irrespective of whether they work. It would cost £45 million to bring all the payments up to one rate. This would be better invested in increased child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying he is not prepared to spend £44 million on the child dependant allowance, notwithstanding the fact that we have the highest level of child poverty in Europe. Increasing the child dependant allowance would go a long way towards changing this. This issue revolves around the fact that the Minister is not prepared to spend £44 million in increasing the rate of £13.20 to £17. It is reasonable that a rate which has remained constant since 1994 should be increased.</P>

      <QRef>[6115/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): This year's package of social welfare improvements is by far the most significant ever, involving a total package of over £428 million. In addition, the Social Welfare Bill which is currently before the House provides for substantial reductions in PRSI and health contributions for low paid workers, at a cost of £103 million. This amounts to a total package of £531 million. To put this in context, the equivalent figures for my previous two budgets were £225 million in 1998 and £316 million in 1999. Among the significant improvements provided for in this package are weekly increases of £7 for pensioners, a special increase of £5.90 for invalidity pensioners under 65 years and a £4 a week increase for all other social welfare recipients. In addition, special increases in the rate of qualified adult allowances are being provided for this year, as part of an overall strategy to increase the allowance to 70% of the main rate over three budgets.</P>
    <P>These increases in the weekly payments will take effect from the first week of May next &ndash; four weeks earlier than last year. This means that, since this Government has taken office, increases in weekly social welfare rates have been brought forward by six weeks from mid-June to the beginning of May. Next year, as we have already targeted, we intend to bring forward further the implementation date for social welfare increases to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April 2001.</P>
    <P>The cost of bringing forward this years improvements in weekly rates by four weeks to the beginning of May is £20 million, including the consequential changes to weekly FIS limits.</P>

      <P>The Minister is beginning to sound more and more like one of those Blairite ministers across the water. His mantra is all about the previous Government, yet he is approaching the third anniversary of his coming into office. I commend the Government on bringing forward the payment of increases to April but the complaint is still made, sometimes bitterly, that many increases are made late in the year. The Minister referred earlier to the reason the carer's benefit could not be introduced until October but given the necessity for child supports, why could child benefit not come on stream around the same time as the other major social welfare increases? Why are other relevant changes not made at that time? In that context, would it be possible to synchronise the social welfare and tax years on 5 or 6 April <Col N="960" /> or certainly in the first week of April? Is it possible to use the tax credit system in a positive way to introduce major new supports for people on low pay?</P>

      <P>My comments, and those of my party, on social welfare matters were restrained during the time the Deputy's party was in office, other than when the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, gave a 2.5% increase to old age pensioners when inflation at that time was only 2.5%.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question on tax credits, there is scope for that. Obviously it is an area we will examine in terms of the family income supplement and other initiatives. It is the desire of the Government, however, to align all the social welfare payments with tax changes so that they will kick in at the same time. Since we came into Government we brought forward payments by six weeks and next year we will, in effect, align the tax and social welfare changes.</P>

The reality is that they will have those increases for a year following September, so there is not a huge amount involved in that respect. I reiterate that we have made a commitment to bring forward all social welfare payments to when tax changes kick in, which is 5 or 6 April.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to set up a working group, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues of developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or <Col N="962" /> indexation of payments. As Deputies are aware, the programme is still to be ratified, and the social partners are engaged in this process. When the programme is ratified, it is intended to consult with the social partners on the composition of this working group, including the appointment of a chairperson.</P>
    <P>While formal terms of reference for the working group have not yet been set out, the issues to be covered by the group are set out in the programme. These include relative income poverty, as well as the long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI, distributive and incentive issues. These are highly complex issues which will need careful study. The outcome of the work of the group will have a significant impact on future policy in this regard, and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept many recipients of social welfare are disappointed that he did not act immediately on the benchmark of at least 50% this year? Does he accept also that many dependent claimants are bitterly disappointed that he did not move towards the 70% this year for dependent allowances, rather than over a three year period? There are several worthy objectives in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in terms of maintaining the real value of social welfare, individualisation, removing poverty traps and so on, but the Minister has not set out any policy on these matters. What is the Minister's preferred benchmark for an index of what people on social welfare should receive?</P>

I remind the Deputy that during this Government's term of office the old age pension has increased by 23% while during the term of the last Government, 1995 to 1997, it increased by 9.9%.

      <P>I have a great interest in child poverty. It is scandalous that there is so much child poverty in this country when there is so much money around. Is the Minister not concerned about that? Leave politics aside and look at the report of the UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights which highlighted this matter. Will the Minister agree, given the amount of money available, we have a duty to work towards eliminating child poverty from our society?</P>

Any public representative can see this in disadvantaged areas. Children who previously would not even get a sniff of a job because they had a particular address can now get jobs or have the potential to get jobs. Previously, as soon as they put down their address, they were told: &ldquo;Sorry, we do not take people from that estate&rdquo;. That is the reality.</P>

      <P>The Minister is correct that standards have increased immeasurably. However, the average industrial wage, one benchmark, is approaching £400 per week but the Minister is paying people on unemployment assistance or long-term disability benefit approximately £80 per week. That is very low when compared to the average industrial wage. The problem is that the benchmarks are getting more out of kilter with the reality of the economy. The Minister will agree that with a projected inflation rate of 7% for this year, people on unemployment payments will find it as hard to live as somebody on the average industrial wage. What does the Minister believe the benchmark should be?</P>

However, it is an incontrovertible fact that since this Government took office, 90,000 people have been taken off the live register. That is one third of the live register. Long-term unemployment has decreased dramatically. The number of people who were on the live register for more than three months has reduced dramatically. The best way out of poverty is to give people jobs. In the early 1990s there were one million people working, the number is now 1.7 million.

      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Quebec on 1 October 1994. These agreements have been put into operation. The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have acquired these rights while working in Ireland and the other countries to which the agreements apply. Similar protection of pension and other social security rights is afforded workers who have worked in Ireland and the other 14 EU member <Col N="965" /> states by the EU regulations on social security. These also apply to the member states of the European Economic Area &ndash; Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Their application is also likely to be extended to other European countries in the coming years in the context of the enlargement of the EU or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Consideration will continue to be given to concluding further bilateral agreements with individual countries where this is considered warranted by the number of persons who have been working in Ireland and the other country and where there is no immediate prospect of that country coming within the scope of comparable EU arrangements.

In the country in this case, which I would have considered a progressive country, it was much slower than the process here.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The National Anti-poverty Strategy, published in 1997, recognised that disadvantage and unemployment affect virtually every area in Ireland and that the poor and unemployed are not singularly clustered in major urban areas. However, particular communities suffer from cumulative disadvantage and for such people it is likely that the cumulative effect is to intensify their experience of disadvantage. In some cases, these communities are geographically concentrated, for instance, in decaying inner city areas. In recognition of this, disadvantaged urban areas was one of the five key theme areas targeted for specific attention by NAPS.</P>
    <P>The overall target of the NAPS in relation to urban disadvantage is to reduce the numbers of people suffering the greatest deprivation in disadvantaged urban areas by increasing their standard of living and providing opportunities for participation, thereby significantly reducing the measured indicators of disadvantage in the area, especially the rate of unemployment and long-term unemployment over the period to 2007.</P>
    <P>The Government asked the NAPS interdepartmental policy committee in June 1999 to draw up new targets and to reflect the changed environment. This review of the NAPS got under way late last year but substantial consideration of new areas was postponed pending the outcome of any new partnership agreement. The proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF &ndash; provides that, in consultation with the relevant actors, the national anti-poverty strategy will be updated, the underlying methodology reviewed, the existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate and possible new targets will be considered. The theme area of urban disadvantage will be one of the areas to be examined as part of this review process, especially in the area of housing and accommodation.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of the Environment and Local Government are working with local authorities to raise their awareness of the NAPS and to assist them in advising on the development of an anti-poverty strategy in the context of local government reform. The introduction of the NAPS initiative in local authorities is also provided for in the PPF. I see this expansion of the NAPS to the wider public service as one of the key challenges in its next phase and one which can play a significant role in addressing the spatial concentration of poverty in disadvantaged urban areas, including those in the south and east regions.</P>
    <P>The proposed new national agreement provides for a programme of targeted investments in disadvantaged areas. One of the objectives of this programme is to tackle, in particular, the spatial concentration of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, following objective selection criteria in the 25 most deprived urban and rural communities, including local authority housing estates with the greatest development needs. To advance this, an interdepartmental committee <Col N="967" /> will be established to identify and clarify the range of existing and proposed social inclusion measures in the NDP from which integrated intervention measures can be developed. This committee, following detailed consultations with the social partners, when formulating its proposals, will have regard to the experiences and implications of various existing schemes including the community development programme and the family services project.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in funding are planned for social inclusion measures under the NDP. This process seeks to ensure that these funds and actions are co-ordinated and targeted at the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that organisations such as the Dublin Employment Pact have clearly indicated, based on the research of the Trinity College economist, P.J. Drudy, that 11 of the 12 most disadvantaged areas in the country are in the Dublin region and that the other is on the north side of Cork city? Does he agree that the additional EU funds the Border, Midland and West region will receive over and above those received by the south and east regions will make it more difficult for these urban centres to access the moneys they need? Does the Minister also accept that a recent survey shows that one parish in my constituency of Dublin North-East still has 45% unemployment, which is ten times the national level of unemployment? Does he accept that the changes being made to the social economy will have a detrimental impact on the CEDP and voluntary and community programmes in those areas? Regarding decentralisation, a policy I do not accept given the unemployment in these areas, would the Government consider the decentralisation of major Government bodies to areas such as Coolock, Ballymun, Finglas, Blanchardstown, Tallaght, north Cork city or Limerick city? Would it consider such decentralisation which might be more relevant given the massive deprivation in those areas?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be the first Minister to present a National Minimum Wage Bill to the House. The Bill delivers on the Government's commitment to introducing a national minimum hourly wage. The Bill will ensure that tens of thousands <Col N="970" /> of low-paid workers will secure an increase in their pay to a level that reflects the status of this country as a modern developed economy and a caring society.</P>
    <P>The commitment to introduce a national minimum wage contained in the programme for Government was, in essence, a social policy commitment placed in the framework of an assault on exclusion, marginalisation and poverty. However, the Government also recognised that, as a social policy issue, it had significant economic implications. The terms of reference of the National Minimum Wage Commission reflected this. I indicated my concern to protect those workers who are vulnerable and prone to being exploited, especially women and young people. We also have to protect employment and competitiveness, and the Bill strikes the right balance. The outcome is both a victory for jobs and the rights of workers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an historic development which will influence the lives of many thousands of workers, both now and in future. Our economy has been radically transformed in recent years. Employment has reached new levels and unemployment has been significantly reduced. Real earnings of employees have improved substantially, although not all employees have equally benefited from our economic success. Many thousands of workers are paid rates which are no longer acceptable. A statutory minimum wage will greatly alter how we as a society view and value the work undertaken by thousands of workers which has historically been categorised as being of low skill, low esteem, dead-end and, consequently, low-paid. Such views have, to some extent, marginalised the workers concerned, reduced work incentives, and promoted a dependency culture, as well as subjecting them to low levels of income. Many of these workers are women and young people. However, the work performed by such workers has an intrinsic value to society that must be recognised and fairly rewarded.</P>
    <P>The National Minimum Wage Commission was the first step towards fulfilling the Government's commitment to introducing a national minimum hourly wage. The commission was appointed by the Government on 18 July 1997 to advise on the best way to implement the commitment. I thank the commission members, Evelyn Owens, Rita Ahern, Carmel Bolger, Phil Flynn and Peter Malone, for their valuable contribution to this important policy initiative. I published the commission's report on 5 April 1998.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that a target date of 1 April 2000 be set to implement the commitment. It also recommended that the national minimum wage should be measured against the median earnings of all employees.</P>
    <P>In taking this view the commission went on to state:</P>
    <P>The initial rate for the national minimum wage should be set at around two-thirds of median earnings and should take into account <Col N="971" /> employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>These two issues &ndash; the implementation date and the initial rate &ndash; have been central to the debate that followed the publication of the commission's report. The Government has, from the beginning, accepted that the national minimum wage should be introduced from 1 April 2000 and I have repeatedly stated this since April 1998 in order to ensure that both employers and workers had adequate time to prepare for the introduction of a national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>On the issue of what hourly rate should be set for a national minimum wage, the commission recommended that it should be set at around two-thirds of median earnings and should take into account employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness. Some people have tended to focus on the first element of this recommendation and ignore the latter one. The Government does not have that luxury. In deciding on the rate I considered that, in line with the thrust of the commission's recommendation, the impact of any proposed rate on employment and competitiveness must be taken into account. The ESRI impact study puts figures on the realities facing us in this regard in deciding on the appropriate rate, reduced employment, increased unemployment and reduced competitiveness. It would be easy in the current economic climate to disregard the impact of a high minimum wage but I must have regard to the welfare of the economy and, more importantly, the employment opportunities of its people now and in the future. The Government believes the introduction of a rigid automatic rate setting mechanism would not be the best way of addressing this issue. Since April 1988 I have stated that I consider that the appropriate rate should be £4.40 from April 2000. After considering the results of the ESRI impact study, I remained even more convinced that this was the appropriate rate.</P>
    <P>The recently negotiated Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also included a recommendation that the initial rate, will be £4.40 per hour from 1 April 2000, and that it should be increased to £4.70 from 1 July 2001 and to £5.00 from 1 October 2002. Mechanisms for adjusting this rate are contained in the Bill and agreement by the social partners to specific increases in the rate during the lifetime of the new agreement will be dealt with in that context. I also welcome the commitment of the trade unions and employers in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that no repercussive claims related to or following on from the application of the national minimum wage will be made by trade unions or employees.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about how the legislation interacts with the pay provisions in the recently negotiated Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. A worker on a wage which is less than £4.40 an hour will, from 1 April, in accordance with the legislation, have an entitlement to the new national hourly minimum wage. The new <Col N="972" /> agreement, once ratified, will apply to various workers at different stages throughout 2000 and may apply to some with effect from 1 April. The agreement does not provide a different regime of timing or flat or percentage increases for those whose pay would be altered by the legislation on 1 April. Consequently, it will be open to such workers to pursue the basic pay increases under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness separate from increases granted under the legislation.</P>
    <P>All the relevant terms of the draft pay agreement would apply in these, as in all cases, but that is a matter separate from the establishment of a national minimum wage. The Bill has been drafted in the context of the existing statutory minimum wage fixing machinery. Current statutory minimum rates of pay are specified in a number of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements, covering various occupations and industries ranging from agricultural workers to the construction industry. Employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements go beyond minimum wage fixing and include conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The National Minimum Wage Commission examined the question of whether the Joint Labour Committee/Employment Regulation Order system should continue to operate following the introduction of the national hourly minimum wage. The commission recommended that no changes be made to the Joint Labour Committee system and concluded that they should continue to set rates of pay and conditions of employment for the sectors covered by the committees. I have accepted this recommendation, subject to the proviso that where the minimum amount of pay prescribed in an Employment Regulation Order is less than that prescribed by the Bill, the employee's entitlement to remuneration will be in accordance with the Bill. This will also apply in relation to Registered Employment Agreements.</P>
    <P>The Bill strikes the right balance between the desire of society to prevent the exploitation of workers on low pay and the necessity to share the fruits of recent economic growth more fairly against the need to continue to grow employment and create wealth in our economy. I will now outline the purpose of the most significant sections of the Bill, which I hope all sides of the House can support.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides the Short Title and permits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by order to appoint a date on which the Bill or particular provisions of it will come into operation. I intend that the Bill shall be implemented with effect from 1 April 2000.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is central to the operation of the Bill. The pay of an employee may vary from time to time due to particular circumstances within the workplace, for example, working on different shifts or working on a Bank Holiday. The purpose of a pay reference period is to allow these variations that may arise to be averaged over the <Col N="973" /> pay reference period. The employer may choose the pay reference period which best suits his or her pay patterns, subject to it being no longer than one calendar month. The selection of a pay reference period for a national minimum wage under this Bill does not alter an employee's existing pay period. To ensure that an employee is informed by his or her employer as to the period which the employer has selected, section 42 will accordingly amend section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, to provide for this requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 11 enables the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by order to prescribe the national minimum hourly rate of pay having taken into account the impact the proposed rate may have on employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness in the economy. In relation to the review mechanism for the national minimum hourly wage, it is necessary in line with the recommendations of the interdepartmental group, to provide two mutually exclusive alternative mechanisms. Where a national agreement is in existence, or proposed, and contains a recommendation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to the national minimum hourly rate of pay, section 12 will apply. However, where these circumstances do not apply, section 13 provides that the Labour Court can be requested by an organisation substantially representative of employees or employers to make a recommendation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In either case the Minister may accept, vary or reject the recommendation. If varying or rejecting the recommendation, the Minister must make a statement to the Oireachtas of the reasons for that variation or rejection.</P>
    <P>Section 14 prescribes that an employee aged 18 or over must be paid for his or her working hours in any pay reference period at an hourly rate of pay that, on average, is not less than the national minimum hourly rate of pay unless sections 15, 16 or 39 apply. An employee under the age of 18 years must be paid for his or her working hours at an hourly rate of pay that, on average, is not less than 70% of the national minimum hourly rate of pay. Section 15 concerns the entitlement of a job entrant, being an employee who enters employment for the first time after reaching the age of 18 years, or having entered into employment before reaching the age of 18 years, who continues in employment on reaching that age. A job entrant must be paid by his or her employer for his or her working hours at an hourly rate of pay that, on average, is not less than 80% of the national minimum hourly rate of pay in the first year of having commenced employment for the first time, after reaching the age of 18, or the first year of employment, after continuing in employment on reaching the age of 18, and 90% of the national minimum hourly rate of pay in the second year of having commenced employment for the first time, after reaching the age of 18, or the second year of employment, after continuing <Col N="974" /> in employment on reaching the age of 18. Any employment under the age of 18 is not reckonable for this section.</P>
    <P>Section 16 implements the recommendation of the National Minimum Wage Commission that employees undergoing training should be paid 75%, 80% and 90% of the national minimum hourly rate of pay in the first, second and third year of training. An employee, aged 18 or over, undergoing a prescribed course of study or training authorised by his or her employer must be paid for his or her working hours at an hourly rate of pay that, on average, is not less than 75% of the national minimum hourly rate for the first year of training and 80% of the rate for the second year of training, and 90% for the third year of training. These percentage rates are to apply pro rata to each one-third of the duration of a course of study or training if it is less than three years.</P>
    <P>Regulations will prescribe the criteria to which a course of study or training must comply in order for an employer to apply the sub-minimum rates.</P>
    <P>The rationale underpinning these provisions, as stated by the commission and the interdepartmental group, is that, all other things being equal, an experienced employee is of more value and more productive than a new entrant or trainee. It is also equally important that those seeking employment would not be prevented from getting the opportunity to enter work because of their lack of experience or training.</P>
    <P>Section 19 and the Schedule to which it refers sets out what components of an employee's pay are reckonable and non-reckonable when calculating if an employee has been paid at least the minimum hourly rate of pay to which he or she is entitled in accordance with this Bill. The section reflects the recommendation of the interdepartmental group in the statement that all gross payments, which can be regarded as making up the rate for the job, should be considered to be reckonable, such as basic pay, bonus payments, commission, piece and incentive rates and allowances for special duties. The group also recommended that all premia payments paid to an employee in relation to normal or standard working hours should be included as reckonable pay.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the issue of what should constitute reckonable pay for national minimum wage purposes is difficult and has given rise to differing views, but the general principle advocated by the interdepartmental group, namely, that the general rate for the job should be the applicable criterion, provides a basis for addressing this issue. I would be concerned to ensure that those employees, who should mainly benefit from the introduction of a national minimum wage, are not deprived of this benefit by manipulation of reckonable and non-reckonable pay components. That is why, in addition to providing for changes in pay structures that may arise in the future, there is a degree of flexibility provided for in allowing the Minister to amend by regulation the <Col N="975" /> Schedule of components, as appropriate, after consultation.</P>
    <P>Section 23 has been designed to provide a structure that allows any potential dispute to be resolved speedily between an employee and an employer. An employee will have the right to request from his or her employer a written statement of his or her average hourly rate of pay during a particular pay reference period, subject to it being a pay reference period falling within 12 months immediately prior to the employee's request and not relating to the employee's current pay reference period. This process should help identify any under-payment and allow the parties to resolve the dispute without recourse to the enforcement provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 to 28 provide that a dispute which has not been resolved between the parties may be referred by either party to a rights commissioner for a decision and any party aggrieved with such a decision may appeal it to the Labour Court for determination. The rights commissioner or the Labour Court in dealing with an appeal, if satisfied that an employee has not been paid his or her entitlement under the Bill, will be empowered to award arrears of remuneration owing to the employee and to award reasonable expenses to the employee.</P>
    <P>Another mechanism to ensure employers will adhere to the provisions of the Bill will be the appointment of inspectors by the Minister under section 32. An employee who feels that he or she could not openly identify themselves by taking a case to a rights commissioner may, under section 33, request an inspector to investigate if his or her employer has failed to pay the employee's appropriate entitlement to remuneration under this Bill. It will be an offence under section 34 for an employer to refuse or to fail to pay an employee for each hour worked at an hourly rate of pay that on average is not less than the employee's entitlement to his or her minimum hourly rate of pay under this Bill. Section 36 provides for appropriate penalties to be imposed for offences committed contrary to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The ESRI impact study highlights the potential impact the national minimum wage could have on employment levels. With this in mind, the interdepartmental group recommended that provision be made for an inability to pay for firms in difficulty within certain parameters. Section 39 implements that recommendation without undermining the thrust of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 39 permits the Labour Court to grant a temporary exemption to an employer if satisfied that the employer is unable to pay the national minimum wage and if the employer were compelled to do so, the employee would likely be laid off or would have his or her employment terminated. An employer will only be entitled to be granted one temporary exemption by the Labour Court which shall not exceed one year. A number of other safeguards will apply, including the convening of a Labour Court hearing to examine the <Col N="976" /> application, and an employer must obtain the consent of each employee or the majority of employees affected to make the application to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>As evidenced by the ESRI impact study, repercussive or spill-over claims by those employees for whom the legislation is not intended to benefit could undermine the purpose of the legislation as well as negatively impacting on their own employment and on national competitiveness. It is, therefore, vital that the State's industrial relations machinery should not be used by such employees to further such claims. The National Minimum Wage Commission recommended that the social partners and the Government conclude an agreement that &ldquo;any claims on foot of the introduction of the minimum wage would not be recognised or accepted by the Labour Court&rdquo;. The interdepartmental group endorsed this approach but also recommended that a provision be included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 41 will implement that recommendation. The effect of the section is that the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, or a conciliation and arbitration scheme in the public sector, may not recommend in favour or endorse any claim or part of a claim referred to it which is based on the restoration of a pay differential between an employee and another employee who has secured or is to secure an increase in pay as a result of this Bill. Similarly, the Labour Court may not accept a proposal for an employment regulation order from a joint labour committee or register an employment agreement or vary a registered employment agreement if the proposal, agreement or variation is based on the restoration of a pay differential between an employee and another employee who has secured or is to secure an increase in pay as a result of this Bill. As I said earlier, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains an agreement by ICTU and employers that trade unions or employees will not make such claims.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill primarily provide safeguards for employees arising from its operation. As I mentioned earlier, the Schedule lists reckonable and non-reckonable pay components in calculating the minimum hourly rate of pay of an employee. I propose, subject to the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas, to bring the legislation into operation from 1 April 2000.</P>
    <P>I will, in accordance with section 11 by order, set the initial national minimum hourly rate of pay at £4.40 per hour from 1 April 2000. Having considered the findings of the ESRI study, I am satisfied that this hourly rate strikes the right balance between the need to ensure that vulnerable sectors of the workforce, mainly women and young people, are not exploited and the need to ensure that employment and competitiveness is maintained. As I said earlier, the recently concluded negotiations for a successor to Partnership 2000 included an agreement by the social partners that the national minimum wage hourly rate be <Col N="977" /> increased to £4.70 from 1 July 2001 and to £5 from 1 October 2002. The Government will consider this recommendation at the appropriate time in accordance with section 12 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>My Department will launch an intensive publicity and information campaign if the Bill is approved by the Oireachtas so that employers and employees will be aware of their obligations and entitlements. I recognise that enforcement of the national minimum wage is critical to the achievement of its objectives. The present complement of labour inspectors is ten and they are responsible for the enforcement nationwide of an extensive array of highly complex labour-employment legislation, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements. The need for additional resources for the inspectorate arising from the national minimum wage legislation has been acknowledged by both the National Minimum Wage Commission and the interdepartmental group on the implementation of a national minimum wage. Accordingly, the Government has agreed, at my request, to assign significantly increased staffing resources to the inspectorate to enable delivery of an enforcement service in respect of the national minimum wage legislation and other employment rights legislation. The additional resources consist of seven labour inspectors and three support staff.</P>
    <P>This Bill heralds a new era as to how society views and values the work undertaken by workers who have until now been confined to the margins of our economic progress. The Bill will ensure that 163,000 workers will receive an improvement in their pay as and from 1 April 2000. The Bill provides a fast and cost-free method to employees to determine disputes between them and an employer, an effective system of enforcement and a transparent method to review the hourly rate.</P>

      <P>What has happened in those two years?</P>

      <P>What has been happening since the National Minimum Wage Commission was established on 18 July 1997? The commission issued its preliminary report on 16 December 1997 and sought additional time before issuing its final report, a request with which everyone agreed. The final report was issued on 5 April 1998 and the Minister established an interdepartmental committee to consider how it might be implemented. That committee made its interim report in November and issued its final report in May 1999 which the Minister published, with great fanfare, on 22 June 1999, my birthday.</P>

      <P>In her statement that day, for which she received a great deal of publicity, the Minister said &ldquo;I will be announcing details of my legislative proposals in the near future.&rdquo;  Anybody seeking a definition of the term &ldquo;near&rdquo; would assume it meant one, two or, at the outside, three months, they would not assume it meant seven months. A finite date of 1 April 2000 was set for the introduction of the national minimum wage and for the legislation dealing with it to appear on 24 January 2000 was an insult to the House, to the people who will be obliged to implement the legislation and to the 160,000 whose wages are currently below the national minimum.</P>
      <P>We do not have time to trawl through the legislation to ensure that this historic development is properly placed on the Statute Book. Second Stage will be taken today and tomorrow and Committee Stage will be taken immediately thereafter. There will not even be one full day between Second and Committee Stages. The Opposition was obliged to reluctantly agree to take Committee Stage on Friday and again next week, mainly because Deputy Rabbitte and I are not in a position to devote six or seven hours on one sitting day to the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has an interest in this legislation will not be able to have the input to its passage to which they are entitled. As late as this morning I received a telephone from a representative of a chamber of commerce situated outside Dublin who informed me that the chamber did not know how the small businesses it represents would be able to implement the minimum wage by 1 April. It may be easy to do so if a firm's employees are all over 18 years of age, out of training and have been working with the company for some considerable time. In such cases, employees' whose wages are below the minimum will receive an increase on 1 April. What about a company with <Col N="979" /> an employee it considers to be involved in a training process but which does not have a structured training course in place? On employing the person, the owner of the company may have stated that for the first one or two years they would be considered to be learning the job or in training. That employer is entitled under the legislation to seek to pay an amount lower than the minimum wage to the employee in question. However, they will not have time to establish training structures and, if they do not want to find themselves in hot water with the courts, they will have no choice but to pay the minimum wage. They may be able to back-pedal when they establish the prescribed training courses.</P>
    <P>The speed with which the legislation is being introduced is unfair to the workers and to the 175,000 small businesses which form the backbone of employment. Companies with fewer than 50 employees offer most of the employment opportunities in this country. The small firms to which I refer, particularly those with three or four employees, will have difficulties implementing the legislation if they do not have structured training courses in place while one or two of their employees are considered to be in training.</P>
    <P>For many months, Deputy Rabbitte and I morning after morning inquired after the whereabouts of the legislation. I went as far as to inform the Minister that if it was not introduced early enough we would be obliged to squash the debate on it into a few short days. That is precisely what has happened. Measure the delay in bringing this legislation forward with what occurred in the UK, the only other European country apart from Ireland which did not have a national or statutory minimum wage. The UK authorities published their legislation on 26 November 1997. It gained what they call &ldquo;royal assent&rdquo; on 31 July 1998, which meant that parliamentarians had seven months to discuss the legislation with various interested parties in their constituencies. The legislation did not come into effect until 1 April 1999, meaning that almost year elapsed from the time the National Minimum Wage Act, 1998, gained royal assent until the minimum wage was introduced. In the interim, consultations took place, regulations were introduced and committees of the House of Commons had the opportunity to consider the legislation and decide whether they were satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>In my view, the Minister has been found wanting in terms of the way she has dealt with this Bill which is one of the crucial elements of her legislative programme as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am disappointed &ndash; I am sure the Minister is also disappointed but is not in a position to admit it &ndash; at the way matters have been handled. A number of months ago the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, came before the House with the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill. All Stages of that legislation were taken in quick succession in both <Col N="980" /> Houses. On that occasion we informed the Minister of State that we would facilitate him because the flotation of Eircom had to proceed but we also said that we would not do so again because people needed to have an opportunity to examine such complicated legislation.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, at my suggestion, recently put in place an extremely successful mechanism for dealing with the Copyright Bill. Between Second and Committee Stages, we invited the different groups interested in the legislation to appear before the committee to discuss the legislation. Not only did Members hear their views but they heard each other's views. In my view that was a very good exercise in democracy and it allowed lobbying groups to see the problems encountered by their counterparts. That mechanism has served the committee well while it continues to debate the legislation in question.</P>
    <P>There is no time to take similar action in respect of the National Minimum Wage Bill. I would have liked a week to have been set aside in order that the INOU, ICTU, the chambers of commerce, the Small Firms' Association, IBEC, etc., might discuss their concerns about the implementation of the legislation with Members. That would have proved beneficial because suggestions for amendment to the legislation might have been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As a profession, politics is losing face because everything is moving outside this House for discussion. The emphasis on scrutinising legislation has been removed from the House because no one takes a blind bit of notice of its proceedings anymore.</P>
    <P>While there is one journalist in the Press Gallery today, little or no recognition is generally given to our debates on legislation, unless it is extraordinarily interesting or very controversial. I am sorry to go on about that but I am really disappointed with the Minister, particularly given what happened in the UK.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say she could not do anything until the new partnership programme, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, was negotiated. However, that would be wrong because the bulk of this legislation is enabling. She has not put a figure in it, although I know she wanted to. This legislation could have been drafted and published before the social partners began their discussions. That would have been very helpful and might have helped the Minister make some amendments to the legislation. I hope she will take on aboard the amendments I table because there are flaws in this legislation. I agree with the overall principle of a minimum wage. However, the Minister is running the risk of not having the best possible legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a well known African expression that Fr. Sean Healy has often used in discussions with me &ndash; when elephants fight it is only the grass that gets trampled. This legislation is not for the elephants of this society but for the people on the grass. They need a national minimum wage. We <Col N="981" /> see the trappings and manifestations of great wealth &ndash; boats, two and three cars and good houses &ndash; of many people, many of whom worked very hard to get it. That is wonderful and it is great to see Irish people succeeding and enjoying prosperity. However, we must also remind ourselves that many people are living on very small wages and incomes. Pensioners and widows are living on £72 or £73 per week. As a colleague said to me, two people would not get very much for £70 in any medium or good restaurant. Some people have to live for a week on that much money. This legislation is for the people in our society who have not felt the breath of the Celtic tiger or heard him purring in their ear.</P>
    <P>When the idea of a minimum wage was first proposed some people said it would be very damaging and would cause a loss of jobs and growth. Perhaps in 1997, when it was first announced, there might have been some factuality to that and there might still be some job losses. However, we should look carefully at what the chairman of the British low pay commission, Professor George Bain, said when he was asked about this.</P>
    <P>He said he would be surprised if there were not some job losses but that perhaps British workers might be better off without the sort of low wage jobs that could be lost. He said the scale of losses would be based on the level of the minimum wage. He also went on to say that the jobs which it might be better to lose, for which I am sure he was criticised, would be those very low skilled, low paid positions which Britain should be looking to move beyond. He said he did not think the future for Britain was to try to compete with the low wage economies of the Third World. He went on to say that anyone who says they know what the impact will be is misleading people because there are so many imponderables, which was also said in the preliminary report of the minimum wage commission.</P>
    <P>Things have changed even in the two years since the Small Firms Association and IBEC made some quite trenchant and strong statements about the introduction of a minimum wage. It is now almost impossible for employers to get employees and they often have to offer them wages above the minimum wage we are introducing, which is good. I was told by the part owner of a major hotel in Dublin that high class hotels must pay a minimum of £5 per hour and £9 per hour for evening work to get good staff. They have had to move with the times.</P>
    <P>The experience in the UK was that as soon as a minimum wage began to be discussed, many of the firms which felt it would affect them began to move towards making changes in their pay structures, so that the gap between their current pay levels and the minimum wage they would eventually have to pay would not be too great and they could plan it in a phased way. I believe that has also been happening in this country, either in a proactive way or as something forced on employers who cannot get employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> Those who are saying this is bad for the country do not have a strong case to make. However, they are entitled to ask how it will be implemented and to make a claim under section 39 that they cannot pay the minimum wage because a financial downturn means the company will close if they have to pay it and the employees will lose their jobs. I welcome that protection.</P>
    <P>However, there is a feeling in Britain that the minimum wage can lead, and has led, to more jobs. Professor Bain said that Prime Minister Blair and Mr. Brown have said that American evidence shows that a minimum wage leads to a raising of productivity and forces employers to train their staff better. That is a double gain of better trained staff and more productivity, and the employer gets better value for his £4.40 an hour, although I hope very few people will be earning such a low wage. It is important to recognise that the direction our society and economy have taken has helped considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister said rightly that the people who will benefit most from this national minimum wage will be women and those under 25 years. That is as it should be because far too many women are working in sectors where they are paid very little. Most of the women earning those low wages have no choice. Due to responsibilities in their homes and the lack of child care places, they have to take a job that pays only £2.50 per hour because that extra £40 or £50 will mean they are not hungry at the end of the week or can buy shoes for their child to wear to school. They are forced into exploitative employers' hands.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the issue of home helps. This minimum wage will also apply to the public service. Did any Departments object to the introduction of a minimum wage? Did they complain they would not be able to pay it unless they got more money? The level of home help pay is a scandal. It ranges from about £2 to £3.50 per hour for really difficult and stressful work. As a result of the chaos in our hospitals, many people are being sent home early from hospital to free up beds. The pressure of minding somebody who should, perhaps, have stayed in hospital for another week falls on the local support staff of the health boards, principally the home helps. They have to help old or sick people get in and out of bed and use the toilet, dress them and dress wounds if bandages fall off. A home help is called on to do this stressful work as well as providing food, comfort, conversation and company for a sick or old person.</P>
    <P>It must sicken those home helps to hear people talk about the high wage economy when they are taking home £20 or £40 after a number of hours of really difficult work. I hope the Minister can assure me that the Department of Health and Children will provide the necessary money immediately from 1 April to every health board and that if, on 2 April, I telephone a home help, almost all of whom are women, she will be able to tell me she is getting £4.40 an hour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The minimum wage on its own will not help the unemployed or the low paid and the Government must provide a package of measures to improve the position of such people. There is a need for tax reform, but not tax reform for the rich as in the Government's budgets so far, including the fiasco of the last budget where it did not know how to cope. A total of £60 of the minimum wage will be taxed. The Government raised the tax free threshold to £120 but the remaining £60 earned by a person working a 39-hour week on £4.40 per hour will be taxed. The Government promised to deal with this issue but has not introduced any measures to date. Fine Gael's proposal to exempt the first £170 of earnings, the minimum wage level, should have been taken up by the Government in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government must also provide targeted training for the unemployed and those on low incomes in low-skilled jobs. These are the people who will suffer if there is a downturn in employment statistics. The Government must also provide a proper employment service. I appeal to the Minister to look again at the community employment schemes. From 1 April, in conjunction with the introduction of the minimum wage, the Minister proposes to introduce changes to CE schemes which will mean people over 35 years of age who spend three years on a CE scheme will not be able to join another scheme. The Minister uses words like &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; but FÁS officials on the ground do not know what she means by this. As far as they are concerned if someone completes three years on a CE scheme and they are over 35 years of age they cannot take part in another scheme &ndash; three years is the cut-off point. The Minister should give real flexibility in this area as these people will probably never enter full-time employment because of their age and the work they are doing suits the CE schemes. The Minister has a responsibility to re-examine this proposal.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to a UK study which indicated that the minimum wage did not result in a downturn in employment as there were so many imponderables involved. The preliminary report published by the commission stated that it can be difficult to interpret the competing results concerning the employment effects of minimum wages. It also noted that many studies reported small negative effects, others reported zero effects and some had found small positive effects. This defeats the argument that there will be a downturn in employment.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the tourism sector which, I hope, will be assisted by the minimum wage. It is estimated that 51% of those employed in hotels, catering and tourism are skilled workers. All jobs in tourism and catering involve some form of skill. They are not low-skilled jobs whether one is clearing tables, waiting on tables or making beds. A survey carried out in 1997 estimated that 57% of employees in this sector work longer <Col N="984" /> hours than the national average of 40.4 hours per week, 37% work 41 to 50 hours per week and 20% work between 51 and 80 hours per week. The survey also indicated that almost half the graduates surveyed earned under £150 per week while three quarters earned under £200 per week. These are skilled catering and tourism workers and these salaries are disgraceful. Ireland is second from bottom among OECD countries in that 24% of our workers are paid less than 66% of the median average earnings. This is a disgraceful indictment.</P>
    <P>I wish to address some of the concerns expressed by the SFA and IBEC. I am glad the PPF addressed the issue of follow-on claims and the Minister also dealt with it in this Bill. I hope this will allay that concern. Section 16 of the Bill deals with training but is extremely badly written in the sense that I do not know, nor can any employer know, what is meant by a prescribed course of study or training authorised by the employer. It is a different matter if someone is sent on a FÁS training course but what if an employer establishes a training course? No work has been done on this issue and the legislation needs to set out what constitutes training provided by employers, otherwise there will be exploitation. A training course allows the employer to pay 75% of the minimum wage for the first 12 months, 80% in the second 12 months, 90% in the third 12 months following which the trainee goes on to the full minimum wage. There will be exploitation if there is no structured training regime in a company.</P>
    <P>What will happen if a worker who has taken part in a three year training course and eventually obtains the minimum wage, moves to another company? Can the new employers decide they do not like the previous training received by the employee and send him or her on another course so that the worker ends up on a merry-go-round of training courses for three, six or nine years? The legislation does not deal with this scenario so I have tabled an amendment which would prevent a new employer from behaving in this way.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will produce more information on Committee Stage on how training will be defined, how assessment will be carried out, what certification will exist and how one will compare in-house and outside training? How will colleges or courses be prescribed? If a person is in the beauty business and sets up a training course in his or her house, will that be enough to constitute a training course? What about small companies with only three or four employees who want to take part in training? What will happen when such a company has to let go an employee?</P>
    <P>In a report produced in the UK six months after the introduction of the minimum wage, John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, noted that everyone agreed that the minimum wage had no effect on jobs or inflation and expressed disappointment at the lack of an annual review. The report also noted that there is little evidence of <Col N="985" /> jobs being lost as a result of the minimum wage and that there were no signs of significant minimum wage effects on employment figures and no measurable impact on overall employment. This report deals with the concerns expressed by the Minister and others.</P>
    <P>As regards enforcement, I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be more inspectors but I am not sure this will be enough. Some of the claims for Partnership 2000 will not be settled until October 2000 or later. What will happen if, on 1 April, an employer claims that with the full implementation of Partnership 2000 in October his or her employees will reach the £4.40 level and so they are not obliged to pay the minimum wage on 1 April because it was back-loaded from Partnership 2000? I seek an assurance that workers will get their money from 1 April.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not include safeguards on anti-avoidance measures which have been included in other recent legislation and I will table amendments to deal with this issue. When setting out what constitutes reckonable and non-reckonable income, I hope the Minister will remove from reckonable pay some of the social and bank holiday payments. She should also exclude tips paid to low income workers in their payrolls. This is a mean provision. The Minister is not regarding tips paid directly into workers' pockets as reckonable but is making those paid in wages as reckonable. People earn tips because of the quality of service they provide and they are entitled to them. We should do away with tips and give a better wage, but once tips are earned they should not be regarded as reckonable income.</P>

      <P>I have rarely looked forward to a Bill as much as this one. It has the capacity to remedy a major and widespread injustice in society. Rarely, however, have I been so disappointed by a Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 19 and its accompanying Schedule go to the heart of the national minimum wage. To the ordinary worker the Bill means that the basic wage will be fixed at £4.40. Section 19, however, does not do that. It states that &ldquo;reckonable components&rdquo; may be taken into account when calculating the hourly rate. Those reckonable components, defined in Part 1 of the Schedule, include basic salary; service pay; shift premium; unsociable hours premium; all productivity related payments such as piece and incentive rates, commission and bonuses; allowances for special or additional duties, including those of a post of responsibility; the monetary value of board with lodgings; any amount distributed to the employee of tips or gratuities paid in a central fund managed by the employer; the amount of any service charge distributed to the employee through the payroll; public holiday premium, Saturday premium, Sunday premium and where any such holidays or days are worked; any payments under section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, and other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> I take no pleasure in this but one has to conclude that it is fraudulent for the Tánaiste or anyone else to promulgate a national minimum rate of £4.40. It is a fraud and an abuse of language. Take one element of all those listed &ndash; premium pay. The situation is well established, a two cycle shift earns a premium of 16.6%, a three cycle shift earns 20% and continuous shift working earns 33%. That may be taken into account when calculating the basic hourly rate. On top of that there could be service pay, holiday pay or weekend working. Any such pay component can be put into the melting pot and divided by the number of hours in the working week. An employer could pay £3 per hour and implement the terms of this Bill properly because shift premium, service pay and weekend working could be added on and he would be within the £4.40 rate.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the drafting of this legislation. The English in the British legislation is a great deal more simple and succinct. I do not know why such simplicity should be so difficult here, in a city that boasts of the best spoken English in the world and where it is written as well as anywhere else. When all the verbiage is stripped away, the unfortunate young person on the lowest of wages has been led to believe by the Tánaiste and the Government that he will have a minimum rate of £4.40 per hour. It will not be like that at all.</P>
    <P>I say that because, as Deputy Owen said, low pay is a major problem in this economy. Job expansion in this State has been unprecedented, almost exponential, in the past six years. There is, however, a serious problem of low pay. It is amazing how quickly those of us who are on a somewhat more comfortable wage &ndash; I include my respected friends in the Civil Service in this &ndash; forget the conditions in which some low paid workers labour. The Tánaiste established an interdepartmental committee to implement the work of the commission. I can imagine those committed and intelligent senior civil servants sitting around a table and working out that the figure of £4.40 per hour has to be eroded because it might break the economy. I am not commenting on the commitment of those civil servants to their jobs or their excellence at them, but it is remarkable that someone on a relatively comfortable wage can sit around and decide that £4.40 an hour could unhinge the economy.</P>
    <P>For that reason they inserted section 19. Now they do not have to worry about it because, under section 19, the figure can be circumscribed in such a fashion that it is no longer £4.40 per hour. By including these premium payments it becomes a case of now you see it, now you do not.</P>
    <P>It is quite improper to include unsociable hours premiums. In Britain basic wage means basic wage. The addition of premium payments for the purposes of calculation is not permitted. Service pay might not be much but for someone earning £4.50 per hour, 40p is significant. Add in shift premium, which ranges from 16.6% to 33%, weekend working and holiday pay and it becomes very <Col N="987" /> significant. Effectively, it undermines what the Tánaiste seeks to do.</P>
    <P>Low pay is a widespread phenomenon. When in Government, people get so accustomed to making speeches and beating their breast, telling us how well they are doing and about all the jobs they are creating and the efforts they are making to bring in 200,000 from outside the State that they forget there are many people in the State who find it difficult to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste may reply by saying that the trade union movement agreed to this. If it did we must remember that the people on this rate of pay are generally not trade union organised. That is why the trade union movement has never overly concerned itself about this issue. These workers are outside the trade union movement. They form the most vulnerable section of workers.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste may ask, as she has done on a number of occasions, why the Rainbow Government did not introduce a minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The question never featured from the social partners during the period of the Rainbow Government, nor did it feature during the negotiations for Partnership 2000. It was not an issue. My colleague, Deputy De Rossa, raised the matter, but he received little or no support from the social partners generally. On 28 October 1995 what was then <i>The Cork Examiner</i> contained a headline &ldquo;A minimum wage is not the answer, says Ahern&rdquo; and in the following article the then Deputy Bertie Ahern, leader of Fianna Fáil, went on to deliver what was described as a &ldquo;strong attack&rdquo; on the call by the then Minister for Social Welfare for a minimum wage. That was the official position, but history has been rewritten and I acknowledge the Taoiseach's skill in dealing with the issue. When we considered the pending general election in 1997 it was suggested that it might be a good idea to promise a minimum wage in our election manifesto, but we then remembered what happened in 1977.</P>
    <P>My union, the then ITGWU, now SIPTU, did not espouse a statutory national minimum wage for various historical reasons and also because the union was of the view that it would act as a disincentive to recruitment and to low paid people joining the union. This was at a time when there was a high penetration of trade union organisation in the country. The issue has only come into focus in recent years. I know it is different on the Continent &ndash; many things are different there.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste knows that when the commission published its report in April 1998, it recommended a rate of £4.40 per hour. If account is taken of the movement in earnings in the two years between then and now, the April 2000 equivalent of this figure would be £4.90 per hour. In the negotiations just finished SIPTU sought a rate of £5 per hour and the Government indicated it would consider a higher rate if the employers and trade unions agreed on one. Nothing was agreed and the Tánaiste and the Government submitted to the employers' resistance. This <Col N="988" /> meant the commitment to the principle of relating the minimum wage to two-thirds of median earnings has now been departed from. If this principle, which was generally accepted on this side of the House, was applied to the April 2000 context, the rate of £4.40 per hour will represent 52%, not two thirds, of median earnings.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Owen's comments on the Tánaiste's skill in the area of promotion and the way she has sold this measure. She has launched it a number of times since November 1997. However, it is little understood outside the House that we are not getting a minimum wage of £4.40 per hour for the reasons I have explained, nor are we getting a minimum wage that represents two-thirds of median earnings.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the trade union leaders in concluding the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness because it is a considerable achievement in the wake of 12 years of social partnership to be able to continue it in present conditions of relative affluence. It brings many advantages in terms of certainty, planning and so on. As with any deal a contract is made, issues are prioritised and compromises are made. I would love to see the day when my Oireachtas colleague, Senator O'Toole, would have as his main focus the question of the national minimum wage because I doubt if it would be struck at £4.40 per hour, eroded by the method of calculation set out in the Bill. The Bill has no significance for most trade union members. It will be relevant to those who are not in unionised employments.</P>
    <P>I am unable to suggest with any accuracy that when this legislation is enacted it will have a major impact on society. The Tánaiste knows as well as I do that the proposed hourly rate has been overtaken in the market place.</P>

      <P>Whatever this modest, flawed measure does, it does not herald a new era for workers. We in this House should maintain some perspective on reality and not indulge in that kind of hyperbole, which bears little relationship to the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> There were objections to a proposed national minimum wage in 1997, but does the Tánaiste believe this issue is now among IBEC's top ten concerns? IBEC knows the reality. It knows that if McDonald's Restaurants advertises for children to work at £5 per hour the proposal to set the minimum wage at that rate in 2002, as provided for in the Bill, has no meaning. It has no meaning in most of urban Ireland, although it may impact on some pockets in provincial areas. Even here, the value of the measure to young exploited workers is negligible because of the manner of calculation.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for any anti-avoidance mechanisms. Anybody with knowledge of this business knows that certain kinds of employers will manipulate the terms of the legislation. The Minister has said she does not want to see this happen, yet she has not included any provisions to prevent this.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Deputy O'Flynn telling me how good employers are. I know there are many good employers, but we are trying to catch those who are not so good because they are exploiting young workers, etc. Anti-avoidance or anti-evasion mechanisms are necessary to prevent such employers from doing what we have seen them do elsewhere, namely, reduce the number of hours. It is easy to pay £4.40 per hour if the number of hours is reduced. Overtime working can be described as &ldquo;unsociable hours&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The names of some payments can be changed to fit into the category of reckonable components under section 19. I am not suggesting this is a widespread phenomenon among Irish employers, but it does happen and this area has not been addressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Owen said, it is regrettable that we are discussing the Bill effectively under guillotine. The Committee on Enterprise and Small Business acceded to the request from the Minister and said it would attempt to facilitate the enactment of the legislation by 1 April, as is required by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We did so with the utmost reluctance as we know it is virtually impossible to give it the attention it requires and for Opposition Deputies, who have minimal back-up, to be able to engage in the research required. Second Stage will end with many Deputies offering to contribute. However, we have been told by the whips to facilitate the conclusion of Second Stage tomorrow night at the request of the Minister. The following morning Committee Stage will begin, which has only happened in emergency circumstances. We have to draft amendments before we make speeches on Second Stage, an amusing situation if the matter was not so serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not something which crept up on the Minister. Rather it is something the Minister has been brooding over since taking up office. Therefore, she had plenty of notice and time for prep<Col N="990" /> aration. The Minister is looking over her glasses at me and may well latch onto Deputy Owen's line that she was waiting for the Programme on Prosperity and Fairness to be concluded. However, Deputy Owen and I know that the Minister was not waiting for the programme and made a fair effort at a solo run just before Christmas when she tried to upstage it. She wanted to include a rate of £4.40 in the Bill and to publish it.</P>

      <P>Let me give credit where it is due. I acknowledge that the Minister got her way, and this is a pity in terms of the tens of thousands of workers who were expecting some relief under the Bill. The great conciliator, however he did it, brought the unions back on line. I am not going to make any cheap shots at the expense of the Minister because I think this reflects her personal political orientation, which is fair enough and I respect it. However, she is letting her ideological slip show in this regard. There is no basic commitment to the concept of a national minimum wage. It is one of the things to which the Government realised it was committed following the election. Neither is there a commitment to it in the Minister's Department. The Department was horrified when the programme for Government was examined in the aftermath of the 1997 election. I know the mantra &ndash;&ldquo;It will halt our economic progress. It will put jobs at risk. Jobs will be lost&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what the rate is fixed at and how it is calculated. The rate of £5 per hour suggested by SIPTU seems reasonable in current conditions. If McDonalds is paying young people £5 per hour, it is unreasonable to expect anybody to work in the rag trade in factory conditions for less than £5 per hour. The inclusion of the reckonable factors in the Bill has undermined this.</P>
      <P>It is strange that on the one hand we are so bellicose and so given to boasting about the Celtic tiger economy and on the other hand we have such a lack of confidence that we have to build mechanisms into the Bill to allow the Minister dismantle it in a doomsday situation. On reading sections 11 and 12 one would think there was an outbreak of war. Under those sections the Minister may, in certain circumstances, intervene and call the whole thing off. She may even alter, vary, change, amend or reject a Labour Court recommendation. Since 1946 we have lectured both sides of industry that they must not reject Labour Court recommendations. Now the Minister is saying that in case war is declared she wants to be in a position to reject a Labour Court recommendation. It is fantastical and does not show much confidence.</P>

It would not have returned to me with a similar report.</P>
      <P>Having said that, we on this side of the House have tried to facilitate the passage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to understand that we also have certain responsibilities and duties to perform and while we are foreshortening the debate we want the opportunity on Committee Stage to deal with some of these important matters. She <Col N="992" /> hinted in her contribution that she might be amenable to considering some changes, but she had better ask her officials to read the contributions to this debate and prepare for agreed changes, otherwise Committee Stage will take a long time. I do not say that in a threatening sense but these issues must be addressed. For example, the Minister hinted that she might be amenable to rethinking her approach to section 19, which is a key section. It was important that she gave such an indication because otherwise Committee Stage would take as long as that of the Copyright Bill, 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the trade unions have never shown a huge commitment to dealing effectively with the needs of people who are essentially outside the organised labour area. However, the Deputy may be bringing some of the baggage of his trade union background to this debate because despite all his talk he does not display great commitment to the introduction of the national minimum wage. The constituency he represents very much mirrors mine. There has been high unemployment but in recent times, due to economic progress and the actions of the Government, there has been a significant reduction in the levels of long-term unemployment. The most recent figures for part of my constituency indicated that 400 people were on the long-term unemployed register.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is falling but many of those who return to work take up quite low paid employment. It is important that that sector is protected. Many women and young people in my constituency work in the catering industry, which is notorious for its low wage regime; the rag trade, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred; the security industry, which is notorious for its exploitation of workers; and the cleaning and retail industries. All those workers will surely benefit from the introduction of a national minimum wage. Home helps are paid £3 per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, it is incumbent on all of us to make provision for better working conditions for such people. I hope the House will support the Bill and I praise the Minister for its introduction. It should be recalled that other measures, such as the PRSI exemption, were introduced in the budget and these will improve the lot of the low paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was concerned about comments made by <Col N="993" /> Simon Nugent, a director of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. He referred to the need to delay the introduction of the national minimum wage. That should not be entertained and none of us should countenance it. There are concerns in the home improvements-DIY sector, which is open to competition from multinationals, but it operates in the commercial world and the companies involved are well aware of how to approach measures such as this.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council welcomed the introduction of the Bill from day one. It is a significant protection and will be of significant benefit to thousands of young people on low pay. The Minister referred to an information campaign. A proactive campaign is vital because the minimum wage will be introduced on 1 April. For example, when the minimum wage was introduced in the UK there was a lengthy information campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined the dates. We did not get that time here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is even more important that a well targeted campaign is undertaken so that the potential beneficiaries of the national minimum wage and employers are aware of its existence.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned that only ten departmental inspectors are responsible for enforcement of the legislation. I am glad that seven additional inspectors and three support workers have been recruited. It is important because many of us will recall how difficult it was to police the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. Employers have little reason for not being aware of or being ready to implement the minimum wage provisions. Clearly, some employers are opposed to its introduction and they have articulated their views. I was lobbied months ago by some of them and they know where I stand. It is also important in terms of enforcement that the inspectors try to work outside of office hours because a small number of unscrupulous employers will find ways of getting around their obligations, if necessary. It took three years to fully enforce the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. There are still loopholes in it but it is a good deal better than what went before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion has been made to me and I ask the Minister to consider it. It could be included in the regulations which are to be introduced as a result of this legislation. A provision could be included obliging employers to display information on minimum pay in the workplace. That would be similar to the provisions in the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, whereby employers are compelled to display posters with information on their obligations and young people's rights. Young people attending third level institutions or participating in further education should be the focus of an information campaign and commercial radio stations in Dublin, to which many young people listen, might be a vehicle for explaining young people's entitle<Col N="994" /> ments. A help line ought to be introduced which will be staffed by people, preferably officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who are knowledgable about the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that I fully understand the Bill but there will be ballet dancing over section 19, which deals with reckonable and non-reckonable income. It is important that an information campaign to explain the intricacies of the legislation is undertaken. On young people involved in training, the fact that reduced rates will only apply where the training leads to certification is to be welcomed as it will ensure that employers will not be able to exploit the provision. Employers should be made aware that there is no room for ambiguity in the interpretation of this provision. Unfortunately, experience has shown that employers will abuse such loopholes if they feel they can get away with it.</P>
    <P>An ongoing programme of information should be targeted at young people, thousands of whom will be entering the workforce every year. In regard to the categories of workers outside the trade union loop, some mechanism must be devised to inform them of the Bill's provisions. I suggest the establishment on an ongoing basis of a national minimum wage commission comprising trade union, employer, Government and social partner representatives.</P>
    <P>The commission originally recommended that the initial national minimum wage rate should be set at approximately two-thirds of median earnings and should take account of employment levels, overall economic conditions and competitiveness. While £4.40 would have represented two-thirds of median earnings when the recommendation was made, that is no longer the case. I acknowledge that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a step by step improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions and believe that, by and large, employers will support their implementation. Although a small number of employers may be tempted to manipulate the Bill's provisions to avoid their implementation in the workplace, I hope they will not do so. The provisions will benefit a significant number of workers in the area which I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to declare my interest in this Bill as an employer. As a public representative, I am aware that the Bill will assist many low paid workers as its introduction has been welcomed by many of the people visiting my clinics. As an employer, I support the introduction of a measure of social solidarity and the recognition that a wage floor must be imposed. Most employers pay fair wages but the few who pay scandalously low wages drag down the good name of others. This Bill will go some way towards addressing negative perceptions of Irish business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Home helps are among the groups who will <Col N="995" /> benefit from the Bill's provisions. There are currently 8,293 home helps employed in Ireland, 2,500 of whom are employed in the Southern Health Board area, at a rate of £3 per hour. I welcome the fact that those people will now be paid £4.40 per hour.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a major information campaign which would make employers and employees aware of the Bill's provisions. While most people are aware that the general rate will be £4.40 per hour, I suspect that few would be aware of what the rates of pay will be for those under 18 years of age, for trainees or for new job entrants. I also doubt that many people are aware of what the £4.40 covers, whether bed and board is classified as reckonable or non-reckonable income or what constitutes training for the purpose of the training rate. These are the types of questions being asked by employers and employees and we must ensure that those affected are informed of the answers before 1 April.</P>
    <P>In January, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland conducted a survey of 342 businesses in 25 locations throughout Ireland. The survey revealed that only two firms could correctly answer questions on the proposed date of introduction, the rate, whether the minimum wage applied to under-18s or other groups or whether allowances would be made for variations between industry sectors. Many employers are not aware of the key aspects of this Bill. I urge the Minister to inform as a matter of priority all those who will be affected by the Bill. I suggest that a dedicated helpline and website be put in place to deal with queries in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides that it is ultimately the Minister who will set the rate which is expected to be based on agreement among the social partners although the Minister may reject or alter their recommendations. There is no provision in the Bill which requires that an adequate period of notice be provided to the public regarding any changes in the rate. As it stands, the Minister could simply announce that the rate would be increased or decreased with immediate effect. That could create difficulties as it would not allow employers adequate time to adjust and prepare in terms of working out the costs involved in any increases. A sufficient lead-in period must be provided for any change in the rate and any intended changes should be publicised in advance to allow businesses to make necessary adjustments to their financial plans.</P>
    <P>I want to issue a word of warning to any business people or employers who may be considering running for election to this House. They should forget it because details of their private lives and assets will be splashed across the pages of the Sunday newspapers. I, among other Members of this House, received a fax last week from <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> which contained five personal questions about my business and family affairs with the implication that I should answer <Col N="996" /> them or the newspaper would report my refusal to do so. I consigned that fax to the bin.</P>
    <P>I do not object to facts being printed about me as a public representative but private interests should remain private. Some sections of the media are abusing their position, setting out to pillory politicians in the name of investigative journalism. Last Sunday, <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> beat all by attempting to summarise the value of Members' property assets on the basis of the register of Members' interests which is laid in the Oireachtas Library. In my view, that goes beyond the boundaries of acceptability.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, was never intended to be abused in this manner by some sections of the media. As I understand it, the Bill's intention was to create transparency and reveal possible conflicts of interest in regard to our role as public representatives. I am in favour of the register of Members' interests but I am opposed to people's private assets being calculated by journalists, aided and abetted by auctioneers and other professionals who can use a calculator, and splashed across the pages of the national press.</P>
    <P>I am concerned for the safety of my family. My family has now become a target for criminal gangs and potential criminal acts. It is not so long ago that members of the families of business people were kidnapped and held to ransom for large sums of money. I spend three days in Dublin every week. I do not know whether someone is casing my house at the moment with the intention of burgling it or committing other criminal acts. I was horrified to see photographs of Members' houses published in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> last Sunday.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about my personal business interests. My creditworthiness or customer confidence could be affected by the <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> article. <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> employed professional auctioneers to carry out these valuations. We are paying a very high price for being involved in politics and I am not sure it is worth it.</P>

      <P>I am privileged to follow a millionaire Deputy and I welcome his commitment to the national wage agreement. This is an important Bill and it is regrettable that it is being rushed through the House. We must get it right. This is an opportunity to legally protect young and vulnerable people in employment. We are burying our heads in the sand if we think young people and housewives who must work to supplement meagre incomes and support their families are not being exploited.</P>
      <P>Deputies Owen and Rabbitte have a good insight into this Bill. This legislation is a three card trick &ndash;&ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;&ndash; the quickness of the hand deceives the eye. The Government is a past master at the three card trick, as we have seen in the past two and a half years. It appears there are ways of getting around the minimum hourly wage of £4.40. Overtime, wet time, Sunday work and holiday time can be included in the calculation of the minimum rate. Workers may still earn £2.50 or £3 an hour. We have failed before we start and those being exploited will be outraged.</P>
      <P>A young person leaving school and entering employment is delighted to receive his or her first wage cheque. No matter how small the amount, the first wage cheque is important as it is money into their hands. However, then the expenses start &ndash; they are rightly expected to contribute at home, they may have to provide their own clothes and they have outgoings they did not have previously. Suddenly they are 18 years old, adults, and the meagre wages they thought were great are not sufficient. They are being used and abused. There is no doubt that ruthless employers have become wealthy on the backs of young workers. However, there are many considerate employers who understand they must look after their workers. What if this Bill does not address the problem of exploitation, as we are promising it will? Shortcomings have already been highlighted. Can these be addressed by amendments to the Bill in the time we have been given? It appears not. This Bill, which has been heralded for many years, will be makeshift. This is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> Workers are being exploited in a number of areas. It is important that people are rewarded for their work. Under this Bill, if a kind waitress is tipped by a couple having a meal, it will be taken into account when she is paid. This is outrageous and unacceptable. This is a small token of appreciation given by patrons of a restaurant, hotel or pub. Waitresses do an important job. We could not have a meal or a drink sitting at a table unless we had young girls or boys to serve us. Tips which are put in a jar and shared among them will be taken into account. The Minister should forget about this. This morning I spoke on the Social Welfare Bill, which contains outrageous anomalies. However, it is just as wrong to treat workers like this.</P>
    <P>Home helps are important in remote rural areas &ndash; perhaps they are not as important in Dublin or other urban areas where people have neighbours. Home helps look after old people, make them a cup of tea, help them into or out of bed and dress them. Those prepared to do this social work should not be exploited for their kindness. Their work should be rewarded by the State. The meagre wages they are paid are an insult. They are not working for the money, but they must be rewarded. I ask the Minister to take this on board. The Bill is important and I ask for more time to get it right so that when it is implemented we can laud ourselves for a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker said he was glad to follow a millionaire Deputy &ndash; I am equally glad to follow a small farmer from Cavan. Like most speakers, I welcome the Bill. However, it is disappointing that such compulsory legislation must be introduced and that in a tiger economy, every employee is not yet in receipt of what is considered a fair minimum wage. The Bill is fine in theory. However, in practice, its implementation and the result is best judged by the Government's budgetary policy. On the debate on the Finance Bill, many speakers referred to how people earning a minimum wage cannot receive their earnings tax free. This should not be an aspiration but fiscal policy. If one Minister states a worker must be paid a minimum wage to have a reasonable standard of living, the Minister for Finance should ensure tax free allowances are high enough to ensure it is not taxed. Hopefully, the Minister will respond to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An article in one of today's newspapers stated that up to 200,000 immigrant workers may be needed to fill existing vacancies. I hope that when this legislation is enacted, the rates of pay being offered will at least take up the slack among the unemployed. It is difficult to explain to our constituents that at a time when more than 100,000 people are out of work, many jobs cannot be filled. Low pay is probably the reason for that. I hope that equation will be resolved as a result of enactment of this legislation. If there is a need to bring almost 200,000 people into the country to work, perhaps we should offer more attractive <Col N="999" /> wage rates and more certainty in regard to those rates. That will address the problem.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published my party colleague, Deputy Owen, referred to the way the recent wage agreement among the social partners will have a bearing on this Bill; she may have referred to it again in her contribution. I wonder if the minimum wage as currently agreed will take into account the increases being provided for over the coming years under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The relatively modest increases being provided under that agreement will raise all boats to some degree but we must examine closely the way minimum wage rates will be calculated for the people at the lower end of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Boylan, referred to the people who are receiving scandalously low rates of pay from the State through the health boards under the home help scheme. As backbench Deputies, we find it difficult to explain to our constituents that the Minister is introducing a minimum wage while the Minister for Health and Children presides over a system where some people receive £2 or £2.50 per hour from the various health boards under the home help scheme. It does not make sense that one Minister is blatantly contradicting another Minister's stated aim and I would like to know what this Minister has to say in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have received quite an amount of correspondence on this legislation from the social partners and the demand being made most strongly by various unions relates to the need for a minimum wage of £5 per hour. In the era of the Celtic tiger, it is difficult to understand the reason the minimum rate should be set at a lower rate than that. The value of labour is what has driven this economy into such a strong position and we would not be enjoying that economic success were it not for the efforts of so many people over the past decade or so. We must reward the people at all ends of the spectrum who have contributed but we should also try to better the lot of those who are currently being paid £3, £3.50 or £4 per hour.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will help but until such time as we ensure, through our tax laws, that the person in receipt of the minimum wage is not losing money to the taxman every week, it is purely aspirational. The Minister for Finance has set the tax free allowances at such a rate that people on this so-called minimum level continue to pay a weekly tax.</P>

      <P>I am glad to speak on the Bill. This is important legislation. For many years, people who were not lucky enough to get a third level education raised their families by working in hotels, restaurants and pubs, washing floors and so on. Those people were badly treated by millionaire employers who could not pay them £2 per hour but who could, when the property next door came up for sale, spend £700,000 or £800,000 <Col N="1000" /> buying it. They had three or four holidays per year and drove a Mercedes or a BMW.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the women who suffered in the hotel and restaurant industries under employers who used and abused them. These women had to take whatever they were given because it helped to subsidise their incomes and allowed them to raise their families. In many cases, it was the only employment in their areas. I welcome this legislation and I know that there are many worried employers. Why would they not be worried? They are not used to paying high rates and they abused many of their employees.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker referred to the 100,000 immigrants coming to this country. I welcome the immigrants but I hope they will not be the new skivvies who will be used and abused for the sake of cheap labour. I hope their employers will not tell these people that if they open their mouths to complain, they will have them run out of the country. They should be protected as well as our own people, and not used and abused as was the case in the past. Over the years, many people were treated badly by their employers and they had no legal redress. I am glad to see the Bill come before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There has been some criticism of the reason it took so long for this legislation to come before the Dáil. Many people involved in the tourism trade are upset because they had to print their booklets and brochures without knowing what they would be paying their employees for the summer. Some of them will have to pay the going rate because it appears this legislation will pass through both Houses fairly quickly. It should be enacted by the summer so that the people who work in this industry on a seasonal basis can be paid at least £4.40 an hour.</P>
      <P>Two years ago &ndash; I have not been there since and will not go back &ndash; I visited Temple Bar where I had a meal with some friends of mine. When I received the bill I noticed there was a service charge, which is outrageous. There should not be a charge for service when one goes out for a meal. In addition, for the privilege of having a meal in Temple Bar, I was told I had to pay a tax. Surely that is illegal. Taxes cannot be charged like that. It is bad enough that the Government takes every penny out of our pockets. We were well charged for the food and drink, and we even gave a tip to the waiter &ndash; that was probably taken by the employer. I hope this matter will be dealt with in the Bill. Restaurant owners should not be allowed to add a service charge to the bill. We should be charged the price of the meal and if there is VAT on top of that, so be it, that goes to the State, but there should not be an extra tax for the privilege of being in Temple Bar. That is outrageous and it should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the home help service. We talk about scrupulous employers but the worst employer in the State has been the State itself. At one time the health boards were paying £1 per hour to home helps, although that has been increased substantially. Do they have any <Col N="1001" /> conscience? The chief executive of a health board would not go too far down the road for £1 an hour. It is a joke. It took about three years for those of us in the Western Health Board to get an increase for these people. I do not know the salary of the chief executive officer of the health board, but it is certainly a lot more than £1 an hour, and then there are expenses on top of that. It was women who suffered the most in this case because 99.9% of carers are women. Again, it is a case of it being all right because they are women. Women have been badly treated in this country.</P>
    <P>The women have raised families and have done a wonderful job. They have been wives, mothers and employers. I hope this Bill will protect women because they deserve such protection. They are great. There is a women's day but at some stage in the future the Government should pay a few pounds to women who stay at home. They should be looked after because they are good people.</P>

        <i> (Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister has single-mindedly pursued this issue in Government for the last three years. While there is criticism of the slowness in bringing the Bill before the House, it is welcome that it has been introduced. The Celtic tiger continues to roar and much of the country is benefiting enormously. However, there are still sections of the community which the economic boom has not yet visited. There are still many people living on small incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Wexford has a major problem with unemployment. While the rate in the rest of the country is down to 5% or 6%, it is still at 12% in Wexford. There is also a major problem in the county with early school leaving. I do not know <Col N="1002" /> why it is peculiar to Wexford but large numbers of young people drop out of second level education to go into employment and they are the workers who are most likely to experience exploitation. To date young people have not received an adequate or decent wage. Wexford does not have a third level college which, in itself, creates many problems. The county has one of the lowest entry levels to third level education.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a historic development. It is one of the most vital measures to have come before the House. It is a milestone in ensuring workers will be paid a reasonable hourly rate and in stopping scandalous exploitation of workers. We have all heard about low skill, low esteem, dead end jobs but I have expressed concern for some time about the jobs in a number of sectors, for example, hotels, supermarkets, tourism, petrol stations and hairdressing salons. These are sectors in which young people are being exploited daily. There are excellent employers in these areas as well but exploitation does occur there.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that some operators pay as little as £1.50 per hour. Deputy Ring referred to rates of £3 and £3.50 per hour. In some areas of my constituency pay can be as low as £1.50 per hour and in some cases it is less than that. We have the evidence. A constituent came to talk to me last week about getting a council loan. She was working for a doctor in the county and her income was £110 per week. She was paying £60 per week rent which left her with £50 to live on. I told her she had no hope of getting a loan on that income. I rang the local clinic to check if she would be eligible for supplementary rent allowance but the answer was that she was not because she was working. However, people who earn much more on social welfare get rent allowances. Lone parents and so forth receive a rent allowance on the same level of income. I have no problem with that, but problems such as this need to be addressed. I hope the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible and that it will deal with problems like that of my constituent.</P>
    <P>Constituents tend to come to their Deputies when they are seeking council loans. One does not have to be earning a large wage to qualify for a council loan but in some cases salaries are so low that the loans officer will point out that the person could not possibly afford the repayments on a council loan or even on a shared ownership loan. I hope the Bill will seriously address this problem.</P>
    <P>I was a little concerned about IBEC and the small business associations when they started to scream and roar about this legislation. The Celtic tiger is of benefit to the business community. There is low inflation, low interest rates and half a million more people are employed compared with ten years ago. That is the result of the policies pursued by different Governments during those years. No single Government can claim a monopoly of credit for the economy because different Governments continued to implement <Col N="1003" /> the policies introduced ten years ago. Most people have benefited from them.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as IBEC and the small businesses have a right to comment on policies but it is morally wrong of them to continue to defend the low wages which some workers are paid. It is also morally wrong to criticise the Minister for introducing a Bill which will guarantee a worker £4.40 per hour. In a time of prosperity we should probably seek to increase the amount and I am glad the Minister, in her discussions with the social partners, has concluded that it will increase to £5 per hour over the next two years. Hopefully, through the generosity of employers and honourable people in business, it might increase even more.</P>
    <P>Business and industry are making huge profits at present. There is no need for IBEC and the small business associations to be afraid of this legislation or to run away from it. There is no need to undermine the Government's intentions. They should accept the legislation in a spirit of goodwill. The Minister, Deputy Harney, has been reasonable in what she is asking from business. A 40 hour week at £4.60 per hour amounts to £184 per week. That is not a large amount of money but in some cases it might mean an extra £40 to £60 per week in take home pay. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the unholy hours young people are asked to work in hotels, supermarkets, petrol stations and in the horse industry. It has been brought to my attention that young trainees are being exploited in some sections of the horse industry. They are working for up to 80 hours per week and are not paid adequately. I hope the Bill will deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>There are poor working conditions for young people in many business sectors. It seems to be an attitude in the tourism industry, especially if they live in hotels, to give them some money, a bed and some food and assume they will be happy. I assure those in the tourism industry that these young people are far from happy and, as a public representative, I receive complaints on a regular basis from this sector. If the minimum wage does anything, it is important that it brings to heel that broad section of the tourism industry which is not paying its workers adequate wages.</P>
    <P>I have argued with different Ministers that there should be some scale of payment for trainees in the hairdressing industry. I have checked as recently as the past few days and have found that, in small towns especially, male and female trainee hairdressers earn in the region of £40, £50 or £60 per week. They are told they are learning a trade and that, when they are qualified, they will be able to earn a good living. It is not right that these people are exploited. Regularised payments should be introduced for people training in the hairdressing sector and other related professions.</P>
    <P>Home helps were mentioned and this is an issue not just on the western seaboard but throughout the country. While not wishing to <Col N="1004" /> criticise the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I hope the new Minister for Health and Children will introduce a reasonable and decent system of payments for people who provide home help. At present, they earn between £1.50 and £2 an hour, yet they save the Exchequer millions by keeping people out of hospital. In my area, it costs between £1,000 and £1,500 to keep a person in hospital. We want to pay small but decent amounts of money. In this day and age, £2 an hour is an insult to a person who provides home help and a tremendous service to the recipient, and who saves the State money.</P>
    <P>While we talk of bringing industry to heel in the area of low pay, we should follow suit in the area of home helps and the Minister should introduce a minimum rate of pay of £4.40 an hour for those people. That would not be expecting too much. We would be well repaid over the years by people being kept out of hospitals and living in and being part of the community. Usually women provide the home help service, although in my neighbourhood men also provide it. It is only right that they should be paid a decent and honourable hourly wage. Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister would listen to all sides of House and, in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children and his Department, examine the issue of introducing a minimum wage of £4.40 an hour for home helps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for affording me the opportunity to contribute briefly to this welcome debate. I express my appreciation to Evelyn Owens, the chairperson of the commission established to examine this area in 1997. The report of the national minimum wage commission was issued in April 1998 and it went into great detail, having obtained submissions from numerous bodies and having commissioned detailed research. Everything and anything we need to know about the national minimum wage issue is dealt with in the report of the commission.</P>
      <P>We may be one of the last countries in the European Union to have introduced this measure. It is something which should have been pursued more vigorously in the past. From reading the report, which details systems which operate throughout the world, it is evident that almost every country in world which has a thriving economy has some system in place to protect workers from the scourge of low wages. It has been stated that the system may lead to problems and these are dealt with in the report. Overall, such a measure would greatly enhance the prospects for increasing wage levels, reducing poverty and eliminating some of the handicaps many families have suffered because of low wages. Even though it is welcome, there are some side effects and these need to be examined and guarded against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which caused me concern when I was in the Department of Labour in 1980, when these issues were discussed under the partnership arrangements in place at the time, was dealing with the issue of underage people in <Col N="1005" /> employment and the manner in which they were exploited, especially in the larger towns. One of the main complaints 20 years ago, which is as relevant today as it was then, was that, although there was legislation to protect young people in employment from being exploited, a poor inspectorate was in place. Unless we put in place an inspectorate which will be effective in ensuring that the terms and conditions laid down in the Bill are enforced, the measure will fall far short of expectations. One of my major worries is that we might build up expectations for the legislation which may not be realised. It could also have some negative impacts and these need to be guarded against. One of the negative impacts may be an acceleration of young people leaving school because, in their short-term view, it is more economical for them to do so. This would be very damaging in the long-term and could mean the displacement of many low skilled workers. We need to guard against that.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback to hear a representative say during a radio discussion that the legislation should be postponed. It baffles me and, I am sure, many Members present how anyone involved in an organisation could say after three years of discussion and years of neglect on this issue that the April deadline is too soon and that it should be postponed. This has been heralded for a long time. There was an opportunity for three years to make submissions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the Minister published the legislation only a month ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen knew that as well as I did and that it was long overdue. For people in representative bodies to complain now that it is being introduced too soon, that they are not prepared and that it will cause chaos and confusion is an excuse for not being part of this arrangement. The social partners have a responsibility in this regard. As Members know, in the final analysis, many of the problems in this area will have to be worked out through social partnership and dialogue between ICTU, IBEC and the other organisations. There is a need to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not read the detail of the Bill because I did not have an opportunity to do so. It appears there were references in the report of the commission to a need to have a separate rate for those under 18. I am not sure how this will be dealt with, but perhaps it could be examined on Committee Stage. Apparently, according to the report of the commission, most countries where this structure has been put in place have separate rates for apprentices, people under 18 and others in similar categories. The main problem which will arise from the legislation is that, unless there <Col N="1006" /> is proper compliance and effective enforcement, especially through tax returns and a decent inspectorate, we face the prospect of the return of the black, blue or grey economy, or whatever one likes to call it. We will witness payments being made under the table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is essential legislation. I remember being at a Young Fine Gael meeting many years ago when Dr. FitzGerald was on one of his famous crusades. One of his ideas for economic and social progress was the introduction of a minimum wage. We had to wait a long time before we, as legislators, got the opportunity to introduce a minimum wage Bill. In general, it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Employers have taken advantage of and paid poor wages to a number of people. This has happened in the services industry generally. It is ironic that we are dealing with a minimum wage Bill when the economy has reached great height. The sting has been taken out of its introduction because the free market is also dealing with this issue in another way. I strongly suggest that, due to labour shortages, a large number of employers are finding it so difficult to keep employees that they have to increase wages to retain them. This situation has sorted itself out. However, legislation is required to put the payment of proper wages on a statutory basis. Many employers now have to pay over the £4.40 rate to ensure they keep employees. There is a valid argument for increasing the rate to £5 but we should concentrate on putting the payment of the minimum wage on a statutory footing and review it at a later date.</P>
      <P>For a small country &ndash; I say this about a great deal of legislation &ndash; we are good at introducing legislation but our policing of that legislation leaves a lot to be desired. It is of no benefit introducing legislation of this ilk if it is not properly policed. The Minister needs to take a look at that issue. If it is properly policed, employers who take advantage of employees will be weeded out and that is not a bad thing for society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the home help service referred to by other Deputies. It is appalling that a State body pays such measly wages to people performing such an excellent job. The Depart<Col N="1007" /> ment of Health and Children, through the health boards, is paying £3 or less an hour to people taking care of the elderly in our communities. One has only to look at the sheer economic value of the work they are doing compared to the emotional value in the sense that hospitalisation or institutionalisation of such people would result in a massive cost to the State. As Deputy Owen said, once this legislation is introduced the health boards will have no choice but to pay the minimum wage of £4.40 to those people. If the health boards do not introduce this rate how can we as legislators expect the private sector to do so. We cannot tell them they have to do it when semi-State organisations do not do so. That will not work. I am of the opinion that the proper rate will be paid to those workers once this legislation has been passed. We have a moral obligation to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne went a little overboard when he said the statements made by the Small Firms Association were immoral. That association represents employers who are concerned about the introduction of a minimum wage. I was raised in a small family run business. Many major employers are making a great deal of money. The number of young people employed by small family run businesses in many of our towns and villages is quite substantial. I can understand why they are concerned about the introduction of the minimum wage given the increase in overheads and competition which they have had to face over recent years. I can understand where the Small Firms Association is coming from. There has been a 20% increase in the rates payable by small businesses over the past five to eight years. Revaluations have, in many cases, quadrupled the rates which small businesses have to pay. They have had to pay increases in wages to ensure they kept employees. That is another overhead. Overseas competition has increased which has made it difficult for small family run businesses to survive. Such competition has also resulted in decreased margins. These are serious issues which the employer must take into consideration. It is right to say there are more employees in the country than employers but if one does not provide incentives to the employer, they cannot employ people. The minimum wage does not then come into consideration. In that context the concerns of small family run businesses are justified. Every public representative is aware of these businesses and the number of people they are employing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the introduction of a minimum wage. I hope it will be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister should be ashamed of herself, as should the Government on whose behalf she is acting, to come before this House with a Bill to fix the level of wages at the rate of £4.40 per hour. The Bill contains many loopholes which will be used by unscrupulous employers. There are more escape <Col N="1008" /> hatches in it than a badly holed sieve for recalcitrant employers who are already notorious for the low wage exploitation they operate as regimes in their workplaces. Instead of an outright onslaught on low pay, the Minister is giving these people one escape hatch after another.</P>
      <P>The sum of £4.40 an hour was first mooted two years ago and amounts to £171.60 for a 39 hour week or £8,923 per annum. That is the minimum wage which the Government believes it should be proud to introduce. Perhaps it is not surprising that the Government thinks it is doing the devil and all with this legislation. Ministers are light years removed from the living conditions of the low paid. When they exist on £90,000 plus a year, they begin to forget what it is like to exist on less than £9,000 or £15,000 a year.</P>
      <P>According to a Sunday newspaper, an Oireachtas committee, without any reference to me, has put in a pay claim for a minimum of 26% which would tie the wages of Deputies in with those of principal officers of Departments. This means a Deputy's pay would increase from £38,842 a year to £48,000, an increase of £10,000. Some Deputies believe they should be entitled to an increase greater than the entire sum of the minimum wage the Government is introducing. Perhaps the article in <i>Ireland on Sunday </i> which stated there were 24 millionaires in our midst might explain the indifference of many people in the Dáil. The plight of the low paid would not be the first thing on the agenda of a millionaire Deputy or legislator. They would not understand the problems of trying to exist on low pay.</P>
      <P>Let us take the price of a home. A young couple on the minimum wage worked out by the Government would receive the princely sum of less than £18,000 a year. If they go into a bank to try to purchase a home, they would be shown the door. This Bill does not bring within the ambit of low paid workers the beginnings of what would make for a life of reasonable comfort which every human being in our society deserves and to which they aspire. It is an insult to the low paid.</P>
      <P>Low pay is endemic in our society. The Socialist Party campaigned recently in towns and cities on a name and shame basis, whereby employees notified us of the amount they receive per hour. I am well aware of the difficulties which the poor and working people face, but I was taken aback by some of the levels of pay reported and confirmed. In one provincial town &ndash; I will not name it because it is happening in every provincial town and city, including Dublin &ndash; supermarkets were paying £1.75 per hour, security firms were paying £3 per hour and hotels were paying £3.50 per hour. Many swanky hotels are springing up as if the island was built on a gold mine and are thriving on the low pay exploitation of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official leadership of the trade unions stands indicted for the low pay exploitation of workers. It is incredible that the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of many unions, with some honourable exceptions, did not fight for the low paid years ago. They stand <Col N="1009" /> indicted for accepting £4.40 as a minimum wage. It is incredible that people who claim to be the leaders and representatives of working people would agree to the miserly wage of £4.40 per hour. They do not deserve the title trade unionists if that is their level of understanding and empathy with people who are trying to exist on low pay.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that there is still resistance among some employers. I was askance this morning to hear the chief executive of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland say he wanted the matter delayed. I was so incensed that I, along with my Socialist Party colleagues, will put a picket on its office in Merrion Square tomorrow morning to let it know how outraged low paid workers are that these privileged people should try to thwart the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic how the Government is going out of its way to facilitate Scrooge employers. The little extras workers in a restaurant depend on to make up a reasonable wage, such as tips, will now be counted as part of the minimum wage. The Irish Hotels Federation gloats about this in its most recent newsletter. It states that employers in the sector will be particularly welcome of the fact that basic pay items, such as service pay, shift premiums, bonuses, service charges and board and lodgings, will be reckoned when calculating the minimum wage. This is a shameful capitulation to low paying employers.</P>
    <P>A minimum wage of £5 per hour should be introduced immediately which would give workers £195 per week basic income. It should be tax free which would further increase the take home pay of workers by approximately £1,502 a year. That would be a significant step but it would only be the beginning. It should be increased each year by £1 until it reaches £8 per hour, the amount regarded as the decency threshold by an EU group. In order to highlight this, the Socialist Party, along with other groups and backed by some trade unions, will take to the streets of Dublin on Saturday, 11 March in a protest demonstration to demand £5 per hour which should be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>The exclusions are mind boggling. Far out relations, such as half brothers and half sisters, are excluded from the legislation. By doing so, the Government has acknowledged that the family may be subject to exploitation wages. Soldiers who spend long hours on Border duties and workers in uniform will also be excluded because of the miserly level of their take home pay. That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>Employers can use prescribed courses of study and training as an excuse not to pay workers. There will be more workers on study and training courses once this Bill is implemented than there has ever been in Irish history.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that people who start work at 18 or 19 years of age will only be entitled to 80% or 90%, respectively, of the minimum wage. The minimum wage should be £5 per hour tax free for all workers from 16 years of age.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business.   White Paper on Defence: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Wall on Tuesday, 29 February 2000:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">mindful of Ireland's current and developing national and international security and defence obligations and having regard to the ongoing internal security duties, aid to the civil power and other obligations of the Defence Forces;</P>
    <P Just="Center">condemns the Minister for Defence for his mishandling of the preparation of the White Paper on the Defence Forces and particularly for the damage caused by his reluctance to engage in a full and meaningful consultative process with senior military personnel, the representative bodies and the FCA;</P>
    <P Just="Center">deplores the serious damage to morale resulting from:</P>
    <P Just="Center">his attempts to reduce the establishment of the Defence Forces without a clear statement of military consequence of this course of action;</P>
    <P Just="Center">his long delay in publishing the White Paper;</P>
    <P Just="Center">his failure to implement the PriceWaterhouse recommendations on the Air Corps and navy, having appointed himself chairperson of the implementation group;</P>
    <P Just="Center">his poor planning and lack of consultation with the local communities in closing barracks, and</P>
    <P Just="Center">calls on the Minister for Defence to immediately review the contents of the White Paper, to take account of the concerns widely expressed and to bring forward realistic proposals for the future of the Defence Forces, based on Ireland's ongoing defence and peacekeeping commitments at home and abroad.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <P>We live in a changed Europe, a Europe no longer bitterly divided between two blocs but a Europe which is increasingly coming together in an enlarged union. We also live in a Europe where a new security architecture based on common values, new models of conflict prevention and, where necessary, conflict resolution is evolving. Europe is moving ahead on security co-operation and Ireland will face crucial decisions about the nature of its future role.</P>
      <P>Novembers' summit of Foreign and Defence Ministers in Brussels, the appointment of Javier Solana the former Secretary General of NATO as Common Foreign and Security Policy supremo of the EU and as Secretary General of the Western European Union, the Cologne Declaration, the St. Malo Declaration and the report of the three wise men on future EU evolution are clear indicators that security, common defence policy and even common defence are matters being discussed seriously at EU level. That the Government has participated in these discussions and acquiesced in these developments without adequate debate at home shows that the current Fianna Fáil dominated Administration has learned nothing from the mishandling of Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>The so-called White Paper on Defence is a further indication of how not to develop security or defence policy. It is not a White Paper on Defence, it is a White Paper on Defence Forces personnel. Worse still, this Government policy statement does not take account of Ireland's changing role in security through Partnership for Peace, the Petersberg Tasks of the EU and the evolving security and defence structures in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government mislead the people on PfP. Regrettably, Ministers continue to run away from proactively developing policy in this area or even explaining proposals or developments to the public. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue It is time for an open debate on Ireland's role in the evolving European security architecture. The White Paper should have dealt with those issues.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael favours joining a European defence entity, with an Article V protocol and based on principles which we recently set out in a policy document. It is time to stop developing this policy by the back door or on the basis of a nod and a wink. The Government must tell the truth about the situation in Europe. The White Paper is a missed opportunity to present those facts to the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have become alarmed recently at the degree to which the Government &ndash; this is not a personal criticism of the Minister, it is just <Col N="1012" /> a sign of the times &ndash; seems to be prepared to downgrade the Army. It appears to have reached the conclusion that the Army is no longer necessary. As Deputy Gay Mitchell said, we live in changing times and the demands and responsibilities placed on our Defence Forces are increasing. We need an Army which can be relied upon, whose members are satisfied and well equipped. In that context, it is ironic that we appear to be going in the opposite direction. We have downgraded the Army and closed down military installations while at the same time we have attempted to fund the its re-equipment on the basis of the sale of its assets. That is not possible. This is happening when, according to all reports, there has never been more money available for the Government to spend.</P>
      <P>It is a reversal of what is happening in other countries that we appear to be downgrading the military and pushing its needs further and further down the list. That is wrong. With the exception of the UK, Ireland has the longest coastline in Europe. We have an ongoing responsibility in that regard and a major level of investment will be required to meet the demands that will be placed on us in the future. If we fail to make that investment, we will pay a high price at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the current position and to address the issues to which I refer.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces are the central instrument of stability in this State. Since 1922 officers have never once been obliged to go to the media to voice their concerns on the management and direction of the Defence Forces. The Minister's inept handling of the preparation of White Paper and his lack of consultation with senior military personnel has forced representatives of the Defence Forces to publicly state their dismay, disappointment and disagreement with his proposals. The entire saga has unfortunately created an atmosphere of disillusionment which will take many years to repair.</P>
      <P>So great is the feeling of instability within the Defence Forces that officers are resigning their commissions at a rate of two to three per month. They are circulating their CVs and leaving because of disillusionment and collapsing morale. It is a sad day when the Chief of Staff threatens to resign. The situation is serious when the Minister loses the respect of the Defence Forces. When a Minister allows this to happen, he has damaged the entire force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that the wishes and the proposals of the Minister and the Government will be implemented because the Defence Forces will obey, at all times, the directions of the Government of the day. We realise that increased invest<Col N="1013" /> ment in the Defence Forces is needed, but should it have to come at such a price?</P>

      <P>When we debate the future of the Defence Forces, we must remember that we are discussing the careers of people and the livelihoods of families. Is it fair to threaten them with such instability? Is it any wonder that the Defence Forces personnel worry about their careers and the well-being of their families? It is a serious gamble to sacrifice one of the greatest institutions this country has produced.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. I represent a Border constituency and I take this opportunity to place on record my tribute to the Defence Forces for their contribution to keeping the peace between the North and the South during the past 25 years. Quite a number of those stationed on the Border made the ultimate sacrifice but their very presence was a source of comfort to many people living in lonely areas. We must not forget that. I am familiar with many of the personnel stationed at Cavan Army barracks and in Monaghan and I have the highest regard for them.</P>
      <P>I regret the unease and turmoil created by statements the Minister made in relation to cutbacks and closures of barracks. He has caused unnecessary unease and turmoil and people no longer know whether they have a future in the Army. The statements, counter-statements and press releases he has issued are not beneficial.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Gay Mitchell's launch of my party's policy in respect of the role of our Defence Forces in a united Europe. We have a positive role to play in that regard and we cannot play it unless the Army is placed on a sound footing, properly equipped and properly trained. The Government's current approach is to downgrade and belittle the Defence Forces that have served us so well since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, strutted across the stage of this House last night and his presentation reminded me of the antics of a half-baked dictator of a South American republic. His contribution on the motion before the House was snide, mean-minded, intimidatory, threatening and hare-brained. In his 11 page statement he managed not only to deride the comments of the Opposition, those of many of his party's backbenchers and those of the Progressive Democrats, but he also issued a clear threat to members of PDFORRA and RACO and anyone else who expressed an opinion on his performance that they would be singled out and punished in the long-term. He said that their actions would be long remembered. He stated &ldquo;It is regrettable that such a short-sighted approach was adopted by some which I assure people will be long remembered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The statement the Minister made last night is a clear and outrageous threat to serving members of the Defence Forces that they will be singled out in time and made to pay for anything they said. He should take the opportunity over the next 24 hours to withdraw that outrageous statement. I have never heard a Minister make such a statement. It demeaned politics and his office. He owes an apology to the House and should withdraw that threat to serving members of the Defence Forces. I hope he will take the opportunity to do so.</P>

      <P>In light of what Opposition Members have just said, they might be better off directing television programmes such as &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo;. I want to compliment and pay tribute to the Minister for Defence on the tremendous work he is doing with the Defence Forces. I also compliment and pay tribute to the Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his open and widespread consultation &ndash; which, perhaps, disappointed the Opposition &ndash; on the White Paper on Defence. It provides for the most significant development of the Defence Forces ever undertaken. It commits the Government to unprecedented and very substantial investment in <Col N="1015" /> equipment and infrastructural development over the next ten years. In recent years, considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Votes for new equipment and for providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces, which is very welcome. The Government fully intends to continue to modernise the programme to ensure the Defence Forces are equipped to the highest standards appropriate to their role.</P>
    <P>The new equipment and other measures contained in the White Paper will help to transform the Defence Forces and will bring about a quantum leap in their capacity to perform the full range of tasks at home and overseas. The White Paper sets out a general framework for unprecedented investment, initially totalling over £250 million. This initiative will transform the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy is to ensure the Defence Forces are adequately equipped to undertake any role assigned to them. Establishing realistic equipment requirements and priorities for procurement forms a major element of strategic planning activities within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. The object is to acquire, maintain and manage equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Defence Forces at the appropriate level of operational readiness in a cost effective manner, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>For many years, the imbalance between pay and non-pay allocation of the resources has led to a deficiency in the required levels of modern equipment. This White Paper has been designed to ensure resources are freed up in manpower and other areas and allocated to the acquisition of necessary equipment. Any re-equipment programme should be regular, sustained, consistent and reasonable, having regard to the tasks required.</P>
    <P>Since the completion of the 1994-95 efficiency audit group review, a substantial investment has been made in the modernisation of equipment, which I greatly welcome. The most important current programme is the acquisition of the new Mowag armoured personnel carriers for the Army. This is a major commitment, already made by the Government at a cost of £40 million for 40 APCs, which are due to be delivered in mid-2002. These vehicles will replace ones which first saw service in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his open consultation. The White Paper highlights the need to develop a more meaningful, co-ordinated combat development plan that would take a medium to long-term view of equipment purchase, replacement, upgrading and maintenance in a systematic manner across all units and services. That is the appropriate way to move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have got something right to get such a barrage of criticism from the Opposition. I commend him and all those who contributed to this report, particularly <Col N="1016" /> the various changes that have been made and agreed upon. I welcome the first ever White Paper on Defence. This programme of further development and expansion for the Defence Forces will build on the proud record achieved by the Defence Forces over the decades.</P>
      <P>I welcome the additional £250 million for investment in equipment for the Defence Forces covering the Air Corps equipment requirements, continued investment in the Naval Service with special emphasis on fishery protection which is of vital importance, a commitment to continuous recruitment to the forces allowing for an additional 750 personnel to be recruited immediately, a continued commitment to overseas participation in accordance with Government commitments and the development of the reserve defence force, with a commitment to improve training and equipment.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be parochial and to talk specifically about the Army barracks in Kilkenny. I thank the Minister for his commitment to that barracks. Since taking office, he has visited the barracks and given categoric assurances on its future, despite the consistent mischievous reports in the media and various leaks that one barracks might close as a result of this reorganisation. I am glad I had a meeting with the Minister at which he gave that firm commitment again. A mischievous attempt was made to set Kilkenny barracks against Clonmel barracks. They are totally different regions, in military terms.</P>
      <P>I cannot overemphasise the importance of the barracks to Kilkenny city, county and region. It is of huge social and economic benefit to the traders, suppliers and providers of services in its huge catchment area. I want to place on record my thanks for the Minister's commitment to that barracks and the many other barracks throughout the country. It was unfortunate that leaks occurred in an attempt to set personnel in different parts of the country against each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the White Paper, especially the vigorous public debate on the subject. Vigorous public debate has not characterised the history of the development of policy in relation to the Defence Forces. In the formulation of policy, matters have been left very much to the Department over the years. It is tremendous that the Minister has brought forward the first ever White Paper, which outlines comprehensively State policy in this area and sets out a framework for development for the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a very vigorous debate with the military staff on this subject. It is tremendous that this State is served by a military staff at general headquarters who apply their minds to these problems. It is very reassuring for the citizen to know there is a dedicated corps of people, who are highly trained and specialised in military science and who apply their minds to the practical problems and to the emergency and contingency planning required in a country such as this. There <Col N="1017" /> has been debate, discussion and dialogue between the Minister and the general staff. I think that is not a bad thing and that public respect for the Minister and the GHQ staff will be enhanced as a result of that process.</P>
    <P>As a private citizen, it was a revelation to realise that senior Army staff take their responsibilities so seriously and have a real conception of where the public interest in relation to defence matters lies. However, it falls to the Minister to make final decisions in the matter, which he has done and for which I commend him. That is democracy.</P>
    <P>The key feature of the White Paper is that a continuous programme of investment in equipment has been provided for. For too long, all the Defence Forces &ndash; the land forces, the Air Corps and the Naval Service &ndash; were ridiculed as Cinderella outfits, in terms of equipment. There were tremendous developments in the Defence Forces following our entry into United Nations active service. There have been tremendous developments in the Naval Service since our accession to the European Community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement today in relation to the Air Corps, which is very important. I had raised with him the question of the safety of personnel in regard to Air Corps equipment. It is very important to have a continuous programme of investment in proper equipment for the Air Corps and that it is given a defined mandate and role. One of the problems with the Air Corps over the years was the lack of a clear concept of its role, in terms of the overall military organisation. I welcome that announcement by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House will speak about the importance of certain key installations in their constituencies. I am fortunate in that I do not have a key installation to defend but as an observer of defence debates over the years it seems that military experts have always insisted that we have too many military installations. This is not a popular point to make but a balance must be struck. The growth of the economy in future years will raise questions about the need for so many installations as a permanent feature of our defence arrangements. We will have to look at this issue in the future if we want an efficient and respected Army which is able to perform and concentrate on its tasks in the best traditions of our Army, Óglaigh na hÉireann. The White Paper resolves matters for the future and I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>

However, today's major announcement is for £55 million for new aircraft and developments at Casement Aerodrome. For all its huffing and puffing, the rainbow Government did nothing during its term of office.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service last purchased a ship in 1986. The <i>LE Roisín</i> was recently commissioned for £23 million and a new ship has been ordered at the same price or less. Between 1994 and 1997 the rainbow Government purchased no ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and to compliment the Minister and his officials on bringing forward a progressive policy document. I remind Opposition Deputies that the last debate on the Defence Forces during Private Members' time was during the lifetime of the rainbow Government. At that time morale was at an all time low in the Defence Forces. You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I put questions to the then Minister concerning the Government's failure to pay members of the Defence Forces for additional <Col N="1019" /> duties they undertook as a result of the BSE difficulties on the Border. These payments were not made until the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, took office in June 1997. This highlighted the rainbow Government's commitment.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this Government recognised the importance of having a proper structure for the Defence Forces and sufficient personnel. When Opposition spokesperson on defence, Deputy Michael Smith promised that when in Government Fianna Fáil would produce a White Paper on Defence. I am glad that this paper, which outlines the long-term strategic plan for the Defence Forces, has been brought forward during the first half of the Government's five year term.</P>
      <P>Members appreciate the wide range of activities carried out by the Permanent Defence Force, ranging from service abroad to mercy missions at home. All too often the diversity and importance of these activities is not fully appreciated by the public. There has been a strong and sound Army tradition in my constituency and generations of families from my county have given and continue to give dedicated and loyal service to the State. Many members of the Defence Forces from my county have served and continue to serve with great distinction on difficult missions abroad.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in Government has always demonstrated the need to provide ongoing investment in the provision of adequate facilities for the Defence Forces. While in Government it placed the contract and paid for the construction of the new Dún Uí Néill Barracks in Cavan town. The provision of this barracks ensured that members of the Defence Forces stationed locally have the most up-to-date facilities available. It is an excellent headquarters for the 29th battalion.</P>
      <P>The presence of the Defence Forces is of enormous social and economic value to the towns in which they are located. The people of Cavan and Monaghan realise the crucial importance of these barracks. Personnel based there play an important and positive role in their local communities. These people have given this State total commitment, often in difficult circumstances, particularly in Border areas.</P>
      <P>The White Paper provides for a £250 million investment programme which will enable the further development of the Permanent Defence Force. The Minister has ensured that the Defence Forces will be properly resourced and equipped and the continuous recruitment provided for will ensure an appropriate age structure. The commitment of the Minister and the Government will ensure that personnel working overseas will be properly equipped and that safety will be paramount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the 6,000 Civil Defence volunteers engaged in important community work providing first aid, rescue and land and water searches. I compliment the Minister, his officials and the Government on bringing forward a progressive policy which will ensure stability and <Col N="1020" /> continuity in the work of the Defence Forces which is so important to the State.</P>

      <P>We have a high regard for the Defence Forces in Cork and we are proud that the headquarters of the southern command is based at Collins Barracks, for which there is great affection as part of Cork's heritage. In the past four years over £3 million has been spent on building works in Collins Barracks as a result of the Minister's initiative. This year new projects costing £7 million will commence at the barracks under the barracks reinvestment programme. Work has already started on a new men's dining hall costing £1.7 million, work on a new NCOs' mess costing £1.4 million will commence shortly and before the end of the year work will be under way on a new armoury and gymnasium costing £5.2 million.</P>
      <P>Undertaking these substantial new infrastructural projects became possible because of revenues from the disposal of barracks and savings achieved in Army payroll costs. These projects provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to develop and invest in the Defence Forces, a commitment copper-fastened by the White Paper, for which I congratulate and thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am proud to be a member of a Government which has produced such a far-sighted and comprehensive White Paper and compliment the Minister and his advisers on their efforts. I will support the Government's amendment to the motion.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the White Paper which is a milestone in the history of the nation and the Defence Forces. At last the Defence Forces have been put on a sound long-term footing. For 20 years there has been widespread awareness and consensus that the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces had to be modernised as its basic underlying framework had remained unchanged for decades. The Price Waterhouse review provided an opportunity to address many issues in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps which required attention.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of these issues have been the subject of public debate for a considerable period of time. When the Defence Forces review implementation plan of 1998 was adopted by the Government it was on the basis that it was the first phase of a radical and far-reaching reform process which would take ten years to complete. It fell to this Government to produce the first White Paper on Defence and we have given strong and courageous leadership when it was most needed. We knew that we would be criticised by those who believe that sensation, hysteria and diatribe are more important than <Col N="1021" /> calm analysis, strategy and planning, but we did not hesitate to take the tough decisions needed to turn the Defence Forces around.</P>
      <P>This White Paper sets out a ten year strategy and earmarks the funding necessary to produce a world class defence force. We will not rest on our laurels until the job is done and we have developed the best defence force possible.</P>
      <P>We start from a solid foundation. Irish troops serving overseas have attracted commendations and acclaim for the consistently high standards they have maintained over the years as peacekeepers, often in very difficult circumstances. They have a proud record and tradition and are deserving of our congratulations. It is in their role as peacekeepers that the professionalism of members of the Defence Forces comes to the fore. Irish soldiers have built up an enviable international reputation as peacekeepers, many of them from Cork city and county.</P>
      <P>Service with the United Nations demands a wide range of skills and personal qualities. Frequently, patience and diplomacy are as necessary as the conventional military skills of the soldier. Decades of experience have shown that Irish soldiers have these qualities in abundance and the number of requests the Government receives from the United Nations confirms the high regard in which Irish soldiers are held. The contribution made to peacekeeping operations has enhanced the prestige of Ireland internationally and has been a source of pride to all Irish people. Throughout the country the Defence Forces are held in high esteem and make a valuable contribution to their local communities.</P>
      <P>I welcome the White Paper and the Government amendment to the motion which will be carried tonight.</P>

      <P>In Opposition I worked with the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, and we gave a commitment when we published our own policy document that we would bring forward a White Paper on Defence. It gives me a certain personal satisfaction that day has finally come.</P>
      <P>Being from Kildare, I have lived all my life among Army personnel. Those of us from Kildare have an appreciation of the role and importance of the Army. In some sections of the country and in the media there exists a certain ignorance about the role and function of the Defence Forces. Often it is only when a crisis erupts and Army personnel are called in to provide necessary services or when bodies return home from overseas service, as happened recently, that we realise the sacrifices Army personnel make in the name of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious, therefore, for this matter to be dealt with properly. Following the publication of the Price Waterhouse report, a certain strategy was adopted and we promised the Army a brighter future. Major changes had to be made and were made. At that time we reduced the <Col N="1022" /> numbers in the Defence Forces to 11,500. This was done to provide a more mobile and efficient defence force. To do that the Minister closed some barracks. I agreed with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagreed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make sense to keep the same number of barracks open if numbers are to be reduced by another 1,000.</P>
      <P>The publication of the White Paper has caused much controversy, much of it unnecessary. There was very little difference between what the Chief of Staff and the Defence Forces were trying to achieve and what the Minister for Defence was trying to achieve. It was unfortunate that such controversy erupted and spilled over into the media. It did the Government and the Defence Forces no good. I am glad that the Minister met the Chief of Staff last week and that agreement was finally reached about the future role of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the investment planned for the Defence Forces and anyone familiar with the situation will realise how necessary it is. Apart from the investment in infrastructure and equipment, the new powers for the Chief of Staff are very important. He will become more of a chief executive with a more hands-on approach to problems within the Defence Forces. We are fortunate that the Chief of Staff has the respect of all ranks within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to all who have been following this debate that there is a serious lack of trust between the military and the Department of Defence. That lack of trust existed long before Deputy Michael Smith became Minister for Defence. It is not in the country's interests to see that lack of trust continue. I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach to rectify that problem.</P>
      <P>There is a saying in Kildare that a good soldier never looks behind. We have reached agreement on the future of the Defence Forces and it is now time to work together to ensure the recommendations are implemented.</P>

      <P>My constituency has a long association with the Defence Forces through James Stephens Barracks. I recognise the important role of the Army, not just in the economic infrastructure of the county, but in terms of the social contribution made by its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper has been brought about through public debate and debate with the officers and is to be welcomed. Its presentation will mean that we can positively restructure the Army itself and restructure the barracks. Like my constituency colleagues, I acknowledge that the Minister took time out to examine James Stephens Barracks and that he made it clear it would not close. It is now part of the headquarters structure of the Defence Forces. Given the location of the barracks in Kilkenny city within the tax designated area, I would welcome its development. I ask the Minister to look at James <Col N="1023" /> Stephens Barracks when looking at the development and refurbishment of barracks, and to ensure the site and the listed buildings in it are properly refurbished and put to a use within the structure of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>A move of this nature could lead to the decentralisation of the Defence Forces to Kilkenny city. The city has much to offer &ndash; the barracks is a fine site and there is a considerable respect for the Defence Forces in the region. I recommend the barracks as a location for decentralisation. In line with good practice and the development of such barracks, decentralisation should be part of the package of extension of the Defence Forces activity. The site should be retained as a fully fledged headquarters with a unit attached to it and we should spend whatever is necessary to upgrade all the buildings there.</P>
    <P>I commend the White Paper and look forward to working with the Minister to ensure the full development of James Stephens Barracks.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Penrose and O'Sullivan. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I pay tribute to the contributions of Deputies Wall and Fitzgerald to the debate on the White Paper over a number of months.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy in the House is well aware of the tension, suspicion and mistrust which the Minister's handling of the White Paper has caused among all ranks of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>This mistrust has been growing over the past number of months and has culminated in the unprecedented rift we have witnessed between senior officers and the Minister, especially in recent weeks. At all times Deputies Wall and Fitzgerald have acted responsibly in trying to impress on the Minister the negative effect caused by his belligerent and short-sighted approach to the White Paper. True to form he turned a deaf ear. His arrogant behaviour has led directly to the crisis that has occurred in recent weeks and he has nobody to blame but himself. He would be better employed seeking to rebuild his relationship with the Defence Forces rather than making condescending, groundless and ignorant comments across the floor of the House, as he chose to do last night.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the Opposition parties and some of his backbenchers were recently briefed by the representative bodies? Has he not read the extensive coverage of this row in the media, including the editorials in this morning's newspapers? He should realise he is not the only one who is correct in this debate. He needs to come out of his cocoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces have been under constant review since 1990, beginning with the Gleeson commission, followed by the first and second reports of the efficiency audit group, the Price Waterhouse report of 1994, the Defence Forces reorganisation plan of 1996 and the 1998 Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps and the <Col N="1024" /> Naval Service. Initially, many in the forces had hoped the White Paper would bring an end to this constant process of review and they expected that it would chart a new course for the Defence Forces in a rapidly changing domestic and international security situation. The turmoil of the past number of weeks and the documents produced yesterday demonstrate how misplaced were these hopes.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Minister decided that the White Paper process presented him with another opportunity to cut a swathe across the ranks of the Defence Forces and to cut back further on personnel numbers, to their lowest in living memory. It is a miserable attitude for a Minister to adopt and all the bravado this Minister has mustered cannot hide the shambles he has made of the White Paper process. It will go down as one of the disasters of his term of office.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday evening the Minister did not even have the good grace to acknowledge that the document launched yesterday afternoon was not the White Paper on Defence. It was left to the Taoiseach to respond to my party leader Deputy Quinn on the Order of Business and confirm that the final text of the White Paper will not be published for another three weeks. At the very least, the Minister could have admitted this last night. Instead he delivered a disgraceful threat to those who are critical of his approach. He threatened everybody, including the members of the Opposition, directly and democratically elected to this House, who were highly critical of the manner in which he handled the White Paper, and the members of the representative bodies who legitimately articulated the genuine and well founded concerns of members of the Defence Forces. Did the Minister also challenge the senior officers in the Defence Forces in a bid to invest a degree of credibility in the White Paper? He should withdraw his threats because nobody in this House will be frightened by them. They amount to unwarranted comment.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night the Minister did not confirm that two sections of the military, the Director of the Air Corps and the Director of Training, would be moved to Clonmel. Expectations of this relocation were raised in Clonmel since a report to this effect first appeared in the media last week. The Minister confirmed the Roscrea decentralisation but not the Clonmel one. I hope this omission will not be interpreted as a backtracking on his part. Doubtless his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, Deputy Davern, will ensure that the commitment will be met.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to Lieutenant General Dave Sapleton, a Clonmel man, who over the last number of weeks has played a major role in this debacle. The extent of the crisis which the Minister has created required the Chief of Staff to return from East Timor to challenge his proposals. It is unprecedented in my time in this House and within the memories of the other <Col N="1025" /> Members that there should be such a rift between the most senior professional Army officer and the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The agreement the Chief of Staff secured last week is important and I hope it will contain the great disappointment and disillusionment the Minister has created throughout all ranks of the Defence Forces. However, I cannot understand why he omitted the text of the agreement from the draft White Paper he published yesterday. It seems that even at the eleventh hour he cannot play a straight hand when dealing with the Defence Forces. The omission of the agreement caused great concern yesterday afternoon and called into question the Minister's commitment to deliver on it. The evasion he engaged in at the press conference yesterday only served to compound the sense of grievance we all hold. Again, it was left to the Taoiseach, the settler of all the Government's problems, to clarify the position on the Order of Business. Surely he must be increasingly frustrated at the incompetence and arrogance of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party have a fundamental problem with the proposal to sacrifice up to 1,000 trained and dedicated soldiers to purchase essential armaments and up to date equipment. When the coffers of the Minister for Finance are overflowing surely now is the time to properly equip the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service and the Air Corps, from central funds and not from penny pinching savings in the defence budget gained at the expense of important and loyal personnel. We in this House are prepared to support any proposals by the Minister for additional capital spending on equipment <i>via</i> a supplementary budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take on the Minister for Finance rather than the members of the Defence Forces. The departure of Ray Burke from the House in disgrace has left a void in the Fianna Fáil Party ranks which the Minister believes he should fill as the new Rambo of that party. It seems he believes he can single-handedly take on the questionable mantle of that forgotten voice. This may go down well in the assembled cumainn chairs, who will provide the echo of the hollow applause at this weekend's Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, but the members of the Defence Forces at all levels have a different take on the arrogant and ignorant stance on the White Paper adopted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If it was not for the goodwill and foresight of the senior personnel in the Defence Forces, the White Paper would have been an even greater disaster. It is a shame that the men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the State must put up with such a level of ministerial incompetence, bungling and arrogance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the motion. I am also glad the Labour Party has moved it because of the appalling and shocking manner in which the Minister for Defence has handled the process leading up to the publication of the White Paper on Defence. Since the debate on the White Paper began some months ago the Minister has adopted an antagonistic and belligerent approach to the Defence Forces and he has gone a long way towards destroying trust between them and his Department. I am glad Deputy Power recognised that tonight.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has adopted an arrogant and superior attitude in dealing with senior military officers, the representative organisations RACO and PDFORRA and the FCA. When the process underpinning the White Paper began, a format for partnership and consultation with the Defence Forces was set out, but for a reason known only to the Minister this process was completely ignored. Since 1987 the partnership model has underpinned our progress, but the Minister decided to dismiss the process. For example, the civil-military working groups were never convened to the best of my knowledge. In addition, the officers nominated by the general staff of the Army and the representatives of GOCs to fill the appointments to the working groups were left in a vacuum. In effect, the senior military staff in the Defence Forces were completely excluded from this vital stage of the process. It is incredible that officers with expertise and knowledge about the future needs of the Defence Forces were ignored.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, hardly any of the submissions made by the Defence Forces on the White Paper in November 1999 are included in the White Paper published yesterday. I do not understand why the significant contributions and concerns expressed are not reflected in a significant way. Why did the Minister have a consultative process if he was going to ignore it?</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept responsibility for the leaking of the White Paper. The Minister became quite agitated when this was raised in the House by our party spokesperson on defence, Deputy Wall. Stories stating that the Defence Forces were facing massive cutbacks and redundancies made banner headlines in the national and provincial media. I am one of the few Deputies with two barracks in their constituency &ndash; Custume Barracks in Athlone and Columb Barracks in Mullingar. It had a significant impact, not only on the morale of the Defence Forces personnel serving in the barracks, but also on their families. I was at a funeral today where a former sergeant was burying his wife, which was attended by many former Army personnel. To use a local phrase, they would not drink the Minister's blood, such was the degree of anger. They were absolutely furious with the Minister, and he will get a hot reception if he arrives in Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the leaks were part of a clumsy strategy designed to soften resistance to the White <Col N="1027" /> Paper from within the ranks. However, the leaks only served to damage the morale and confidence of all ranks in the Defence Forces. I have never been a member of Government but I know it has a job to do. However, when preparing documents the relevant bodies should be consulted and there should not be leaks to journalists or anyone else before the people directly concerned get the final copy. I do not know where the strategy of leaking documents originates, but much work will have to be done to repair the damage in this case.</P>
    <P>From a cursory reading of today's newspapers it is clear the Minister has not changed his approach. I do not understand why the Minister, either by addendum or annex, did not ensure that the agreement he reached with the Chief of Staff of the Army was not included in the White Paper. It was necessary for the Taoiseach to clarify the issue in the House today. The buck stops with the Minister for Defence and the failure to include the necessary and relevant documentation is a failure on his part. Yesterday he tried to separate elements of the agreement by saying some were administrative, some essential and some core. It is either all duck or no dinner with a document. It should include everything and issues should not be segregated in a ham-fisted manner. Basically, the Minister did not like some of the administrative elements and this was an attempt to exclude them. However, the document has been signed by both parties and I hope its status is reinforced by the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to issue a clear and unambiguous statement to end the confusion and misinformation surrounding the agreement between him and the Chief of Staff. That agreement must be honoured in full. We might as well tear up the White Paper if there is any deviation from it, and the process will have to begin again. The Minister is not a fool and knows that honouring the agreement in full is essential.</P>
    <P>The White Paper represents a missed opportunity. For the first time in the history of the State the Government decided to publish a White Paper, a positive move, to map out the future role of the Defence Forces and to ensure it can meet its domestic and international commitments. It should not have been designed as a vehicle to secure further reductions in the strength of the Defence Forces. The only thought in the minds of accountants and economic gurus who consider such document is value of money and bottom line economics. They conclude that the quickest solution is to get rid of personnel. Of course, they do not look at the long-term duties and obligations which we have taken on under Partnership for Peace, other international obligations and the obligations of the Defence Forces as an aid to the civil power in the State.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is being used as a method of implementing severe cutbacks and redundancies. First, it was said that six barracks would be sold and that the money would be used for re-equipment and the upgrading of existing equipment. <Col N="1028" /> This is important as it is necessary that the Army has up to date technology and new equipment. However, this did not seem to be enough as the money saved in reducing the strength of the Army will also be used in this regard. The Army is sufficiently important to receive a significant element of public expenditure under the Department of Defence, as do other Departments. The Department of Defence should not be treated as the Cinderella among Departments, with whatever is left over after dealing with the other Departments being given to it. However, this is how matters have been handled. The White Paper is primarily motivated by budgetary arithmetic, not by national defence interests.</P>
    <P>I can see the handy work of the Minister for Finance all over the White Paper. He is not satisfied with taking on the credit unions. He will only be happy when barracks have been closed and sold. He differs fundamentally and philosophically from my view of life, although both of us seem to have started from the same background. If he got his way there would only be 8,500 members in the Defence Forces. It is mind-boggling that the Government is adopting such a narrow, penny-pinching approach towards the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on 15 February I was informed that Ireland's spending on Defence as a percentage of GDP had fallen significantly since the Government came to office. Spending on Defence in 1997 was 0.95% of GDP, falling to 0.85% in 1998 and to 0.8% in 1999. The figures show that in comparison to other EU countries, Austria and Ireland have the lowest spending on defence. Given the amount of money at the disposal of the Government we should at least ensure spending on defence as a percentage of GDP remains constant at around 1%. It is unacceptable that the Government is allowing the figure to fall. If it is allowed fall much further the commitments given will run into trouble. It is critical that the White Paper should have been used to reappraise the levels of defence expenditure and examine the non-pay items over the years. We are only spending between 50% and 60% of what is the norm in the EU. We will find it extremely difficult to fulfil our international commitments under Partnership for Peace and the UN with such funding.</P>
    <P>Military barracks throughout the country play a very important economic and social role in the livelihoods of the towns in which they are based. I represent a constituency with two major barracks &ndash; Columb Barracks in Mullingar and Custume Barracks in Athlone. Columb Barracks is most important to Mullingar and we are rightly proud of the military tradition of service at home and abroad by personnel in both barracks. In addition, the barracks in Mullingar makes a huge contribution to the local economy. Currently, 278 people work in the barracks, of which 248 are enlisted personnel and commissioned officers with a further 25 civilian staff. It is estimated that <Col N="1029" /> the barracks injects about £5 million into the local economy on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Columb Barracks is the home of the Fourth Field Artillery Regiment. It is the last remaining artillery barracks in the country.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the contents of paragraph 4.316 of the White Paper which states that &ldquo;the revision to the existing structure is likely to involve some reductions in artillery&rdquo;. Kildare and Ballincollig artillery barracks were closed in 1998 and a further reduction would have a severe impact on the barracks.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a commitment in his press release yesterday that a reduction in numbers would not involve any redundancies or the closure of barracks. I seek an assurance from the Minister on behalf of the people in Mullingar that there will be no redundancies there. We have already taken a hit. In November 1998 a unit based in Mullingar, the Fourth Field Supply and Transport Company, was disestablished with personnel transferring to Athlone. The artillery company is all that is left.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Custume Barracks is of vital importance to the economic and social fabric of Athlone. It is currently the headquarters of the Western Brigade and is a source of great pride. I was shocked to read a report in <i>The Westmeath Examiner</i> on 11 February that Custume Barracks is experiencing a brain drain and that is a major worry. The report stated:</P>
    <P>With greater employment opportunities in the IT sector, among others, there has been a tendency among the middle rank personnel to seek employment in the private sector where the future is not so uncertain. The Minister for Defence must accept that he is responsible for causing the widespread uncertainty throughout the Defence Forces which has caused many people to consider their future in the Defence Forces and we must end this uncertainty once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister has only himself to blame for the mess he is in and none of it would have arisen had he listened to the reasonable concerns of the representative organisations. Containing expenditure to a fixed amount undermined the entire process and that was a failing. As my colleague, Deputy Ferris, said the Minister for Finance won the battle hands down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time so that I can also support my colleagues in condemning the Minister for Defence for the complete mess he has made of the White Paper and for his serious undermining of the morale of the Defence Forces. This debacle, which has resulted in a head to head between the chief of staff and the Minister, will have a serious long-term effect with them backing down at the eleventh hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A former chief of staff was reported in one of today's newspapers as saying there is rampant <Col N="1030" /> mistrust between all sides in the Defence Forces. This should be totally condemned. I have had contact with the Defence Forces twice. I visited the Lebanon as part of an Oireachtas delegation and we saw at first hand the professionalism of the Army in its work overseas and the enormous effect that it had in dealing with the difficulties encountered by the people in south Lebanon. My other contact is with some of the 343 soldiers based in Sarsfield Barracks. I assure the Minister that barracks will not be undermined in any way by his ham-fisted approach to defence issues. Limerick has a strong military tradition going back to Patrick Sarsfield and I want an assurance from the Minister that it will not be undermined. The same can be said for barracks throughout Ireland and my colleagues have referred to those in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of worry, concern and uncertainly about the future of the Defence Forces and I put that down to the Minister's handling of the issue. It is a terrible shame in this time of prosperity, as Deputy Penrose said, that the Minister for Finance has won the argument. The Minister for Defence has not done his job properly in standing up for the forces for which he is responsible. As a result, there is a total mess for which the Minister and the Government are responsible. Ireland has a strong military tradition with the Defence Forces, of which it can be proud, and unfortunately, they have been undermined by everything that has happened in recent weeks in regard to the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Ferris and Penrose for sharing time with me on this important issue. The publication of a Government White Paper on Defence should be a happy occasion as it should set out the strategic view of Government and outline forward looking proposals for defence personnel. However, the manner in which the Minister for Defence has handled its publication, as he spent weeks engaged in defensive and offensive activity against the Defence Forces, means that the White Paper has become a farce.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Power's contribution because he had the guts to come into the House and tell the Minister for Defence and his own party the real position. Given that a large number of Army personnel reside in his constituency he has first hand knowledge of the feeling on the ground on these issues. The decision by the Minister to reduce numbers is not acceptable, particularly given Ireland's new obligations in regard to EU peacekeeping and UN activities.

    <P>Prior to the reorganisation of the Army, undertaken by Fianna Fáil following an economic report by Price Waterhouse, the Permanent Defence Force personnel numbered 18,000. This number was reduced to 11,500 in November 1998, a massive reduction of 36%. The Minister for <Col N="1031" /> Defence is attempting to reduce numbers further to 10,900. The current strength of the Defence Forces is the minimum necessary to fulfil our domestic and international obligations. The Minister, through the manner in which he handled the consultations on the White Paper, has damaged morale unnecessarily, has deliberately, in an unprecedented manner, engaged in weeks of provocation and maintained his belligerent attitude when he ominously threatened people by saying that recent comments and views expressed by senior Army, navy and Air Corps personnel would not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>Since the foundation of the State, we have been fortunate to have such a loyal and dedicated Army. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service have served the country at home and abroad. The Defence Forces have always been subject to the directions of this House and the Government, have always obeyed orders and this will continue. However, following the row between the Minister and the Defence Forces, there appears to be considerable mistrust and suspicion among the Defence Forces, the Government and the Department of Defence. It is regrettable, sad and wrong.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's contribution last night and I hope he withdraws the statement he made. It will be a major mistake on his part if he allows it to remain on the record. He said &ldquo;It is regrettable that such a short-sighted approach was adopted by some which I assure people will be long remembered.&rdquo;. On a previous occasion a member of the Fianna Fáil Party threatened a soldier and the then President ensured that it was noted on the soldier's record that no action would be taken against him.</P>

      <P>Previous speakers have suggested that the proposals contained in the White Paper will in some way undermine morale in the Defence Forces. The Government's decision to introduce a White Paper will restore morale and end the indecision and anxiety which has existed for far longer than ten years. I served as Minister for Defence for a short time. Above all, the White Paper will end the apprehension which has prevailed for more than ten years in regard to the Defence Forces' future prospects. That anxiety, indecision and apprehension about the future brought the women of the Army onto the streets more than ten years ago in a bid to get some action. The unhappy situation which has prevailed in the Army is not of the current Minister's or any recent Minister's making.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the White Paper offers the prospect of a blueprint for the future development of the Defence Forces. It will restore confidence among Army personnel and in the Army and, above all, it will chart the course of the Defence Forces for the foreseeable future, thereby enabling the Defence Forces to continue to play an important role nationally and internationally as it has in the past.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, a man I have known for the past 27 years. He is an able, sincere and firm man who is committed to the task in hand and he is respected for that. Army personnel would have very little respect for the Minister if he did not face up to and tackle the problems which have undermined the Defence Forces for a long time. Those problems must be rectified and this White Paper, which will provide for the most sustained programme of investment ever seen in the Defence Forces, will restore confidence and morale in the Army and chart its future for the next ten years. Its recommendations will result in a modern, world class defence force, one of which we will all be proud.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to her visit the Lebanon. I also visited the Lebanon. In the days of indecision, I signed the document which resulted in the establishment of PDFORRA and RACO. Those organisations have made an enormous contribution to the development of the Defence Forces and we should recognise and applaud that. They would not respect any Minister who was not prepared to engage in negotiation and hard bargaining with them to ensure that the necessary measures will be put in place over the next ten years in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £215 million will be invested in new equipment and infrastructure. Only today we witnessed the start of that with the Minister's <Col N="1033" /> announcement of a £55 million investment in the Air Corps over three years. I commend the Air Corps on its valuable search and rescue service which is second to none and which has saved many lives around our coast from the Shannon basin to Finner and along the east coast. Perhaps some consideration might be given to the establishment of an air ambulance service which would operate in conjunction with the search and rescue service. An air ambulance service is badly needed and Ireland is unique in Europe in not having one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to Kickham Barracks in Clonmel which I had the opportunity to visit. The Minister already addressed this issue through a parliamentary question in which he stated that Clonmel will feature in the decentralisation process.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is an excellent development, one which all sides should overwhelmingly support in order to encourage the development and consolidation of the Defence Forces which are the envy of many European countries.</P>

      <P>This Minister for Defence, who is well liked by all of us, is not the first Minister to experience difficulty in bringing a White Paper to conclusion within Cabinet. Delays of up to two and three months are not the sole prerogative of the current Minister. However, he has created a new precedent through the introduction of a serial White Paper. We had the White Paper published two days' ago which we now find is incomplete according to comments made earlier by the Taoiseach. The final printed form will contain some of the side agreements which were made at the eleventh hour, nay at three minutes to midnight, in order to assuage the genuine worries and fears of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>As the White Paper has been in gestation for more than a year, it is a reflection of extraordinary political incompetence within the collectivity of the Cabinet that at such a late stage in the day, the Chief of Staff cut short his visit to East Timor in order to make a final appeal to the Department of Defence to alter some of the contents of the White Paper. We are not party to internal negotiations but neither are we ignorant. I am making a political rather than a personal charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The serial White Paper is the first of its kind but the serialisation of policy is not unique to the Minister for Defence. We have witnessed a serial, soap opera of a budget and Finance Bill to which successive changes have been made according to how vociferous particular interest groups have been. We have witnessed the nonsense whereby the Minister for Finance in a Cabinet, which according to our Constitution is supposed to have collective responsibility, refuses to meet with representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions <Col N="1034" /> and whereby an Independent Deputy, by way of compromise, forces a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Compounding the farce, when I tabled a parliamentary question in accordance with the rules of this House to ask the Taoiseach about the outcome of his meeting with credit union representatives, the Ceann Comhairle's office, in accordance with precedent and standard practice, stated that the question had been transferred to the Minister for Finance, the man who refused to meet the credit union representatives in the first instance. This issue must be viewed in the context of a Government which is unique in the history of this State. Never before has any Administration had so many resources at its disposal and never before has a Government simultaneously displayed such political incompetence in deploying those resources.</P>
    <P>At a time when morale among the Defence Forces could and should be high, it is clear from speaking to middle ranking officers, who in the past were punctilious in reserving their comments in order that they would not cross the historical divide between uniformed officers and politicians, that they have been driven to such despair that they have privately articulated their angst and concern at what is happening to the Defence Forces under the tutelage of this Government. For the first time in their lives, they cannot say they understand that the money is not available, that the Government is faced with a major budgetary crisis or that there is a problem in regard to overall taxation. The Government is systematically driving down the tax base of this country on the one hand and starving the Defence Forces of key resources on the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but in the various discussions he has had with those concerned, he has conveyed the message that it was a simple choice and he lost the battle with the Department of Finance. It was an either/or decision between a fixed number of soldiers, which was below what the Army felt was necessary to sustain its infrastructure, and the use of the spare money for extra capital. Against the background of what we have had to deal with, what our armed forces will be expected to do now that we have joined Partnership for Peace and the fact that the equipment required by the Defence Forces will be vastly in excess of previous requirements, this is a level of political incompetence from this Government which must be made known in this House.</P>
    <P>No cogent answer has been given by this Government, which is salting away 1% of our GDP into a pension fund for civil servants and others which will not be availed of for another 15 years. The Minister may have lost the political argument on a departmental basis but the Defence Forces have lost far more. The ramming through of this ham-fisted, incomplete White Paper at the eleventh hour has added insult to injury. The three Opposition parties in this House <Col N="1035" /> have tabled this motion to castigate a gross act of political incompetence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an important and timely debate and I thank everyone who has taken part. The shortcomings of the Minister's White Paper on Defence have been laid bare. The anger the process has caused among the representative organisations has been well aired. The abject failure of the Minister to produce a White Paper which charts a new direction for the Defence Forces in a rapidly changing domestic and international security environment is there for all to see. The Minister's contribution to the debate last night was defensive, detached and arrogant. He failed to recognise the crisis he precipitated in the highest ranks of the Defence Forces and to acknowledge the extensive mistrust and suspicion created by his mishandling of the White Paper process. He engaged in petty points scoring that was out of keeping with the tenor and tone of this debate and which blatantly ignored the blundering and incompetence that has marked his handling of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The incomplete version of the White Paper which the Minister launched yesterday, was used to facilitate another budget cutting exercise in our Defence Forces. Any hope that this White Paper would realistically address the role of the Defence Forces in the next decade has been long forgotten. Instead, the most senior officers in the Defence Forces have had to fight a rearguard action to invest some degree of reality in the White Paper. It is nothing short of appalling that the Chief of Staff was forced to return from East Timor in order to challenge the Minister on this White Paper. It is clear that partnership and consultation had nothing to do with the White Paper. An unprecedented crisis between the most senior officers in the Defence Forces and the Minister was only resolved due to the foresight and determination of Lieutenant General Stapleton.</P>
      <P>We should be clear about the events of the past ten days. The Minister's attitude to the White Paper critically undermined morale in the Defence Forces, denigrated the representative bodies and placed the Chief of Staff in an untenable position. The meeting on the 24 February resulted in a series of concessions that managed to contain the damage inflicted by the Minister. He signed an agreement which stated that &ldquo;the White Paper as published will be amended on the major issues above as necessary&rdquo;. The agreement succeeded in securing a range of significant and crucial changes to the White Paper as drafted. It was not a side agreement or an addendum to the document &ndash; these were actual changes to the content of the White Paper that were to be included before publication. Yet, incredibly, yesterday the Minister published a White Paper which did not refer to or include the points agreed on 24 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the Minister has ignored and dismissed the views of the Defence Forces in the <Col N="1036" /> preparation of this White Paper. That he should attempt to renege on commitments given to the Chief of Staff only six days ago is beyond belief. The evasion in which the Minister engaged at yesterday's press conference resulted in another wave of mistrust in the ranks of the Defence Forces. The Minister did nothing to allay these fears and he did not have the good grace to admit that the document he produced yesterday is at best an incomplete, partial White Paper on Defence. It was left to the Taoiseach to clarify the matter this morning and rein in the arrogance of his Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>This is appalling behaviour and it casts a serious doubt over the competence of the Minister to remain in his current post. I do not make these comments lightly.</P>
      <P>I will be clear about where I stand on the funding of the Defence Forces. There is a bogus economic rationale behind the White Paper process. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence both insist that the much needed re-equipping of the Defence Forces can only come from savings and cost cutting measures in the defence budget. It is clear this Government does not believe the Defence Forces are entitled to any share in the new resources available to it, despite the expanded and onerous tasks which the Government is imposing on the Defence Forces&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;through membership of Partnership for Peace and the new evolving common defence and security policy in the European Union. I do not accept this logic. The reality is that after years of under-investment our Defence Forces need an injection of capital for new equipment. This capital investment should come from the Exchequer. The Government has charged the Defence Forces with extended duties and it is only right and proper that the men and women who are expected to carry out these duties have the modern armaments, communications and transport necessary for them to carry out these tasks safely and professionally.</P>
      <P>The Minister has turned a deaf ear to this logic. The short-sighted, penny-pinching view of the Department of Finance has been allowed to run riot. The Minister has colluded in this bogus economic analysis. The Defence Forces needed a strong, committed Minister who could make a rational argument for increased resources. However, the Defence Forces do not have such a Minister. Not only will future investment have to be financed through job losses and land sales but the Minister, in a vindictive and grossly unfair decision, is intent on forcing the Defence Forces to cover the cost of the Army deafness hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> I will now comment on how we can progress following the turbulent and regrettable events of recent weeks. If he listened to this debate the Minister will be well aware of the anger and frustration which the White Paper process has engendered in the Defence Forces. I was pleased that my constituency colleague, Deputy Power, also noted this. It represents another serious blow to the morale of the Defence Forces, a critical problem which the Minister has failed to address since taking office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputy Wall had a reasonable IQ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to stand back from the turmoil of recent weeks and for the first time since taking office to invest real meaning in the terms consultation and partnership. He must recognise the urgent need for him to rebuild his relationship with senior officers, rank and file Defence Force members and the representative bodies.</P>
      <P>As a first step he should summon up the decency to withdraw the veiled threat he made in his speech last night to which my colleague Deputy Ferris and others referred. The Minister should also demand that the re-equipment of the Defence Forces begins immediately and does not have to wait for the proceeds of land sales or the savings from the wage bill to come on stream. The White Paper makes it clear that it may be several years until this finance becomes available from these sources. Surely after the treatment that has been meted out to the Defence Forces by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance, the Government can see the benefit in securing additional resources now, which could go on essential procurement policies. This procurement programme should not have to wait on the exchange of title deeds, or the retirement of serving members from the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also urge the Minister to urgently progress the introduction of the Defence Forces hearing <Col N="1038" /> loss compensation Bill. There is agreement that a proper statutory compensation scheme would finalise this complex issue. The Minister's exaggeration of the extent and cost of the hearing loss claims has caused much hurt in the Defence Forces, among retired and serving officers. He should finally deal with this issue and the current proposed publication date of mid-2000 should be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The White Paper process has proved to be a shambles. It has increased disillusionment and mistrust in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>It has soured relationships between the Minister and serving members of all ranks. However, in three weeks the final version of the White Paper should appear and then we must look to the future. The huge errors of judgment which the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has displayed in the drafting of the White Paper cannot be repeated. The crisis of recent weeks has been unprecedented and damaging. It is time to call a halt to the denigration and undermining of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>These men and women will be required to carry out increasingly complex and dangerous duties over the coming years. There is an onus on the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces have the resources and support necessary to carry out these tasks. That is the challenge facing the Government.</P>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to rein in the overblown arrogance the Minister has displayed in his portfolio to date. The Defence Forces and the State, cannot endure a repeat of the debacle that the Minister caused over the past number of weeks. A new start and a new approach by the Minister is urgently needed. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking in the Seanad recently, commented on the valuable arrangements on the equality agenda which, quite <Col N="1041" /> properly, put a human rights culture at the heart of the new dispensation. He said:</P>
    <P>Provision was made for issues which I could broadly describe as part of the transition from conflict to peace &ndash; the normalisation of security, reform of the policing and criminal justice systems, prisoners and the decommissioning of arms.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the implications of the Good Friday Agreement for the future incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into our body of law in the Republic and I understand the Government is actively considering its implications.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to provide further protection for human rights by the establishment of the Human Rights Commission and to define its powers and functions. The establishment of the commission is part of the ongoing process required to fulfil the terms of the agreement of the multi-party talks, more commonly know as the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement imposes on both sovereign Governments the establishment of separate human rights commissions. The words &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; are defined in section 2 as &ldquo;the rights, liberties and freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to persons by the Constitution, and the rights, liberties or freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to persons by any agreement, treaty or convention to which the State is a party&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In a general sense, the Good Friday Agreement is about human rights. It is about the right of people to sleep in their beds at night without the fear of being firebombed, the right of shoppers to walk around town centres without the risk of being blown up or the right of people to make political progress within and between communities in Northern Ireland without being subjected to the threat of violence. The parties to the Agreement affirmed their commitment to the &ldquo;mutual respect, the civil rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community&rdquo;. Among the rights they especially affirmed were the right to freedom and expression of religion, to pursue democratic national and political aspirations and of women to full and equal political participation.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement obliges the Government to create a commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to those of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. When both bodies are up and running, the Agreement envisages that they will create a joint committee &ldquo;as a forum for consideration of human rights issues in the island of Ireland&rdquo; and especially to consider &ldquo;the possibility of establishing a charter open to signature by all democratic parties reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everyone living in the island of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The most immediate function of the commission is determined by section 8. This is inclusive of the general provisions of keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the law <Col N="1042" /> and practice in the State relating to human rights and to make recommendations to the Government which are considered necessary to strengthen, protect and uphold those rights. It must also promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights and it may undertake research and educational activities, sponsor a commission to do so or provide financial or other assistance for that purpose.</P>
    <P>A commission may conduct an inquiry either of its own volition or at the request of any person who considers that an inquiry is necessary or expedient. Any inquiry may be refused if the commission is of the opinion that the matter could be more appropriately dealt with by the institution of legal proceedings or by the taking of an application to a tribunal or other person in whom are vested powers to award, redress or grant appropriate relief. Proceedings may be discontinued where it is considered the request is trivial or vexatious or the alleged violation is manifestly unfounded. An inquiry may be held in public or in private.</P>
    <P>Information obtained by the commission in the course of its functions and which has not otherwise come to the notice of the public shall not be disclosed to members of the public unless authorised by the commission. A person who fails to comply with the request or make disclosure to the commission shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>
    <P>Both the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Commission in the Republic are required to advise and make recommendations to their respective Executives on the adequacy and effectiveness of the law relating to the protection of human rights. Each is entitled to conduct inquiries but only the Irish commission has power to compel disclosure of documents and the attendance of witnesses. The immediate priorities of the respective commissions may be formed from different perspectives. The inhumanity of sectarian violence is the most obvious concern of the Northern Ireland commission. The issues for the Irish commission are not so immediately obvious, but some matters demand attention, including the rights of minorities, refugees, racism issues, Travellers, etc.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Northern Ireland commission, once the nine part-time commissioners have been appointed, the commission as a whole will have to plan a strategy for the immediate future. Where the priorities will lie remains to be seen. It will want to maintain a high profile for its work and to develop a reputation for thoroughness, accuracy and a commitment to internationally recognised standards. It will be able, if it wishes, to express its views on punishment beatings and shootings, which to most people are the most salient issues which need to be addressed, especially in Northern Ireland. It will also need to learn from the experience of human rights commissions in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> It is a significant milestone in the area of human rights that this is being addressed by the Government and the Executive in Northern Ireland. I am not certain, with the suspension of the Executive, exactly what is the position of the commission in Northern Ireland. Undoubtedly there is a need for parity of esteem and equality. These are issues concerning fundamental human rights which ought to inform the commissions in Northern Ireland and the Republic. I welcome the discussion by the Government about the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into our body of law. I am glad to have had the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for sharing his time with me. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which had the majority support of both communities on this island, it was agreed that a human rights commission would be set up in the Republic of Ireland. This is why we are putting in place such a commission under the Bill. Before looking in detail at the provisions of the Bill, I wish to make some remarks about the state of the peace process at present.</P>
      <P>I am as disappointed as anyone else at the developments in Northern Ireland in recent weeks, especially by the suspension of the Executive. It is important we put in context the developments of recent weeks. Ever since 1994, there has been relative peace in Northern Ireland. There was the horrendous bombing in Omagh which claimed nearly 30 lives. However painful and sickening those events were for the friends and families of the bereaved, the past five and a half years have seen some real signs towards reconciliation between the two communities. The Good Friday Agreement lays the framework for how an everlasting peace agreement which commands the widespread majority support of both communities can be achieved. I do not believe the Good Friday Agreement will be shelved. It has some tangible and innovative proposals which can help foster economic and social progress in Northern Ireland as well as build a greater trust between Unionists, Nationalists and republicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Respect for human rights must be a central part of any civil society. No democracy can succeed unless the human rights of citizens who live in that state are respected. That is partly the function of the Bill. Under the terms of the agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations in Northern Ireland, it was agreed to establish a human rights commission in the Republic of Ireland with a mandate and remit equivalent to that in Northern Ireland. The proposals in the Bill also take account of the work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the Constitutional Review Group's 1996 report which recommended that a human rights commission should be established in the State. The objective of such a commission is to maintain an overview of the extent to which human rights are protected at both constitutional <Col N="1044" /> and legal level, to assess the adequacy of this protection and to make recommendations to the Government for the better protection of these rights as appropriate. The Bill also reflects and accommodates where possible the views put forward by various interested organisations which were consulted, in particular, the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill draws on the universally accepted benchmark or blueprint for national human rights institutions adopted by the 1991 International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and by the UN General Assembly in December 1993 and which has come to be known as the Paris Principles. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1998, the Taoiseach stated that a national institution would be established to meet the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement which would be a model of its kind for Europe.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states that the Human Rights Commission will be charged with the responsibility of examining law and practice in this day with reference not only to human rights and fundamental freedom contained in the Constitution, but also by reference to those instruments which reflect modern human rights norms. These include the European Convention on Human Rights to which Ireland is a signatory, the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. As other conventions and agreements are ratified by the State, they too will come within the remit of the Human Rights Commission. Examples in this regard include the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention Against Torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment which are under active consideration in this respect. As the 1996 report of the Constitutional Review Group illustrates, the list of human rights treaties to which the State is a party is quite extensive.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the independence of the Human Rights Commission. It is generally recognised, and correctly so, that an effective human rights commission will be one capable of acting independently of Governments. The commission will, however, have to conform with the accepted norms and practices with regard to financial matters such as auditing, accounting and relating procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the proposed membership of the commission. Subsection (1) provides that the commission will have a president and eight other members. Subsection (2) provides that all such members will be appointed by Government <Col N="1045" /> and subsection (3) is designed to ensure that those members will be drawn from the widest possible background so as to ensure pluralist representation of the social elements involved in the promotion and protection of human rights in this State. The term of office for the members of the commission will be five years.</P>
    <P>Section 8 contains one of the core provisions. It sets out in detail the functions of the Human Rights Commission which are to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in this state relating to the protection of human rights; to consult with national and international human rights bodies as it sees fit; to make recommendations to Government on measures to strengthen and protect and uphold human rights in the State; to conduct inquiries as it considers necessary or expedient; to prepare and publish reports and research or inquiries conducted by it; to establish and participate in the North-South Committee of Representatives drawn from the commissions in both jurisdictions as required under paragraph 10 of the relevant section of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the proposed inquiries by the Human Rights Commission. In brief, this section enables the commission to undertake inquiries into any matter it considers relevant. It will have a completely free hand in this respect and may decide to conduct its inquiries in public or in private as it sees fit. This section, most importantly, provides the commission with the means to conduct its inquiries. It can require the production of relevant information or documents with the necessary powers to obtain an order from the Circuit Court accordingly with penalties for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>Section 10 refers to prospective and possible legal advice sought by the Human Rights Commission. It provides that a person may apply to the commission for legal advice, legal representation or such other assistance as the commission deems appropriate in the circumstances relating to the protection of human rights. While the European Convention on Human Rights was signed and ratified by Ireland in the early 1950s, it has not been incorporated into Irish law. That matter is currently under review arising from the obligation of the Good Friday Agreement to further examine the matter in the context of strengthening and underpinning the constitutional protection of human rights in the State. In the event that provisions of the conventions are given effect in Irish law, its provisions will then come within the scope of this section.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections 12 to 26 refer to the duties of the chief executive officer and staff; the need to put forward appropriate audits and accounts as well as dealing with remunerative aspects for staff members. I agree with section 23 which obliges the commission to produce and submit an annual report on its activities in the preceding year not later than 31 March. The Minister should ensure that copies of the report are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> Section 24 provides that the commission shall make a report to the Government after a period of two years in operation containing such recommendations as it thinks fit for the improvement of its effectiveness and the effectiveness of any functions conferred on it by the Bill. The commission is to pay particular regard to any developments in the field of human rights that have occurred in the period not just within the State but internationally.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission will be successful if appropriately funded. I know it is the Government's intention to ensure that adequate and substantial funds are made available to guarantee that it is administered effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill establishing a Human Rights Commission. This is extremely important legislation which, along with the equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill, will form a key element in protecting human rights in this country.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise three points with the Minister, the first of which relates to the importance of a public information and education campaign on human rights. We have had a less than satisfactory approach over the years to the incorporation of international treaties protecting human rights. The level of debate on human rights in general has not been very high. I hope the Minister will ensure that suitable information on the various aspects of this Bill will be made available. I wish to quote from the address made by Mrs. Robinson to a conference on African human rights institutions in South Africa. She stated:</P>
      <P>Again for those of you about to establish national institutions let me underline the importance not only of the mandate and the legislative mechanism for creating a human rights commission but also the process of public consultation and transparency which should precede its creation. A national institution established hastily without public understanding of its role and responsibilities will be unlikely to succeed in its mission.</P>
      <P>That is a very important point and is one which we should take note of. Many good submissions were received during the development of this Bill from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty and many other NGOs during the hearings held by the justice committee. The Bill has been greatly improved by the suggestions made at those hearings which were very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to the importance of the appointment of the chair of the commission. The Minister should appoint to this position someone who has a record of protecting human rights, who has a record in understanding equality <Col N="1047" /> issues and who will have the imagination to make of the Human Rights Commission the powerful instrument it could be. I hope when the time comes the Minister will make a strong appointment to that position.</P>
    <P>The Paris Principles have already been referred to. The principles, endorsed by the Commission on Human Rights in 1992 stressed that national institutions should be established by legislation or constitutional provision but should be fully independent of Government, pluralist and representative of the social forces of civil society. I hope the Minister will take this into account as the Human Rights Commission is established.</P>
    <P>My third point relates to the up-to-date position in regard to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. It is extraordinary that we are the only country which has not managed to do that. What is different about our approach to this issue and about Irish law that we have been unable to do what every other contracting country has done?</P>
    <P>This week we heard that the Equality Authority has received 3,000 queries since it was established. That reflects a growing need in the area of equality and human rights. It also shows that information about the Equality Authority is getting into the public arena, which is important. A human rights commission will complement and continue the work of the Equality Authority.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> earlier this week stated that the Refugee Council is concerned at the dispersal of under age asylum seekers. It shocked many people because it described the fact that asylum seekers throughout the State have no access to legal advice or other essential services. It confirmed that there are now 87 minors seeking asylum in the State, two of whom are aged 12, three aged 14, eight aged 15, 27 aged 16 and the remainder aged 17. Questions were raised as to whether they were informed of their rights on arrival, such as the right to legal advice. The Refugee Council believes there is not sufficient information or services available to these minors, some of whom were on their own. One pregnant girl was sent to Ennis shortly after her arrival but she was not given the opportunity to see a doctor. That scenario is disturbing.</P>
    <P>Providing adequate protection for refugees and asylum seekers and proper access to education, housing and basic services will be a key issue for us in the future. Given that this is a new and challenging area for society, there will be problems. The human rights commission and the Equality Authority will have strong roles to play in protecting the rights of minority groups here.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been introduced as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, which states that the Irish Government will establish a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland, and international pressure from the United Nations to establish national institutions to protect individual human rights. This international trend was evident at the <Col N="1048" /> Beijing women's conference in 1995 and at the Vienna world conference on human rights in 1993. Both these conferences called on all states to establish such commissions. Mrs. Mary Robinson has also played a part in this international movement in her efforts to advance human rights.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the powers human rights commissions should have. The Paris Principles set minimum standards but they stress the need for complete independence of Governments and the power to human rights proof existing and proposed legislation. Recently we discussed legislation relating to deportation and concerns were expressed about human rights.</P>
    <P>The Paris Principles also state that there should be the power to investigate possible abuses or patterns of abuse of human rights. The Government has established a commission to inquire into widespread child abuse. However, if an outside body had had the opportunity to examine the pattern of child abuse at the time, it could have been stopped. The principles state there should be the power to subpoena witnesses and documents in order to carry out such investigations. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the range of areas the human rights commission could examine. This would help to inform the public of the potential of the new commission which will be established under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Ireland will set up a human rights commission, which is overdue. We have been tardy in recognising human rights. In the area of women's rights, we have been driven by international legislation and conventions rather than by Government initiatives. There is unfinished work in the area of women's rights and new issues are emerging which will have implications for human rights. They include domestic violence, sexual assault and trafficking in women, which all European Governments must address. Some work was done at European level recently on trafficking in women and this has implications for Irish law.</P>
    <P>New challenges arise all the time but establishing the human rights commission will mean that grievances and injustice can be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that we are only now discussing the establishment of a human rights commission. However, that is not to say we do not have many other mechanisms whereby people can seek redress if they feel their human rights have been abused. If we did not have the Good Friday Agreement, would this legislation have been introduced? Perhaps it is a failure of successive Governments that we did not establish a human rights commission on our own initiative. Nevertheless, I am glad we are doing so now. It is interesting that the UK has already established its commission. The Good Friday Agreement highlighted the need for us to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the areas of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity were being discussed in preparation for the Good Friday Agreement in 1996 and 1997, it was amazing how many times <Col N="1049" /> the issue of changing people's attitudes and mindsets and revolutionising the way in which society had developed in Northern Ireland because of the unnatural way people had become ghettoised was raised. Housing was given out to Nationalists on one side and to Unionists on the other side and this helped to perpetuate the breakdown of normal society. It was only when one considered what needed to be included under a heading, such as human rights, in the Good Friday Agreement that one realised how society in Northern Ireland was not normal. It also meant that the Irish Government, the Civil Service and the Ministers negotiating the Good Friday Agreement were challenged to listen to their consciences and to ask if they had adequate legislation in their jurisdiction to deal with this matter, but they discovered that they did not.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the concept of human rights commissions is relatively new. It is interesting to consider some of the countries which already have such commissions. I am not filled with a huge amount of confidence by the fact that Indonesia has a human rights commission. One begins to wonder about the usefulness of such a commission. The fact that the Philippines has a human rights commission also fails to fill me with confidence. I accept that Mr. Marcos and his followers are no longer in power in the Philippines but, having visited the islands, it does not appear that the commission is doing a great deal for the poor people who live there. The human rights commission in Indonesia is of no use whatsoever, particularly when one considers what that country did to the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure that people will have full and complete confidence in the human rights commission which will be established here. That commission must do its work in a way which inspires people to adhere to the judgments and advice it gives.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the function of the Northern Ireland commission is to keep under review the adequacy of law and practice relating to human rights in that jurisdiction. The members of the commission will act as advisers to the Assembly as it considers legislation. In other words, they will be responsible for benchmarking all items of legislation.</P>
    <P>Every item of legislation passed by this House involves some aspect of human or civil rights. Therefore, there is nothing which does not have to be closely examined. A year or two before I entered Government in 1994, a new mechanism was introduced which obliged each Department to include in every memorandum to Government a heading which listed the effects of legislation on women. In other words, the legislation had to be gender proofed. In some instances it was stated that an item of legislation had no particular effect on men or women. However, every Department was obliged to include such information on each memorandum to Government. Without giving away any Cabinet secrets, such information often <Col N="1050" /> led to a great deal of discussion because a Minister may have written below the heading that the legislation would have no particular effect.</P>
    <P>There are indirect discriminations in many of our practices in this State. Let me provide an example. An indirect discrimination exists in respect of a person's right to participate in a community employment scheme. In order to be able to take up a place on a community employment scheme, a person must have been signing on for 12 months. Women who have given up their jobs to work in the home and who want to return to the workforce because their children have started school believe that the best way to do so is by taking up a place on a community employment scheme where they will work for 20 hours per week and still have time to spend with their children when they come home from school. Those women are discriminated against by the mere fact that they have not been signing on and there is no mechanism which will allow them to qualify if they have been absent from the workforce. That is an indirect discrimination mainly against women because, by and large, it is they who give up their employment to work full time in the home.</P>
    <P>I hope the commission, when established, will be able to proof the State's systems. Let us consider the issues that led to an onus being placed on the Irish and British Governments to establish human rights commissions. The relevant documentation informs us that against the background of the recent history of communal conflict, the parties affirmed, in particular, the right to free political thought, the right to freedom and expression of religion, the right to pursue democratically national and political aspirations, the right to seek constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate means, the right to freely choose one's place of residence, the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity, the right to freedom form sectarian harassment and the right of women to full and equal political participation. It is a sad reflection that in 1998, almost 50 years after the UN Declaration on Human Rights, there was a need to list these rights and freedoms in legislation to establish a human rights commission. These rights and freedoms should be automatic.</P>
    <P>When the commission is established, I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day will not be able to persist in leaving in place systems which allow, as Deputy Fitzgerald stated, young asylum seekers to be treated in the way they are being treated at present. Such treatment is not excusable but at times it is understandable because the staff of health boards, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other institutions are dealing with this area for the first time.</P>
    <P>I have heard some horrific stories about asylum seekers who are being sent to bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin suburbs with only 50p in their pockets. They are supposed to travel <Col N="1051" /> to that accommodation by bus and return to the Mount Street centre the next morning in order to queue all day. Nobody cares whether these people have the means to travel to their accommodation which is sometimes situated in Portmarnock, Malahide and Swords. Great concern has been expressed about the welfare of 17 to 19 year old women who are obliged to travel to the suburbs at night and then return to Mount Street the next morning to spend the day in the hope that they will be dealt with before the end of the day's business.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal more to do in terms of the delivery of human and civil rights in this country, not just for ourselves but for those who come here seeking asylum or work. It is time that a human rights commission was established because we do not yet recognise the multicultural nature of our society. I looked up into the visitors' gallery this morning and spotted a group of school children, three of whom were from a country in Africa. Ten years ago one would not have seen someone in the gallery that one could instantly recognise as being from Africa. The people of Ireland must face up to the reality of respecting the human and civil rights of others.</P>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of the Human Rights Commission Bill. I reiterate Deputy Fitzgerald's comment that the appointment of the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission will be crucial. I urge the Minister to reflect long and hard on the type of person he appoints to that position because it will be on the basis of the respect paid to that person that the commission will succeed or fail.</P>

        <b>:</b> This evening the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will close the Second Stage debate of the Human Rights Commission Bill, a measure designed to establish a Human Rights Commission to promote and protect human rights and to develop a human rights ethos in this country. Next week, at a select committee of this House, this same Minister will make a total mockery of the aspirations contained in this Bill by crudely bludgeoning through Committee Stage amendments to the Illegal Trafficking in Immigrants Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>These amendments are blatantly discriminatory in that they establish a separate and much less favourable regime of judicial treatment for asylum seekers and non-nationals than that to which Irish nationals are entitled. Next week at the select committee the Minister will reduce the time within which an asylum seeker must seek leave to apply for a judicial review in order to challenge the refusal of his asylum application from three months to 14 days or, in essence, ten working days. That is, by any standards, a very wrong and unfair measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill to the House on 25 November 1999, he talked about our Human Rights Commission being a model of best practice for others. Yet, while the Bill is weaving <Col N="1052" /> its way through the Dáil, the same Minister seeks to introduce a parallel blatantly discriminatory measure which sets at nought the whole principle of the equal application of the law. He chooses to deliberately ignore Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution and the interpretation of these Articles which clarifies in explicit terms the broadening of the scope of the Constitution for the protection of non-citizens as well as citizens. What the Minister is doing is unconstitutional and should be referred to the Council of State.</P>

      <P>The Government stands accused of failing to introduce a proper immigration policy in order to make a clear distinction between asylum seekers and economic immigrants.

      <Col N="1053" /> An Irish citizen will continue to have three months to apply for a judicial review. An asylum seeker will have 14 days. Apart from the anti-asylum seeker discrimination in the new measure, the Minister's amendment goes on to state that such leave shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied there are substantial grounds. In other words, in order to get permission for a judicial review, the applicant must present a watertight case. How can any asylum seeker and his legal team possibly prepare the required watertight case within two weeks?</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I will get to it in my own time but I will finish my contribution on this amendment first. This amendment is deeply offensive to the fundamental rights of people and to Parliament. This is not the first time this Minister has introduced substantial amendments on Committee Stage which effectively change the goalposts and the content of a Bill, when the Second Stage of this Bill has not been completed. By introducing these amendments on Committee Stage, he has subverted, aborted and precluded the right of this House to debate substantial amendments.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time this has happened. It happened with the Immigration Bill, when the entire thrust and substance of the Bill was changed on Committee Stage without reference back to the House. It also happened in relation to the Broadcasting Bill. It is a ploy and a mechanism adopted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If legal advice were got on this subverting of due process, the Government would face serious questions about the manner in which it seeks to undermine the fundamental right of this House to a proper debate. Standing Orders set down that there are five Stages to a debate. The First Stage is publication, Second Stage is the broad debate on the principles of the Bill, Third Stage is a minute dissection and analysis of the Bill, Fourth or Report Stage is where the Bill is brought back into the House and is followed by Fifth Stage. Introducing huge tranches of amendments on Committee Stage subverts and undermines the fundamental rights of this House. It is deeply offensive and contemptuous of Parlia<Col N="1055" /> ment. This is not the first time the Minister has treated this House in such a derisory fashion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Human Rights Commission Bill. I am entitled to make those points because they are relevant to the Bill and what will happen in the select committee next week. As I said before, it is a fundamental part of our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. I welcome the consultation process that preceded publication of the Bill, where members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights had an opportunity to meet with representatives of non-governmental organisations to listen to their views and concerns. It is a much better Bill as a result of this consultation. It is obvious from an examination of the Bill as published and from the Minister's Second Stage speech that the views of the various non-governmental organisations have been heard and taken on board. For example, the commission's maximum right to membership, of a president plus eight members, is being opted for. The Minister also clarified that it is envisaged in sections 8 and 9 that the commission may conduct inquiries. However, will he clarify whether the commission can conduct a public sworn inquiry? It has already been stated that the commission can hold inquiries in public but can it hold sworn public inquiries? Will the Minister also clarify whether the commission can conduct such inquiries outside the State?</P>
    <P>I regret there is no provision in the Bill to enable the commission to draft legislation or to scrutinise draft legislation. One would imagine that an independent statutory body, the membership of which is drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds, would be entitled to suggest legislative changes and to suggest the draft form that such changes would take, as well as carrying out a constructive analysis of draft legislative proposals from Government.</P>
    <P>Like others, I detect a clear preference on the part of the Minister for the appointment of a serving or former judge to the position of president of the commission. I am not <i>au fait</i> with the specialist qualifications or interests of serving or retired judges, but rather than assuming it must be a judge or a former judge, the Minister should take serious note of the fact that the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland is functioning well under its chief commissioner Professor Brice Dickson, former professor of law at the University of Ulster. It is crucial for the success of the commission that its president has a broad range of experience in the area of human rights and what might loosely be described as a feel for the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I will address Ireland's performance in the area of fundamental human rights and the performance of this Government in particular. Apart from the contradictory position of the Minister, we are extremely exposed in terms of our performance on other human rights fronts. In 1950, the Council of Europe drew up the European Convention on Human Rights which became the <Col N="1056" /> touchstone charter for drafting international human rights law. Ireland was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the convention. However, 50 years later, not only have we failed to incorporate the convention into domestic law but of the 41 contracting countries of the Council of Europe we are the only one not to have done so. We signed and ratified the convention, yet the rights and safeguards of the convention cannot be pleaded before our domestic courts. As a result, Irish citizens are left in the ludicrous and expensive situation that they must first exhaust every legal domestic redress, where the charter is not of any relevance, before taking their case to Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>As a nation how can we face into any international forum and claim a right to participate in a debate on human rights when we are so patently found out by our unwillingness to draft a Bill to give domestic validity to the measures we applauded and ratified so enthusiastically 50 long years ago? This from a country which lobbied successfully for the appointment of Mary Robinson to the post of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland is still performing very poorly in dealing with Traveller issues. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has set down statutory minimum targets and guidelines for local authorities yet much local authority time is spent trying to diffuse the NIMBY factor which tends to prevail as councillors invariably come under pressure from local settled communities protesting at halting sites or traveller housing. Last evening's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and this morning's newspaper headlines amply illustrate that some things never change, that the anti-traveller prejudice is rampant and it will take a major effort to break it down.</P>
    <P>An area in which the Government can really effect change and show the way to the private sector is in dealing with the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of minorities and the area of gender balance. I am not convinced by recent statements by the Taoiseach and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wringing their hands in helpless acknowledgement that, throughout the public service, we have failed to meet the modest goals set down by the Government. The Minister acknowledged that 51% of State-sponsored bodies do not have guidelines for dealing with sexual harassment and almost half do not have a policy on equal opportunities. Of the 82 State-sponsored bodies surveyed, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta came closest to reaching the standard, but both had a compliance rate of only 79%. The reality is that there has been only marginal progress towards realising the targets set down. How can any Government expect others to fulfil their duties and obligations when the Government and its State agencies with the vast resources at their disposal and endless opportunities to lead the way have faltered so badly? This failure points to a glaring misjudgment in the construction of this Government. It was a major <Col N="1057" /> error not to continue with the Department of Equality and Law Reform as a separate entity. The first and only Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, was totally absorbed by his brief and with the welfare of the disadvantaged, the discriminated against and minorities. Nominations for appointment to every official body were checked, cross-checked and gender checked and nominations were vetoed unless the established quotas were met. It was inevitable, given the huge expanse of the justice brief, that once equality was merged with it, the latter would soon become the Cinderella once again. This is a sad fact because there is so much to do.</P>
    <P>There are glaring examples in areas for which the Government is responsible, of where people's fundamental rights are not being respected. For example, the elderly, whose fundamental right is to spend their twilight years in the secure comfort of the homes which, in many cases, they built, are being flouted and disregarded. What greater right have we than the right to live and the right to life? However, there are health service waiting lists of up to two years for cardiac surgery where some people never receive treatment as they die before their turn arrives. Are these people on the second rung of a two-tier health service?</P>
    <P>There are also the educational rights of mentally handicapped children. The Constitution aspires to cherish all our children equally yet voluntary and parent groups have to constantly sell tickets, collect money at church gates and organise fund-raising events to supplement the shortfall in the level and quality of services. The list is endless. I welcome the commission. This is step in the right direction which is long overdue and I suspect it will have a busy time.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to Second Stage. It is fair to say there was a broad welcome for the Bill about which I am genuinely pleased. Some of the points raised deserve further comment, even those which were more ludicrous.</P>
      <P>The position as regards our ratification of the Council of Europe framework convention on national minorities was mentioned. This convention is referred to in the relevant section of the Good Friday Agreement and, as I stated when introducing the Bill on 25 November 1999, in accordance with the requirement in the Agreement the convention was ratified on 1 May 1999. The House passed the Bill which will allow us to ratify the UN Convention against Torture and the necessary action will be taken as soon as the Bill passed by the Seanad on 7 July 1999 is approved by the Dáil and enacted into law.</P>
      <P>When the Equal Status Bill is enacted, steps will be taken to ratify the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination and the question of lifting certain reservations applicable to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women will be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> Following the coming into effect of the revised Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution on 2 December 1999, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill was published and is awaiting Second Stage. The provisions of the Bill are designed to take effect from that date. It goes without saying that the Bill could not have been brought forward in advance of the review of the Good Friday Agreement because the technical approach to the Bill's naturalisation provisions may have been different depending on whether the constitutional changes were to be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan asked if there were consultations on the Bill with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. That process started with a letter from the High Commissioner to the Taoiseach on 15 June 1998. A meeting with senior officials followed in September of that year with the UN High Commissioner's Special Adviser on National Human Rights Institutions. Further meetings and discussions on the Government's proposals took place on three further occasions in the first half of 1999. Given the development of human rights commissions in Australia and New Zealand, the opportunity was taken to consult with senior members of those commissions who were visiting Ireland at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputies Howlin and Ó Caoláin were critical of the apparent delay in producing the Bill. I do not accept that there was an undue delay. The outline of the general scheme was settled in November 1998 at the time the Labour Party published its Private Members' Bill. The Government then approved the unusual step of publishing the scheme for consideration, a move which has been warmly welcomed by this House. That process took some time as &ndash; many of the NGOs which contributed to the discussions will testify to this &ndash; my Department had an open door policy about meeting any person or group interested in the proposals. Furthermore, account had to be taken of the fact that two committees of this House were also considering these proposals. The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution made its views known to me in March 1999 and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights reported on 17 June 1999. The Bill was then published in early July 1999.</P>
    <P>In so far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned, I do not agree with the view that has been expressed that the Government somehow favours or is predisposed toward the appointment of a judge as president of the commission. The scheme was amended in this respect and the Government is now empowered to consider a candidate from any walk of life for the position. If it happens that a judge is considered for the appointment, certain technical legal consequences flow from that. The inclusion of those provisions in the Bill, however, are merely facilitatory in that context. They are certainly not indicative of the Government's thinking on the issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the belated question of membership of the commission, I have said that the <Col N="1059" /> Government will be as open and transparent as possible in making these appointments. I do not see the need for an elaborate appointment procedure, either through a selection committee, as was done in the case of the Dublin Docklands Development Board Act, or a Dáil-Seanad ratification process, as happens with the Ombudsman, a procedure we also considered. As I said in my speech, the commission in Northern Ireland was appointed using the formal procedures which apply in that jurisdiction requiring open competition for such posts. The Government could decide to adopt a similar process or it could decide to consult as widely as possible with interested groups and seek nominations prior to appointing members. We will certainly take into account the views of this House in the matter in our determination to have the membership of the commission drawn from as wide a base as possible of suitable candidates with human rights expertise, knowledge or experience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the commission having a specific power to draft legislation. I see no difficulty with that. The commission, under section 8(f2&gt;c), will be entitled to frame its proposals to Government in whatever form it chooses. If it decides to follow the Law Reform Commission and draft its proposals in suitable format, that would be very beneficial in the drafting process which is ultimately the responsibility of the parliamentary draftsman's office.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flanagan and Howlin queried the exclusion of parliamentarians from membership of the commission. I am happy enough to look at that between now and Committee Stage and I have a certain sympathy for their point of view. I am disposed towards amending the Bill in that respect.</P>
    <P>I will also consider the suggestion that the commission should have the power to issue public statements in relation to the human rights aspect of situations where groups of people might be discriminated against. A provision could be modelled on section 5(1) of the 1994 New Zealand human rights Act. We looked at this in the earlier stages but we thought that such a function would be embraced by section 8(f2&gt;c) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the undertaking of an audit of human rights aspects of all our laws and regulations is embraced by the function of the commission in section 8(f2&gt;a). I readily admit, however, that it lacks a timeframe within which the work should be done. We must be careful not to overburden the commission, especially during its initial period of operation. Deputy Flanagan should be aware that when the New Zealand commission was given a remit with a four year time limit in the 1994 Act, it had been up and running since 1977. I would prefer to leave things as they are at the moment so the commission can determine its priorities in the light of what it sees as areas where it needs to get involved straight away.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned Sweden's incorporation into law of the Convention on Human <Col N="1060" /> Rights. The Swedish statute entered into force on 1 January 1995. It provides that the convention is to have the status of ordinary law. Given that this law could come into conflict with other legislation, it was necessary to add to the Swedish Constitution a provision that a law or other regulation should not be issued in conflict with Sweden's obligations under the convention. This solution is still regarded as controversial because it seems to open the way for judicial encroachment on the freedom of Parliament to enact laws. It does not represent a model which we should follow.</P>
    <P>I hope to bring to the attention of the Government very soon my proposals on the question of incorporation as required by the Good Friday Agreement. When they have been considered a decision will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>
    <P>In case my silence is taken as assent, I utterly reject statements and imputations cast by the two main Opposition spokesmen during the otherwise very constructive and worthwhile contributions to this debate on 25 November. The general thrust of the comments was to the effect that the climate in my Department does not allow for priority and detailed consideration of important international conventions and that this is indicative of the mindset of those charged with that area of policy. It was inferred that the decision to amalgamate the Department of Justice with the Department of Equality and Law Reform is partly to blame for the deprioritisation of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; legislation, that I might be less diligent than my relevant predecessor in my vindication of equality issues at Cabinet level and that the draft legislation now before the House would have been better left to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>These are disgraceful comments to which the staff of the Department and I take grave exception. I had occasion recently to nail similar statements in the Seanad and what I said there deserves repetition in this House. One of the truly great repositories of human rights in the State since its foundation has been the Department of Justice in its various guises. My record and that of the Department in terms of legislation is testament to that. Since entering office I have steered an unprecedented 25 Bills through the Oireachtas and I have 13 more before it at the moment. A substantial number of these Bills could be called &ldquo;soft legislation&rdquo;. The record of the Department goes back further than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked this evening about the areas of competence of the commission. We do not intend for there to be any no-go areas. Obviously, if a matter is properly the concern of another statutory agency, such as the Equality Agency, matters should be left to that body. The commission could still have a role in relation to systemic or procedural aspects, even where a statutory body has competence. As to inquiries of the commission, it will have a free hand in the question of whether such inquiries are prudent, private, public or sworn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> I doubt the issue of the commission travelling abroad will arise. There may be restraints arising from the law of the country concerned. If the issue arises, the matter can be considered during the two year review of the commission's work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the commission should have the power to better scrutinise draft legislation, that is already the intention behind section 8, paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>), setting out the commission's functions. The term &ldquo;draft legislation&rdquo; strictly speaking, means proposals that are published in Bill form. It is open to the commission to make whatever suggestions it considers appropriate in that connection. However, the term also embraces draft heads or schemes of Bills. It is desirable that the commission should also have a role in this regard because its input at the preparatory stage would be useful and valuable. We must be careful this function does not conflict with the role of the Government's constitutional and legal adviser in all matters, including on the question of compatibility of draft proposals with modern human rights norms as set out in the various conventions, treaties and agreements to which the State is, or maybe about to become a party. The wording of the Bill seeks to achieve the fullest possible constitutional advisory role of the commission in this respect.</P>
    <P>Those who commented in the House on the issue of asylum seekers and who were members of the previous Administration have considerable audacity. They seek to lecture me in this House on the asylum process when they should hang their heads in shame following upon their maladministration when in office. The total chaos which was left behind by that Administration, when thousands of applicants not alone did not know if or when their claims would be heard, but were led to the view that they could be waiting <i>ad secula seculorum</i> is a testament to that. At the time there was no provision for legal aid, for a one stop shop such as we have now, for health screening, or for translation facilities. There were 22 staff working in my Department on a part-time basis on thousands of cases. Is that the record of an Administration that had even the remotest interest in asylum seekers? It is the record of a Government that had decided to ignore the issue to see if it would go away. Given that context, it is very difficult for me to accept the crocodile tears which are falling here this evening. The comments made are those of people who did nothing about the issue when in office.</P>
    <P>I have heard and noted all the comments made this evening. I noted what Deputy Fitzgerald said on the issue of the dispersal of minors and what Deputy Owen said regarding what she heard about people being sent off with 50p in their pockets. I also noted what both Deputies said about rumours they had heard to the effect that minors were being dispersed and not getting legal advice. I too read of these anonymous cases. I am the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and if people have a case which they <Col N="1062" /> want to put before me with names and addresses and times and dates I ask them to do so and I assure all Members of the House that I will investigate them. However, the reality is that Deputies are making wild allegations in the House on foot of hearsay and are not producing any evidence to back them up. That is desperately unfair to the people who are processing these claims in the most humane manner possible.</P>
    <P>It may be the case that people do not agree with the policy and that there are people in the House and outside who believe in an open door policy. It may also be the case that they want me to preside over a situation where all asylum seekers coming into the country be allowed to work. They are entitled to make that case, but I ask people inside and outside the House to hold an honest debate on the issue. Do not repeat allegations which cannot be substantiated. I ask people everywhere to have a calm, cool and rational debate without exaggeration and misrepresentation and without misleading the public to achieve an objective. Let us leave the ulterior motives elsewhere and hold a realistic debate. It might also do no harm to leave behind the juvenile name calling.</P>
    <P>What is occurring among certain sections inside and outside the House is a dishonest debate, predicated not on facts but on fantasy and nothing else. That is not viable. It is a dishonest and disingenuous position for people to hold. I again plead with them to come up front, state the facts, present the evidence and stand over it. If people cannot put up, they might as well shut up.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of unaccompanied asylum seekers and minors, when unaccompanied minors make an application for asylum they are immediately referred to the relevant health board. That is the truth. The responsibility of the health board for an unaccompanied minor is exactly the same as that for an Irish child under the Child Care Acts. All asylum seekers receive information in a language they understand and all are entitled to legal advice at all stages of the asylum process. In those circumstances would the Deputies who made allegations in the House earlier tonight and those outside the House who make similar allegations in the media, present their evidence or stop spreading untruths.</P>
    <P>In the course of a scandalous contribution in the House tonight, which betrayed an abject lack of knowledge of the subject, Deputy Jim Higgins tried to suggest that the measure now being proposed by the Government in relation to judicial review is &ldquo;a racist measure&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>He went on to say the distinction was not being made between an asylum seeker and an illegal or economic immigrant. That betrays an ignorance of this subject that is beyond comprehension. An asylum seeker can be an illegal immigrant or an economic migrant and he is either one of those or a refugee. The <Col N="1063" /> term &ldquo;asylum seeker&rdquo; is, therefore, an all encompassing phrase for &ldquo;illegal immigrant&rdquo; and &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The difference between an asylum seeker and the other two is that the status has not been determined. If Deputy Jim Higgins does not understand the basic terminology which applies under the law in relation to asylum and refugees, then the deductions he subsequently makes could not possibly be right. At the very least is casts a very serious doubt on either his willingness to be forthcoming or his understanding of what he is talking about.</P>

      <P>Regarding judicial review and the proposed reduction in time from three months to 14 days, Deputy Higgins seeks to give the impression that somebody is being asked to prepare a case <i>de novo</i> in a period of 14 days. That, Sir, is untrue. Every asylum seeker must make an application in the first instance which is then considered by the officials. Every asylum seeker who is deemed to be an illegal immigrant has the opportunity of appealing to a refugee appeals commissioner. That means the case is dealt with all over again. At that point is it not fair to assume that if the individual has been turned down&mdash;</P>

There is nothing wrong with that and that is all we are asking them to do.</P>
      <P>Of course the misrepresentation, the misleading, the nudge and wink and the ulterior motive has taken over in parts of the House and in some places outside it. That, while it may never be printed, is the truth. John Keats once wrote</P>

      <P>When Mr. Finlay says this is bad law, he expresses his opinion as he is entitled to do. At no point would I attempt to muzzle an individual who wishes to express an opinion in relation to any issue, something which is well known. Would that some of my critics were as liberal as I in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General advises the Government. I did not get up one morning and decide I could introduce this measure and that it would be constitutional. I take the advice of the Attorney General. It is a matter for Mr. Finlay if his advice differs from that of the Attorney General. I am not obliged to take and it is questionable whether I can take the advice of Mr. Finlay. I suggest that my constitutional obligation is to take the advice of the Attorney General, whose advice I sought. His advice was that I could introduce this measure. If it subsequently transpires in the courts that I am not correct, I will accept that decision.</P>
      <P>However, I will not accept and should not be expected to accept the definitive views of people given in furtherance of an objective which I cannot see when the advice from the Attorney General is quite categoric. It is not a matter for an individual to decide what is constitutional. Under the Constitution that function is reserved for the courts and nobody else may decide. I would not be so presumptuous, even taking the advice of the Attorney General, to stand in the House on any legislation and categorically state that it is constitutional.</P>
      <P>I will happily return to this issue next week, but before doing so I wish to state that the demonisation which&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The demonisation which has become a feature of the debate on the Bill does less credit to some of the people making the wild allegations than to me. I have listened to nonsense in this House and elsewhere over a long period from certain Members in Opposition regarding the enforcement and observance of human rights in Ireland. The greatest repository of human rights in this jurisdiction is contained in Bunreacht na hÉireann, 1937, which was drafted by the then Fianna Fáil Administration led by Mr. de Valera. Subsequent to that, the provisions <Col N="1065" /> of the Constitution in so far as they relate to human rights have been interpreted in successive Supreme Court decisions, which have served to expand upon human rights like few other jurisdictions in the free world. There are experts who venture to suggest that the rights enumerated by the Constitution and expanded upon by the Supreme Court are perhaps more expansive and even superior to those set out anywhere in the world and that may include the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the fact that this convention was not incorporated into Irish law despite the fact that Ireland was the first to ratify it, and that is true. However, it is entirely disingenuous for members of the Opposition who have been in Government to come into the House and berate the Government about incorporation of the convention into Irish law when they had the opportunity and did not do so. I have stated categorically over recent months that it is my intention to bring forward proposals to the Government to incorporate the convention into our law. This is the first time in the history of the State that any Government has said it will do so. The Taoiseach was the first statesman in Ireland to agree to do so under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I wish to expand further on our human rights record and the criticism of me and the Government. Since coming to office we have introduced more legislation relating to human rights than any Administration in the history of the State. The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, which was struck down by the Supreme Court, was amended, brought before the House by me on behalf of the Government and enacted. It provides for a range of rights and terms of employment which could not have been envisaged before. The Equal Status Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and which will provide for the elimination of discrimination in the provision of services, is the most innovative Bill of this or any other age. As a consequence of the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, being struck down in the Supreme Court, the Equal Status Bill, 1997, was also deemed unconstitutional. We in the Department went through that legislation with a fine comb, line by line, section by section, until we could bring it back before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating Second Stage of a Bill which will put a human rights commission on a statutory footing that will have far-reaching powers to inquire into human rights abuses, to act as <i>amicus curiae</i> for the courts and to apply to the courts to secure an individual's human rights. I wish to pose a question to Deputies Howlin and Higgins and all the other critics. Can they stand in this House and honestly say to the Government that our record on human rights deserves the demonisation and unyielding criticism that they have brought to bear on it when our record stands <Col N="1066" /> head and shoulders above anything they did in Government?</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will stick to the facts unlike the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the previous debate. I want to ascertain some details on the forestry package which was submitted to Brussels in August 1999 seeking increased grants for the forestry industry. I understood the Minister would make an announcement in this regard at the National Ploughing Championships held in the autumn but apparently he did not have any information at that time. I was then informed that details of the package would be announced in October but, again, I did not hear anything. I was subsequently informed that details would be announced in the new year but we are now in the third month of this year and nothing has happened although this is the planting season. The public is not aware of what is happening and I hope the Minister has some information for me tonight about this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has failed dismally to achieve the target of 25,000 hectares per annum outlined in the last plan covering the period 1996-2000. Some 21,000 hectares were planted in 1996 under the previous Government. This Government's performance is anything but encouraging. In 1997, only 11,438 hectares were planted, 12,928 hectares were planted in 1998 and in 1999 only 12,667 hectares were planted. Those figures are a far cry from the target of 25,000 hectares per annum.</P>
    <P>Forestry is a vital industry in Ireland and has an important environmental role to play in the achievement of the country's CO2 targets under the Kyoto Protocol. It is envisaged that the timber industry will be the third largest sector in Ireland by the year 2015. If that is to be realised, a comprehensive tree planting policy is required immediately. Pious words will not meet targets. I do not need to remind the Minister that we have the best climatic conditions in Europe for growing trees. Ireland enjoys the fastest growing rate of timber production in Europe.</P>
    <P>A decade ago, forestry may not have seemed to be one of the most obvious forms of long-term investment but for those who saw the wood for the trees, afforestation proved to be an attractive option. In 1996, the then Government published a strategic forestry plan which set out to double the forest area in Ireland to 17% by the year 2015. Four years after that plan, just over 9% of the total area of the country is covered by forest whereas the EU average is 31%. Actions speak louder than words. It is no good producing glossy pamphlets which encourage people to engage in forestry production. The Minister must make it attractive for Irish farmers to participate in the forestry industry. I am very disappointed with the Department's inaction. The Minister must act immediately before it is too late.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have been concerned for some time about the shortfall in forestry planting as compared with the targets set. Indeed, the Deputy raised this issue during Question Time some weeks ago. Early last year I initiated a review of the factors which lay behind this shortfall. It was evident from the review that, <i>inter alia</i>, significant changes in afforestation grants and premia would be required to create sufficient incentives to stimulate a substantial increase in the rate of planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the review, I decided to bring forward and accelerate the making of a submission to the Commission for changes in premia and grant rates under the existing legal framework of the CAP afforestation programme rather than await the submission of proposals in early 2000 in <Col N="1070" /> the context of the new rural development programme. The Commission has until the end of June this year to decide on the rural development plan which, in addition to forestry, covers REPS, farm retirement and headage.</P>
    <P>Our forestry submission was made in August 1999. Following some initial contacts with the Commission, the advice at that time was that it would be possible to negotiate a favourable package and to conclude negotiation reasonably quickly. I should say in this regard that there has been an intensive ongoing engagement with the Commission at all levels including with the Commissioner and his most senior officials. In fact, this issue has been given top priority in the Forest Service for the past eight months. We have maintained contacts by all means &ndash; letters, phone calls and meetings &ndash; at all levels in DG VI of the Commission with officials, the Director General and the Commissioner. These contacts have been made at official and ministerial level.</P>
    <P>There has, of course, been a significant level of reorganisation within DG VI, the agriculture side of the Commission, reflecting the importance now attached to rural development policy. Changes in personnel unfortunately contributed to the delay in dealing with our proposals as did the changeover from the CAP programme which ended on 31 December 1999 and the new rural development programme which applies from 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>The current state of play is that our proposals on afforestation grants were accepted in principle by the Commission last month. In spite of our best efforts, a satisfactory package did not emerge at that time in respect of premium increases. We have continued to push this issue and I led a delegation to Brussels on Monday for top level discussions.</P>
    <P>Arising from those discussions, negotiations are now at a very advanced stage. I am confident that I can secure a satisfactory outcome shortly, which will present increased opportunities for those interested in afforestation during the planting season. I also reaffirm the commitment which I have already given that the increased rates for both afforestation grants and premia will apply to planting undertaken in the current season. I hope to make an early announcement.</P>
    <P>Obviously, my first priority has been to secure optimum increases for those planting in the current season. I am also aware of the need to ensure satisfactory premium increases for those who have planted prior to now. The Commission is aware of my concerns in that regard. Further approaches to the Commission will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy would agree I am doing the right thing by sticking it out, to get the best possible deal for those who planted in the current season and will plant in the future.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is acquainted with hyp<Col N="1071" /> eractive attention deficit disorder and attention deficit disorder from his term in the Department of Education and Science and this is recognised by the relevant groups. Representations have been made to the Department and these were responded to in a letter sent to Mary Farrell on 21 February. The Minister has allocated £30,000 to a national review of this issue. The problem I wish to bring to the attention of the House is that these two groups have funded themselves in recent years without any assistance from the Eastern Health Board or the Department of Health and Children. The people involved have used their homes, telephones, faxes and so on to liaise with families who have problems with these disorders and with the Department of Health and Children. They have been acting as intermediaries between the relevant organisations and the Department of Health and Children, without receiving any reimbursement. They are not looking for salaries but for a refund of their expenses. They have now reached their limit. The Southern Health Board has funded the Munster group but the Eastern Health Board or the Department has not done the same for the Leinster group.</P>
      <P>These disorders are a major problem and this is reflected in gross absenteeism from primary and secondary schools, although schools and parents are often unable to diagnose the difficulty. Some of the children involved have been brought before the courts &ndash; I see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue is present. Testing and psychiatric care are unavailable. I appreciate the Minister has only recently taken up this portfolio. However, he was active in working for these groups when he was in the Department of Education and Science and I know this will continue in his current office.</P>
      <P>I am asking for the provision of facilities for these groups in the short-term. I spoke to Brid Clarke of the Eastern Health Board regarding this matter and an office in Carmichael House is being made available. However, I ask the Minister to look at the funding of the groups immediately. He has allocated funding for a national review of the disorders by chief executive officers of the health boards. Given the good work done by these two groups, I ask that officials from the Minister's Department meet the groups, ascertain their problems and ensure these facilities continue to be provided for the families affected. I would like the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to work together on this serious problem which affects 5% of the children on the national school register. I ask the Minister to ensure a meeting takes place soon to make provisions similar to those he made when he was Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this matter. The diagnosis, assessment and treatment of attention <Col N="1072" /> deficit disorder, ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, normally comes within the remit of the child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board area. The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority by my Department. Each of the health boards now has a dedicated, multi-disciplinary child and adolescent psychiatric service led by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. It is proposed that children and adults with attention deficit disorder will be provided for under this service.</P>
      <P>A draft policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been completed by Dr. Paul McCarthy, adviser to my Department on child and adolescent psychiatry. The draft development plan, which was circulated to all health boards for comments, includes consideration of the specific needs of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The views of the health boards are currently being considered and a final report is in preparation.</P>
      <P>I recognise the important role of the voluntary sector in the provision of health and social services. It is acknowledged that local support groups have an important role to play, in many instances, in identifying needs in the community and in developing responses to them. In relation to the level of funding available for support groups for children suffering from ADD and ADHD, I am aware that some health boards have already provided financial assistance, as Deputy Wall said, to support groups operating in their respective functional areas and I understand that a number of health boards are in direct consultation with local support groups to discuss their needs, including funding requirements and what role the groups might have in the future development of services.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, additional revenue resources of approximately £3 million have been provided since 1998 to enable improvements to be undertaken in the child and adolescent services, including development of services for children suffering from attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children published a report on attention deficit disorder in lreland in April 1999. One of the recommendations of the report was that £30,000 be made available to enable a national study to be undertaken on the prevalence of attention deficit disorder. I recently announced that I was happy to take this recommendation on board. I have provided the funding to enable this survey to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that I recognise that children and adults with these conditions have particular needs and I intend to make provision for these requirements as part of the overall development of child and adolescent psychiatric and adult mental health services over the next few years. I would be agreeable to organising a meet<Col N="1073" /> ing between the groups concerned and officials from my Department to progress the matters which are outstanding with the health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter. The Government stands indicted for not making an effort to ensure that modern legislation prevents some of our graveyards falling into disuse, disrepair and dereliction. Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold's Cross, in my constituency has been greatly improved thanks to a heritage group established by me, the efforts of the Prisons Service and the owner of the cemetery. However, there is a long way to go before it is in an acceptable state as a place of interment for human remains. Goldenbridge Cemetery, now in my constituency, is strewn with used needles, condoms and broken headstones as a result of official toleration of criminal and unseemly behaviour in such a hallowed place. This was the first Catholic cemetery after emancipation. A temple in the graveyard marks the spot where a Mass rock stood in penal times. The first Head of Government of this State, W. T. Cosgrave, is buried there and yet official Ireland deems itself to have no responsibility to address this sad state of affairs. Goldenbridge Cemetery should be a national monument, not a monument to Government indifference. This is a national shame.</P>
      <P>I want the Government to declare Goldenbridge Cemetery a national heritage park and to give the authority, resources and back-up, including inoculation against hepatitis when clearing the cemetery, to local groups to turn this cemetery into a national and international tourist attraction. It is close to Kilmainham Gaol and the place of incarceration of many of the 1916 leaders, now St. Michael's Christian Brothers school. I also want the Government to bring in modern legislation akin to the Derelict Sites Act to prevent cemeteries from falling into disrepair by penalising owners or requiring local authorities to move in and take over the operating of cemeteries which do not meet required standards, passing on the costs to the owners where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a civilised people but one would not know that from a visit to some of our graveyards. Would any of these standards be tolerated in the so-called commercialised United States? Certainly not, and we should not tolerate these standards here either. It is an appalling indictment of us as a nation, and the way we treat our dead shows the adolescence we are going through as a nation. In centuries gone by the dead were always treated with respect. A death notice cannot be put on the door of a house in Dublin, which was the tradition when I was a boy, because somebody might burgle the house when the people are out. If somebody puts an announcement in the newspapers, which again is the tradition, they cannot put the number of the house for the same reason. To add insult to injury, some of the places <Col N="1074" /> of interment of the loved ones of people who grieve with great pain and sorrow are inadequate.</P>
    <P>Dublin has spread out to the west in particular and new graveyards are being opened. The Government cannot allow people to simply walk away from the older graveyards and leave them in a state of dereliction. I appreciate very much the efforts of the management of Mount Jerome Cemetery, together with the group set up by me, the heritage group, and the Prisons Service to try to do something about that cemetery. I am hopeful, particularly with the opening of a crematorium there, that the income from that will be used to restore the cemetery, which is an important heritage centre because of some of the people who are buried there.</P>
    <P>Goldenbridge Cemetery is probably one of the most historic monuments in this country. It is an absolute indictment of us all that there is not in place legislation to prevent such a hallowed place from falling into total disrepair, which would be disrespectful. If it is not possible for the owners of that cemetery, or for the owners of cemeteries generally, to ensure that a proper and dignified environment is maintained within cemeteries, it behoves us as a Legislature to ensure that legislation is in place to provide for that. We would not allow it in terms of derelict sites and we certainly should not allow it in places of burial of human beings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that many of the issues raised by Deputy Mitchell come within my domain but I will attempt to answer them as best I can. I will try to deal with the general issue of the condition of cemeteries in the Dublin area. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, that in</P>
      <P>recent years functions in relation to burial grounds have been devolved from central Government to local authorities with the result that virtually all such functions, including management and maintenance of burial grounds provided by them, are now exercised by the local authorities. Other burial ground owners are responsible for the maintenance and care of their own grounds, although local authorities have power to intervene where a burial ground is not kept in decent order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the issue of crime in cemeteries. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the situation in respect of cemeteries in divisions within the Dublin metropolitan region &ndash; DMR &ndash; is that the statistics from the DMR east division and the DMR north division indicate that the issues raised by the Deputy are not a problem evidenced by crimes reported to the gardaí, while the DMR west division and the DMR south division each have only one such recorded crime for the 14 month period 1 January 1999 to date. These divisions have ten and nine cemeteries respectively. That is not to say, however, that such problems never occur. In recent years, for example, Glasne<Col N="1075" /> vin Cemetery experienced intermittent problems with vandalism, mainly damage to headstones. As a result, the gardaí were given keys to the main gate to enable a patrol to be carried out at night and to facilitate access in the event of receiving a call to the cemetery while it is closed. The cemetery is patrolled by gardaí when it is open between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and in addition to Garda patrols at night, it is visited twice nightly by a private security firm.</P>
    <P>In the same context, problems experienced at Mount Jerome Cemetery in Harold's Cross, in the Deputy's constituency, were successfully tackled through the combined efforts of uniformed gardaí and detectives and improved security measures implemented by those responsible for the upkeep of the cemetery.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Garda authorities are taking appropriate measures to deal with the problem mentioned by Deputy Mitchell, and this seems to be borne out by the statistics from the Dublin metropolitan region. Current Government crime policies are working. Never in the history of the State have the gardaí been better resourced or equipped. Garda strength is heading towards 12,000, an all-time historic high. We are on target for increasing the capacity of the prison system by one third. In reality, our tough anti-crime policies are yielding the anticipated good results, with a further fall of 5% last year leading to a cumulative fall of about 21% since we came to office. I am satisfied that the legislation currently in place, such as the Criminal Law Act, 1997, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1996, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, is appropriate to deal with any such problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the appropriate law enforcement responses to the issues raised by the Deputy. In general terms, however, the problems associated with drug abuse, mentioned by the Deputy, cannot be solved by law enforcement measures alone and as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am fully aware of the correlation between drugs, crime and social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The complex problem of drug abuse is one of the critical issues in modern society and the Government has been active on many different fronts in a bid to reduce the demand for drugs and to relentlessly pursue those profiting from the sale or distribution of drugs. In addition, addressing the causes and consequences of social exclusion in urban and rural areas in an integrated and co-ordinated way is very much a priority of the Government. An unprecedented level of resources is being targeted at areas most in need to facilitate the development of local strategies which aim to address issues such as drug misuse, early school leaving and unemployment. <Col N="1076" /> In this context, the active participation of the local community in developing and implementing appropriate policies and programmes to deal with the drug problem is a cornerstone of the Government's national drugs strategy. The Government is totally committed to this multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the twin problems of drugs and crime at community level.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am sure Deputy Mitchell will agree that tremendous progress has been made through the allocation of funding by the Government under the national drugs strategy and under the young people's facilities and services fund. These resources will make a significant contribution towards dealing with the drugs problem in local communities and towards tackling social exclusion. A total of £10 million has been allocated on an annual basis to support the implementation of over 200 projects proposed by local drugs task forces in their areas. In addition, a further £15 million over a two year period has been allocated to support the development of new service development plans by the local drugs task forces. The Government has also allocated a sum of £35 million over three years, 1999 to 2001, under the young people's facilities and services fund to assist in the development of preventative strategies, in a targeted manner, through the development of youth, sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <P>On top of this funding significant amounts are being made available to deal with the issues of social exclusion and disadvantage under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In this context, I have secured an additional £16 million of funding under this plan which will facilitate a significant expansion of the Garda juvenile diversion programme. I have also secured approximately £70 million for additional crime prevention measures and over £200 million to fund the development of the child care provision over 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>Gaelscoil Uí Cheidhe in Bray, County Wicklow was founded in 1994. That year one teacher was employed and 26 children attended the school. Currently, there are seven teachers and 135 pupils in the school, a clear indication that it is a success.</P>
      <P>However, the school is a victim of its own success. In its short existence it has moved four times and is currently located in a large Victorian house in Bray. The house is inappropriate and does not cater for even the basic needs of the school. The problems experienced by staff and children include overcrowding, poorly ventilated classrooms and no personal space for pupils either indoors or outdoors. Teachers teach in rooms with no space for the teacher's desk or chair, Irish dancing classes are held in a narrow corridor and the school yard consists of a small backyard where close to 75 children play. There is no classroom available for incoming pupils in September 2000.</P>
      <P>There are serious health and safety issues relating to the school. The staff and parents have explored every possible avenue to resolve their desperate situation. They attended two hearings of An Bord Pleanála where their need was acknowledged but not acted upon. They have hunted down every possible site to no avail. Land availability in Bray is severely limited by topographical and planning factors. They have approached Bray UDC and received full support for their case but no solution. So far, none of this effort has led to a solution to their considerable difficulties and the substandard nature of their accommodation.</P>
      <P>The school has a vibrant, hard working parents' committee and a team of dedicated teachers working with the board of management. They need to continue the growth and development of the school but they cannot do so without the intervention of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What makes the situation so frustrating is that there is a clear and obvious way to deal with the problem. There is accommodation close by in the town of Bray which was built for education purposes. The building has classrooms, a staff room, corridors of a decent width so children do not knock into each other and the ancillary facilities necessary in a school. The yard is not great but it <Col N="1078" /> is better than the one the school is forced to use at present.</P>
    <P>The building is the former St. Cronan's boys national school building, recently vacated and now lying idle. Presumably, it was built with public money although it is in church ownership. When the principal, on behalf of the school, wrote to the Archbishop of Dublin, Desmond O'Connell, seeking to lease the premises she was refused. The letter she received from Monsignor John Wilson, financial administrator, stated that it was not diocesan policy to permit the leasing of properties. The letter stated also that the property was that of the parish, not the diocese or the Archbishop, and recommended that she contact the Department of Education and Science on the matter.</P>
    <P>The problem is clear and urgent and the following questions must be answered. First, is the Minister for Education and Science willing to countenance the current substandard accommodation of Scoil Uí Cheidhe? Second, will he set about immediately making the arrangements necessary to acquire the building at St. Cronan's to accommodate the gaelscoil while a permanent home is developed for the gaelscoil? Third, will he guarantee that this school will be able to provide adequate accommodation for the new intake of pupils in September 2000 and that the accommodation will be of a proper standard in terms of the space, safety and facilities to which all children are entitled?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science asked me to extend his apologies to Deputy McManus for his inability to be here this evening. He asked me to thank Deputy McManus for giving him the opportunity to outline the current position on accommodation for Scoil Uí Cheidhe. At present, the school has a staffing of a principal teacher, five assistants and one remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that due to the growth of enrolments at the school, the current accommodation is no longer adequate to meet demand. In that regard, the school authorities have applied to the Department for a new school building and this matter is being considered. In the meantime, the Department's architects will shortly visit the school to assess the immediate short-term accommodation requirements. The Minister appreciates the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and it is the intention of his Department to provide adequate accommodation for the future needs of Scoil Uí Cheidhe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that there is a large number of school building projects on hand in the Department. Due to the priority which the Government has given to reversing the evident previous neglect of primary schools, the spending Estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increased by an unpre<Col N="1079" /> cedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have reduced significantly the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by <Col N="1080" /> Scoil Uí Cheidhe will be dealt with as speedily as possible in the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>The strategy seeks to maximise the level and quality of employment in the industry and to enhance links with related sectors. It contains an implementation plan based around 19 priorities. One of these priorities was that relevant Departments and agencies would nominate liaison officers where they did not already exist. These officers meet on a regular basis as an IFSC public sector group, chaired by my Department, to ensure that the strategy is implemented. The group met for the first time in March 1999 and has met a total of six times since then.</P>
      <P>The success we have achieved in implementing the strategy is evident from the progress report which was initially prepared by the public sector group and was subsequently submitted to Government on 22 February.

    <P>I was pleased to welcome Geraldine Finucane <Col N="1082" /> and other members of the Finucane family to Government Buildings together with representatives of a number of human rights organisations, both domestic and international. The meeting enabled us to have a comprehensive review of developments in the case. The case has been, and remains, a cause of the deepest concern to the Government. Pat Finucane's murder was not only abhorrent in itself &ndash; it also represents a fundamental attack on the legal profession and the system of justice.</P>
    <P>At the meeting, a copy of British-Irish Rights Watch's latest report on the case was handed over, as well as a legal opinion from Amnesty International which argues that there is no legal barrier to the holding of a public inquiry while a police investigation is under way.</P>
    <P>For my part, I restated our clear view that the case for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane is compelling.  This view has already been conveyed to the British Government. After the lapse of more than a decade since Pat Finucane's murder, and the serious allegations in relation to it, the Government strongly share the view that a public inquiry needs to be established into all the circumstances surrounding this appalling murder.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of invalidity pension requires that the person must be permanently incapable of work. While there is a general rule that invalidity pensioners are not allowed to engage in work, it is nonetheless recognised that support and encouragement should be provided for people with disabilities and those with long-term incapacities to become more self-reliant and less dependent on the social welfare system by facilitating them in taking up available employment and training opportunities.</P>
      <P>In this regard, invalidity pensioners are allowed to engage in occupational training where they are incapable of following their usual occupation and also to engage in rehabilitative or therapeutic work. No income limits apply to such employment and training. However, an invalidity pensioner must obtain prior approval from the Department before engaging in such activity.</P>
      <P>My Department has entered into an arrangement whereby certification by the NRB that an invalidity pensioner requires rehabilitative training or employment is accepted for the purposes of allowing them to continue to receive full payment and engage in such activity. Some 2,500 invalidity pensioners are currently engaged in rehabilitative training or employment, almost 2,000, 80%, of whom have been certified by the NRB. Out of the overall total of 2,500, over 1,400 invalidity pensioners, 57%, are engaged in the CE programme or other FÁS employment options, while almost 570 people, 23%, are engaged in part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a package of measures to further enhance the social welfare supports for people with disabilities, the recent budget provided for two important improvements for invalidity pensioners. First, the back to work allowance scheme, which currently applies to recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension, is being extended from April to invalidity pensioners. Participants in this scheme can take up employment in the open labour market and continue to receive their social welfare payment on a sliding <Col N="1084" /> scale over a three year period, four years if they take up self-employment. Second, the back to education allowance is also being extended to invalidity pensioners from September next. Participants in this scheme can continue to receive their full weekly payment while undergoing approved second or third level education courses. In addition, a cost of education allowance of £200 is paid towards the cost of books and related expenses.</P>
    <P>The range of employment, training and education supports provided by my Department for people with disabilities will continue to be developed in the light of the experience gained in the operation of the existing and proposed new supports and having regard to the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <P>This Department funds a number of community development support programmes, namely, the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme and the programme of core-funding for locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage. The number of funded projects has risen from 15 in 1990 to 90 at present. Partnership 2000 committed the Department to drawing up a list of 30 priority areas/communities of interest to be targeted for the development of new community development programme projects. This commitment has, in fact, been exceeded, with an expected 40 new projects being established over the next eighteen months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission on the family recommended that a network of 100 family and community services resource centres be established over a four to five year period. At the end of 1999, 61 centres were being funded or had been approved in principle for funding. It is expected that a further 15 centres will be established by the end of 2000. In addition, ten new core funded community and family support groups will be established. This represents a very high increase in the number of funded projects to come on stream over the next 18 months or so. It involves a considerable concentration of development work by this Department and the regional support agencies during that period. Increased funding for the future expansion of the community development support programmes has been addressed in both the national development plan and in the programme for prosperity and fairness. The programmes will <Col N="1085" /> receive £100 million over the lifetime of the national development plan. This is £2 million to £4 million more per annum than the 1999 provision.</P>
    <P>Further expansion in the number of community development support programme projects falls to be considered within the parameters of the NDP funding envelope, when the current expansion has been consolidated.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper on Voluntary Activity was published in 1997, with a view to initiating a consultation process with the voluntary and community sector leading to publication of a White Paper. A steering group has been brought together to advise and assist the Department on a consultation process in relation to the White Paper and to advise on issues and directions for the White Paper. The members of the group have been selected on an individual basis to give of their individual expertise and experience in advising the Department.</P>
      <P>I have been conscious of the need to have extensive consultation so that the White Paper properly and adequately reflects the issues that are of real importance to the sector and that there is genuine consultation in this regard. The consultation process with the voluntary and community sector provided for a three phased approach. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The final phase will provide for a national seminar to which people will be invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their discussion papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and second phases of the consultation process have now been completed. A total of 81 submissions were received by my Department and 56 regional seminars have taken place in different locations around the country. The final phase is now being planned. My Department, in consultation with the steering group, is currently drafting a number of discussion papers reflecting the issues which have been raised in the first two phases of the consultation process. These papers will be presented at the national seminar which will be held on 30 March this year at the Grand Hotel, Malahide. The national seminar will provide the opportunity for people who have been involved in the initial phases to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their papers. Following completion of the consultation process, <Col N="1086" /> and in line with the commitment expressed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is envisaged that the White Paper will be published in April this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 30 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people who need full time care and attention. At the end of January 2000, there were 14,964 carer's allowances in payment. This represents a 60% increase in the number of carers claiming the allowance since this Government took office. Of this number, 12,302 or over 80% of carer's allowance were payable at the maximum rate and 2,662 were in payment at a reduced rate.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that the carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment and concluded that the practice of paying only one allowance should continue as this is a fundamental feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>The review also examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The review noted that the means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that increasing the means disregards to £125 for a single person and £250 for a couple would increase the payment of approxi<Col N="1087" /> mately 2,200 existing carers at a cost of approximately £3.5 million. It is very difficult to estimate the number of additional carers who would qualify as income data are not available. However, it is estimated that additional costs in the region of £13 million would be incurred if an estimated additional 3,000 carers qualified leading to a total increase of £16.5 million approximately in overall expenditure.</P>
    <P>The position and operation of the means test and income disregards will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of individualising social welfare payments was considered in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting, and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes which was published in August last year.</P>
      <P>The group noted that individualisation already exists to a certain extent, first, in the social insurance system in that those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right; and also in the old age non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements. Much has already been <Col N="1089" /> achieved in this area over the past 12 years with coverage being extended to the self employed, 1988, part-time workers, 1991 and new civil-public servants, 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>
    <P>The working group also proposed, on foot of research on equivalence scales undertaken by the ESRI for the group, that the qualified adult allowance should be increased to 70% of the personal rate. The Government intends to reach this recommended level for the QAA over a period of three budgets and the process was started in the recent budget with increases of between 8% to 17% being provided.</P>
    <P>In principle, the QAA rate is set at less than 100% of the personal rate on the basis that there are economies of scale where two people live together in the same household, and that account should be taken of these economies where the second person does not have a direct entitlement to the payment in his or her own right.</P>
    <P>The working group also considered administrative individualisation which, for example, would allow for the payment of the QAA direct to the person concerned. There was general agreement towards extending the administrative arrangements in the area of separate payments.</P>
    <P>The question of making such separate payments in all cases involves some complex social issues which need to be considered carefully. It also raises questions about the position of the qualified adult when the social welfare payment is no longer payable, for example, when the recipient takes up employment. In addition there would be some administrative and cost implications.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the programme for prosperity and fairness is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means. In this regard working groups will be established under the programme to produce proposals to progress the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system, and to produce proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social insurance model which would facilitate combining work and family responsibilities in the context of changing working and social patterns.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997 with the overall target of reducing the proportion of households in consistent poverty from 9%-15% <Col N="1090" /> to less than 5%-10% by 2007. Targets and objectives were also set in relation to each of the five key themes of unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
      <P>In June 1999, the first annual report of the NAPS interdepartmental policy committee was published. Along with the ESRI's Monitoring Poverty Trends report, it revealed that substantial progress had been made towards the original NAPS poverty and unemployment targets. Crucially, the level of consistent poverty had been reduced from 9%-15% to 7%-10%. The rate of unemployment and long-term unemployment had continued to fall.</P>
      <P>In light of these developments, and as part of this Government's social inclusion strategy, I announced a revised target to reduce the numbers in consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004. In addition, the employment action plan contains a target to reduce unemployment to below 5% and long-term unemployment to below 2% by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The new figures also prompted the Government to consider moving into a new phase with the NAPS, encompassing a broader social inclusion strategy which would rebase the original targets and begin to consider new areas where a strategic response could be used to alleviate exclusion.</P>
      <P>I announced in the preface to the IDPC report that the Government had asked the Committee to draw up new targets to reflect the changed environment, for example in relation to education and adult literacy, and to consider action targets in relation to particular groups such as children in poverty. It was also noted that the input of the social partners in target setting would be valuable in this regard.</P>
      <P>The NAPS IDPC considered a &lsquo;next steps' approach during the latter quarter of 1999 and was aware of the need to tie in any new direction with the contexts created by, for example, the national development plan and any new national agreement.</P>
      <P>While the proposed new agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has yet to be ratified, it has provided a timely opportunity to develop approaches, with the social partners, to important strategic issues that were being considered in the social inclusion area. It is proposed that the NAPS will be updated, the underlying methodology reviewed, and the existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate. In particular, new targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people and housing-accommodation. This process will be completed during the first 18 months of the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed investment of £1.5 billion in social inclusion during the course of the agreement is testament to this Government's commitment in this area. The comprehensive section on social inclusion in the proposed new national <Col N="1091" /> agreement ensures that the policy focus will remain fixed in on this issue in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. To assist in its implementation, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing which were distributed to all Departments last year.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing of significant policy proposals is a major tool in assisting this Government in halting the drift towards a two-tier society by keeping social inclusion to the fore in policy-making at all times. It ensures that Departments are kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system to which this Government is committed as part of its strategy on social inclusion. All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to a review of the process, it was agreed with the social partners during the initial discussions that poverty proofing would be reviewed and revised if necessary after a period of one year. Proposals for an independent study are being pursued and I expect that the review will be started shortly. It is hoped that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation.</P>
      <P>In advance of the review, and to assist in informing it, the NAPS unit in my Department has asked Departments to report on their experience of the process to date and has already received some particularly useful and informative replies which will feed into the above review.</P>

      <P>The proposed programme for prosperity and fairness provides a pathway for an expanded strategy on social inclusion. It allows us to build on the achievements to date and examine new areas from which poverty and exclusion can originate and persist. <Col N="1092" /> Housing and health are two of these and the Government's record on employment and unemployment has seen significant movements of people into work and off the dole queues.</P>
      <P>It is important that new directions in social policy are founded on a solid basis and research provides the opportunity to provide the data necessary to help ensure that we are targeting the right people with the right policies. In addition, research can lend weight to existing policy, allowing opportunities to improve and refine the detail of Government policy to make it more relevant as our society and economy changes. This Government has committed significant funding in these areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to poverty specifically, my Department has committed almost £200,000 to the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out supplementation of the living in Ireland survey, that is to supplement attrition of the sample survey, and to provide an updated analysis of the 1998 data from a poverty perspective, most recent data relate to 1997. The living in Ireland survey has been a valuable source of poverty data in the past and secondary analysis of this data, as carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency among others, has also been extremely useful. The agency, which is funded by my Department, uses a substantial proportion of its budget of approximately £2 million for research purposes.</P>
      <P>In addition, an independent review of the poverty proofing process, introduced in 1998, will be carried out this year, as well as an EU-assisted transnational study &ndash; led by the combat poverty agency and including the NAPS unit, based in my Department, as a partner &ndash; for the development of guidelines for the involvement of excluded persons and the organisations which represent them in the development, implementation and evaluation of social inclusion and anti-poverty strategies.</P>
      <P>The proposed new partnership agreement also contains commitments which show the value which this Government and the social partners attach to research in this area. These include: to provide relevant data and data collection systems for the monitoring and evaluation of poverty, including systems of  measuring poverty among groups not currently included, for example, people living in institutions, Travellers and the homeless and to allocate resources to health research as part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring adequate medium and long-term planning and health provision. Data systems will be adapted to enable disaggregation of health access and outcomes across NAPS target groups. This data will be  monitored and reported on at national level.</P>
      <P>The proposed new agreement also contains many commitments in relation to housing, including the consideration of housing as a NAPS target area. Any decision in relation to this and other areas will be informed by relevant and recent data and the results of appropriate research.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 40 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance, to carers of people in receipt of prescribed relatives and constant attendance allowance and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement provided that prior to the death of the spouse or partner, the couple were permanently residing together. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The 1997 budget allowed recipients, regardless of age, who transferred from invalidity pension, disability allowance or blind person's pension to any other social welfare payment, including widow/er's pension, to retain their entitlement to the free schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a review of the free schemes is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the policy institute, Trinity College, Dublin. The purpose of the review is to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient man<Col N="1094" /> ner. The many proposals put forward by Deputies are addressed in the review. It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the policy institute in the Trinity Studies in Public Policy series in March 2000. Any proposals arising in the context of this review would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As part of its employment support services, my Department provides a wide range of second chance education opportunities for unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The objective in providing these opportunities is to raise educational and skills levels among the long-term unemployed to help them in their search for employment.</P>
      <P>The courses covered under the back to education allowance scheme range from basic education in areas such as literacy to a wide and diverse range of third level and post-graduate courses of study. The scheme targets resources at those most at risk from long-term unemployment and is intended to equip those who participate with the educational qualifications necessary to secure employment in a labour market with an expanding demand for graduates. I believe that the programmes are extremely relevant and worthwhile in the context of the current labour market.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, I merged the separate second and third level allowance schemes into one unified back to education allowance scheme. There has been no decline in the numbers participating in the scheme. In fact, the number of participants has grown from 67 in the inaugural academic year 1990-1, to 5,317 in the current academic year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme operated from 1 June to 31 August in 1999. A total of 15,833 students applied for inclusion in the scheme and 11,902 were approved for participation. Of these 9,200 worked. A total of £5.4 million was paid to sponsors.</P>
      <P>The scheme was not designed to compete with jobs on offer in the open labour market. It is based primarily on community type work as distinct from commercial type activity. Its primary focus is to provide an income and work experience to less well off third level students who are unable to obtain work during the summer months.</P>
      <P>In a tightening labour market situation it would not be advisable to take students out of the mainstream labour supply and primarily for this reason I do not intend to increase the rate of pay available under the scheme. The reduction in demand for the scheme over the past number of years reflects the wider availability of jobs, especially in the services and tourism sectors. From a labour supply perspective, this trend should be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>Demand for places under the scheme has been steadily declining over the past three years. Last year for example the number of applications was down 24% on 1988 while the number of students who took part in the scheme declined by 32% on the previous year.</P>

      <P>The final report on the first phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions is nearing completion and will be presented to me very shortly. As I indicated in my budget speech, the review is looking closely at the operation of the current yearly average test and the implications of moving to a total contributions approach, which many people consider would be a more equitable approach. I will report back to the House in due course when Government has considered the report.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have already introduced two significant pension-related provisions in this year's Social Welfare Bill. The first relates to significant improvements in the current structure of the rates bands for the retirement and old age contributory pensions. From next May, some 38,000 pensioners who are in receipt of reduced-rate, standard pensions will receive increases over and above what was announced on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am addressing certain anomalies in the qualifying conditions for the retirement and old age contributory pensions. Certain people who had paid contributions prior to 1953 failed to qualify for these pensions as these contributions are not taken into account for the yearly average test. From May, these people may qualify for a special old age contributory pension at 50% of the maximum personal rate if they have, at least, five years, or 260, social insurance contributions paid under the national health insurance Acts or a <Col N="1098" /> combination of pre and post 1953 insurance.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey cannot be compared directly with the live register as they track different events. Consequently, the QNHS level of unemployment for June-August 1999, was 101,100, whereas the average live register for the period was 198,200. There are a number of reasons for this divergence relating to differing methodologies, different timeframe and different definitions.</P>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey is estimated from a sample survey of 39,000 households which are then applied to population estimates by the Central Statistics Office. The live register on the other hand is an administrative count of the numbers of persons in receipt of or claiming unemployment payments or signing for credited contribution. It is based on a register of actual persons rather than a sample survey based estimate.</P>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey is conducted each quarter on a continuous basis over a 13 week period. The live register is a point-in-time estimate at the end of each month and it may thus include persons who have claimed benefit but whose claim has not yet been decided. It also includes those who have left unemployment but whose claims will not be removed from the register until the next signing day.</P>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey uses definitions of the international labour organisation to separate the population into three distinct groups; employed, unemployed and inactive. A person is classified as being in employment if he or she worked for one or more hours for payment or profit, in the previous week. On the other hand the live register includes part-time workers, those who work up to three days a week and seasonal and casual workers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore those signing the live register for credits are obliged to be available for work only and may not be actively seeking work. They might thus be classified as inactive according to the quarterly national household survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that those who are long-term unemployed on the live register might fall within the International Labour Organisation category of &ldquo;discouraged workers&rdquo; who are classified as economically inactive. These are persons who because of lack of educational qualifications or because they live in an area where employment is scarce, may have ceased active search for employment. In June-August 1999, the CSO esti<Col N="1099" /> mated that those who were marginally attached to the labour force numbered 17,700.</P>
    <P>The CSO now publishes a wider range of indicators or potential supply in the labour market than the quarterly national household survey headline unemployment figure which is based on criteria drawn up the International Labour Organisation (ILO). These are considerably higher than the headline unemployment estimate. While in the period June-August 1999 the ILO numbers unemployed were estimated at 5.7% of the labour force, the broader indicators of potential labour supply ranged from 6.4% to 10.3%. Using these broader indicators it is clear that the divergence referred to in the question is much less significant than a strict comparison with the ILO measure.</P>

      <P>The contract under which An Post supplies payments delivery services to my Department reached the end of its term on 31 December last. The Government had previously decided that the term of this contract should be extended for a further three years, 2000 to 2002 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract have been raised with the EU Commission by a third party which feels aggrieved by the Government's decision. In accordance with its <Col N="1100" /> usual practice in these matters, the Commission referred these complaints to my Department for its observations.</P>
    <P>Responses to complaints, and the complex legal issues upon which they are based, have been sent to the Commission. I understand the Commission is currently examining the arguments advanced by the complainant and the observations supplied by my Department. It would be entirely inappropriate for me to speculate about this process or its ultimate outcome at this stage.</P>
    <P>The necessity to address and resolve the issues raised with the EU Commission has delayed the completion of a new three year contract. In the meantime, recognising that the payment delivery service which An Post provides to my Department's customers must continue without interruption, my Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide these services on an interim basis. The Commission has been notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have already reiterated this Government's commitment to maintain a network of post offices. While not wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the issues being considered by the EU Commission, I am confident that An Post will continue to have an important role in the delivery of services for my Department. Needless to say, the Government intends to fully comply with its EU obligations in this matter, once they have been definitively established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community development support programmes were included in the national development plan with a commitment of over £100 million over the lifetime of the plan. These programmes focus on investment in capacity building, so that socially excluded groups and local communities can be active participants in identifying and meeting their own development <Col N="1101" /> needs, working alongside the other social partners.</P>
    <P>Applications from groups seeking inclusion in these programmes are assessed by an independent technical group established to advise me on the selection of new areas and groups for funding. Applications must fulfil the following criteria for inclusion in the programmes. They must have a commitment to an anti-poverty focus; provide support and act as a catalyst for community development activity; act as a resource in the communities of which they are a part; promote co-ordination and co-operation between community, voluntary and statutory groups in the area; involve local people drawn from groups who themselves experience poverty and social exclusion within their management structures; and demonstrate a commitment, in principle and practice, to operate from an equality perspective.</P>
    <P>Some 90 projects are currently participating in the community development programme and an additional 40 projects will come on stream over the next 18 months. At present, 61 centres are being funded or have been approved in principle for funding under the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme. It is expected that a further 15 centres will be established by the end of 2000. In addition, funding for a further ten groups under the core funded community and family support groups programme has been provided.  </P>
    <P>In assessing priorities for the expansion of these support programmes, the technical group first gathered baseline information. In this regard the technical group had a report Targeting Disadvantage under the Community Development Programme which was commissioned at its request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The report rearranged all areas of the State by reference to comparative disadvantage. Further information gathering, at regional level, was undertaken by the regional support agencies. In addition the establishment of new projects in rural areas has been identified as a priority. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness there is a commitment that the number of projects will continue to be expanded in rural areas. The current expansion of the programmes is a significant undertaking for my Department and once the new projects are up and running the technical group will be revisiting priority needs for the future expansion of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that research will be carried out in a number of key areas, including poverty, health, education and training. In relation to the monitoring and evaluation of poverty, further research to determine the extent and causes of poverty will be carried out and systems of measuring poverty among groups not currently included will also be examined, such as, people living in institutions, Travellers and the homeless. The programme also provides for new studies to complement the current living in Ireland and household budget surveys, and to address the gender dimensions of poverty.</P>
    <P>In the areas of health, education and training, <Col N="1102" /> the Central Statistics Office, the Equality Authority and relevant Government Departments will develop a system for the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data for women and, in relation to health, education and training for Travellers.</P>
    <P>In addition, resources are to be allocated to health research as part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring adequate medium and long-term planning of health provision. Data systems will be adapted to enable disaggregation of health access and outcomes across NAPS target groups.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the above research will help to inform the targeting of funding at areas of high deprivation.</P>

      <P>The proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the establishment of a social insurance fund board with representation from the social partners will be examined. This examination will be commenced in the near future.</P>
      <P>One of the issues relevant to the establishment of such a board is the Government decision to part pre-fund social welfare pensions. An interdepartmental working group is currently examining the legislative and operational issues surrounding the creation of such a reserve fund. The role and supervisory structures of a social insurance board will, therefore, need to be considered in the context of the legislative arrangements, including supervisory structures, which will be put in place in respect of the new reserve fund. My colleague, the Minister for Finance will be introducing legislative proposals for the setting up of the reserve fund in the coming months. The examination will also need to take into account the possible roles of a social insurance fund board, the composition of such a board including the role of the social partners, the existing legal responsibilities of myself, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the fund, and the legal responsibility, if any, a new board would have. In addition, the role of a new board <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Pensions Board given the latter's existing role in providing advice regarding pensions, including those pensions paid from the fund, would also need to be given detailed consideration.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides assistance to people who have little or no income and is administered on my behalf by the health boards. In addition to a basic payment, people may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, for example a rent or mortgage interest payments or a payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
      <P>There are three current developments which are relevant to the future administration of the scheme. The Social Welfare Bill, 2000, which is before the House at present, provides for changes in the administration of SWA in certain cases where the people concerned also have claims open with my Department. In future, officials in my Department will be able to make SWA payments where appropriate in such cases. It will no longer be necessary for the people concerned to make their case in duplicate at the health board office when they will have already provided all the relevant details to my Department.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided in principle to implement the main recommendations of the report published in August 1999 on the future administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements. A new rent assistance scheme will be put in place, operated by the local authorities, to serve people who have long-term housing needs, including those who currently rely on SWA rent supplements on a long-term basis. Income support elements of the SWA scheme, including assistance with rent costs on a short-term basis, will continue to be met though the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>A fundamental examination of the SWA scheme commenced in February as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. This will review all aspects of the scheme, including policy and administrative issues. The findings are expected next year and will be published.</P>
      <P>Taken together, these initiatives represent the most far-reaching development of the scheme since its inception in 1977. The changes already envisaged and those that will be recommended in the programme evaluation review will improve customer service and administrative efficiency. However, more importantly, they provide an opportunity to refocus the scheme, and the community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>

      <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers was operated under EU legislation which provided for the supply of butter to social assistance beneficiaries and their dependants at subsidised rates. The subsidy was provided by means of vouchers, the printing and distribution of which was arranged by my Department. Used vouchers are redeemed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>The number of social assistance beneficiaries and their dependants who were entitled to benefit under the scheme for each of the years from 1997 to 1999 was as follows:</P>
      <P>1997&ndash;527,000 claimants and 390,000 dependants</P>
      <P>1998&ndash;476,000 claimants and 315,000 dependants</P>
      <P>1999&ndash;465,000 claimants and 313,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The gross value of vouchers distributed in these years was as follows:</P>
      <P>1997&ndash;£5,565,000</P>
      <P>1998&ndash;£5,336,000</P>
      <P>1999&ndash;£3,736,000.</P>
      <P>I understand that the extent to which vouchers are redeemed varies from year to year and was as low as 58% in 1998 and 70% in 1999.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of administering the scheme by my Department in each of these years is estimated as follows:</P>
      <P>1997&ndash;£1,394,000</P>
      <P>1998&ndash;£1,273,000</P>
      <P>1999&ndash;£ 828,000.</P>
      <P>These costs cover printing charges, postage charges for distribution of vouchers and the pay costs in respect of the estimated time spent by staff in administering the scheme. The reduction in administrative costs in 1999 was due in the main to savings in postage and staff time as a result of changes in the frequency at which vouchers were issued to some beneficiaries.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department currently provides child income support through the payment of child benefit and child dependant allowances and through the family income supplement scheme. These payments are not designed specifically to meet childcare costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of childcare generally goes beyond the provision of payments in respect of child care costs. The recent budget, for instance, provides for substantial investment in the development of <Col N="1105" /> child care facilities.

    <P>In the context of the negotiations on the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government has committed to adopting, by the end of 2000 and following a process of discussions with the social partners, an equitable strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs, for implementation in the period of the programme. This process will address proposals advanced in the course of the negotiations on the new programme, which included proposals for direct payments per child.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the commitment in Partnership 2000 to modify the withdrawal rate of rent supplement, through the introduction of an appropriate tapering arrangement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the withdrawal of rent supplements paid under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme could act as a disincentive to those seeking to take up employment in some cases. The primary difficulties relate to the weekly gross income limit and the rent and mortgage interest supplement cap of £250 per month as these limit the effectiveness of the two schemes, particularly for families with children.</P>
      <P>The conditions for retention of secondary benefits, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, were reviewed in consultation with the social partners in line with the Government's commitment under Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>Following those discussions, the Deputy may be aware that substantial changes to the conditions for the retention of secondary benefits by participants of the employment programme schemes were announced in budget 2000.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement, FIS, and back to work allowance, BTW, payments will be disregarded for the purposes of the weekly £250 gross household income limit. In addition, the £250 cap on monthly rent-mortgage interest supplement will be abolished with effect from 6 April 2000 and the supplement will be tapered out over four years. Some 75% of the previous rate entitlement will be paid in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. The more favourable treatment of people on long-term schemes reflects the fact that such families face a higher risk of poverty.</P>

      <P>Some 7,400 farm families are currently in receipt of payments under the farm assist scheme, and some 800 other claimants of unemployment assistance have yet to transfer to the new scheme.</P>
      <P>While this level of take-up is less than had been anticipated when the scheme was first introduced in April 1999, the benefits to those who have joined the scheme have been significant. Almost 2,300 new claimants are in receipt of payments, with an average weekly payment of £57. This includes 439 claimants who transferred to the new scheme from welfare payments other than smallholder's unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors which have an impact on the take-up of the scheme; notably, there is the significant increase in off-farm employment in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to enhance the effectiveness of the <Col N="1107" /> scheme, the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, which is currently before the House, provides for two key improvements to the scheme, to take effect from October of this year. The child-related income disregards are being increased in each case by £100 bringing them to £200 in respect of each of the first two children and to £300 in respect of the third and subsequent children. The means assessment rate is being reduced from 80% to 70%. I should mention that claimants of farm assist will also benefit from the improved capital assessment regime which is also being introduced in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000. These measures, as well as enhancing the level of support provided to existing claimants, will also increase the attractiveness of the scheme more generally to other low-income farmers.</P>
    <P>More generally, the farm assist scheme has been advertised in the national media and in the specialist farming publications. Also, the farming organisations notified their members through a series of country-wide seminars. My Department continues to liaise with these organisations on all aspects of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The network of social welfare offices throughout the country, currently provides information to members of the public on the range of schemes and services available, including the farm assist scheme. Information leaflets and application forms for farm assist are available at these offices. In addition, social welfare inspectors in rural areas promote the farm assist scheme when meeting the public in the course of their duties.</P>

      <P>Operational responsibility for the delivery of the community employment, programme on a regional basis is a matter for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act, 1987. I do not have any plans for changing the new three year limit on participation in the community employment programme which is considered essential to address the previously identified pattern of repeated participation on the programme, rather than it being used as an active labour market measure encouraging transition to employment in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the three year cap does not come into effect until April 2000 and that an individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account. Therefore, long-term unemployed persons who have previously participated in the programme can avail of another period of up to three years subject to the overall number of places available. Offshore island residents are exempt from the three year cap on participation in CE.</P>

      <P>Biodiversity refers to the range and variety of species which inhabit an ecosystem. It is my policy to achieve a balance between protection of the environment and other benefits such as rural development, employment and economic advancement. The concept of sustainable forest management is the stewardship of forests to meet the economic, environmental and social needs of today while not compromising the needs of future generations.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector in Ireland, the objective is to increase with due regard to site suitability and the attainment of the identified critical mass, the diversity of species in Irish forests, in order to achieve better timber quality, to extend the range of potential end-users, to reduce monocultures, for environmental and landscape purposes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the target of 20% will make a significant contribution to an increase in Ireland's biodiversity. I also propose to introduce a native woodland scheme to enhance and increase the size of the native-semi-native woodland estate. This should further enhance biodiversity.</P>

    <P>In the east Offaly research project, which commenced in 1989, the number of bovine reactors disclosed at tuberculin tests dropped from 362 in 1989 to 30 in 1995, a reduction of 92%. Since 1995, the level of reactor removal has continued to remain low in the project area and the incidence of the disease is amongst the lowest in the country.  Analysis of bovine disease data in the other four badger project areas cannot be published until the five year period of these projects has elapsed.</P>

      <P>Evidence of the likely involvement of tuberculous infected badgers in the development of the disease in the cattle population in Ireland has been documented in a number of studies including those by O'Connor and O'Malley, 1989, and Dolan, 1993. Research on strain typing, Costello<i> et al </i>1998, also found that the same range and geographic distribution of strain types was found in the majority of cattle and badger isolates and that this suggests that transmission between these species is a factor in the epidemiology of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> infection in Ireland. Furthermore, the recent Krebs report in the UK on Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle and Badgers, 1997, stated that the sum of the evidence strongly supports the view that badgers are a cause of herd breakdown. The fore<Col N="1116" /> going is also supported by the evidence available from the east Offaly project.</P>
      <P>There are no current plans to have a badger eradication programme in Ireland. However, it is proposed to undertake further research in the area of wildlife infection to complement existing research work by taking a more proactive approach with a view to the removal of all sources of infection in the 20% of the country which yields some 50% of current TB reactors.</P>

    <P>The position in relation to TB is that significantly higher numbers of reactors were disclosed throughout the country in 1998 and 1999 than in the preceding years. However, it is important to note that the number of reactors disclosed in 1996 and 1997 were amongst the lowest in this ten year period. Coincidentally, there have also been higher numbers of TB reactors in Northern Ireland and in parts of Britain in 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>Veterinary experts in Ireland and the UK have not as yet established the precise reasons for the recent increased levels of disease but amongst the factors considered are the cyclical nature of the disease, higher cattle numbers, stocking density, poor weather conditions which may have made animals more susceptible to the disease, some fraud and infected wildlife.</P>

    <P>The foregoing expenditure figures represent the scheme expenditure for the years in question. Between 1970 and 1999, total receipts in respect of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes amounted to £390.3 million. resulting in a net cost to the Exchequer of £439.8 million.</P>
    <P>The receipts figure comprises £330.5 million from the bovine diseases levies regime, £29.2 million from the sale of reactors, no receipts in this regard after 1977 by which time the arrangements had changed and £30.6 million in EU contributions.</P>

      <P>Taking account of the way overpayment records are held it would not be possible to systematically extract statistics on cases where farmers with multiple herd numbers have had to repay moneys to my Department. To provide the precise information required by the Deputy, it would be necessary to manually examine all debts where money had been recovered to establish, initially, which recoveries related to payment issued under schemes administered by the beef unit and, then, to establish the reason the overpayment arose. However if information was required on specific cases such information would be readily provided.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid a grant of £1,979 on 4 December <Col N="1119" /> 1996 under the control of farm pollution scheme, 1994-99. The person is also an applicant under the dairy hygiene scheme, 1994-99. The application is being processed and a key document is awaited from the applicant, card c, to indicate that the investment works under this scheme have been completed. When this document is received at my Department's local office at Tuam, an inspection will be carried out to ensure that the works have been completed in accordance with the criteria and specifications of the scheme.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme referred to is the new slaughter premium 2000 scheme. Under this scheme a slaughter premium is payable, not only on heifers and cows but also on bulls and steers aged eight months and older, slaughtered in local abattoirs or licensed meat export premises within the EU or exported live to third countries in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The premium is payable to producers of bovine animals who are registered herdowners and who held the animals slaughtered or exported live to a third country for a minimum of two months and where those animals were slaughtered or exported live to a third country within a month of leaving the producer's herd.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that application forms are not required for animals slaughtered within the Republic of Ireland or exported live to third countries as information captured on the Department's database, the Cattle Movement Monitoring System, will assist in determining the eligibility of these animals for premium. Payment will issue automatically where these animals are deemed to have met all the requirements of the slaughter premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Application forms will be required only for ani<Col N="1120" /> mals exported for slaughter in another EU member state. These forms will be available shortly and a help sheet detailing the operation and terms and conditions of the slaughter premium 2000 scheme will issue to all registered herdowners.</P>
    <P>The premium payable on animals qualifying during 2000 will amount to £21.26, 27 euro. However, a national quota ceiling of 1.777 million rights will apply and should the number of animals qualifying for the slaughter premium in 2000 exceed this quota, all payments will be reduced accordingly. In accordance with Commission regulation, payments under this scheme will commence on 16 October 2000, at which time a 60% advance payment will be made. Payments will be made on a monthly basis after that date for that scheme year. A balancing payment will be made in 2001 as soon as the quota position is established.</P>
    <P>Beef breed heifers qualifying for the slaughter premium will qualify, subject to conditions, for a further top-up payment from the national envelope negotiated under Agenda 2000. It is estimated that the top-up will be worth about £18, 22.85 euro, per beef breed heifer qualifying for the slaughter premium 2000 which, when combined with the slaughter premium of £21.26, 27 euro will be worth an estimated £39.26, 49.85 euro, per qualifying beef breed heifer.</P>

Under category D, farmers with no livestock units will be allocated quota first, then continuing with those with one livestock unit and so on, until all the available quota is distributed.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 169 from Deputy Ring on this same topic which I answered yesterday. The position is again set out below.</P>
      <P>In the context of establishing a new national training fund, I announced in budget 2000 a reduction of 0.7% in employer class A and H contribution rates from April next. I have no further plans to change employer contribution rates for the year 2000-01.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, a reduced rate of employers' PRSI has applied in respect of lower earning employees. From 6 April next, a rate of 7.8% as compared to the standard rate of 11.3%, will apply subject to an earnings limit of £14,560 per annum. This lower rate will apply to over half of employees insurable at class A, full rate, PRSI, including those in the clothing and textile sector.</P>
      <P>In addition, the establishment from April of this year of a national training fund will have an important and beneficial impact in terms of maintaining national competitiveness. Moreover, there will be no additional financial imposition on employers as the introduction of a national training levy payable in respect of all class A and H employees at a rate of 0.7% on the same income base as Employers PRSI, is being matched by the above mentioned reduction of 0.7% in the current employers' PRSI contribution rates.</P>
      <P>Finally, it might be noted that there are several schemes of support for both employers and employees, to encourage the employment of long-term unemployed from the live register. Such schemes, including revenue job assist and the back to work allowance scheme, provide additional allowances and PRSI-free holidays to employers to further support the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market, an increasingly important objective given the supply constraints evident in some parts of the labour market.</P>

      <Quest>if he will investigate the findings of a new study on psychiatric in-patients' suicide which has revealed that short stay patients are at significantly greater risk, with a suicide rate almost 40 times higher than the general population, and discontinued individual care and poor design of observation units were some of the factors identified.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy, Suicide in Psychiatric In-patients in Ireland, by Eleanor Corcoran and Dermot Walsh, was published in the Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine. It noted that major changes have occurred in the delivery of mental health care in Ireland over the last 30 years, with large isolated mental hospitals being replaced by small psychiatric units in general hospitals and a network of community-based services. These general hospital units with open doors have a much higher concentration of potentially suicidal patients than was the case with the large locked institutions of the past, where such patients were often dispersed throughout the hospital. While the study found that short stay psychiatric in-patients were at a particularly high risk of suicide, it also noted that three quarters of those suicides studied, while technically in-patients, were on leave or otherwise absent from the hospital at the time of death. The authors also found that the number of suicides occurring in in-patient settings as a proportion of suicides in the general population is no greater now than at the end of the 19th century. They commented that this finding gave credence to the assumption that the move to community care which psychiatric services have undergone in the last 40 years has not contributed, of itself, to the increase in overall suicide rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study concluded that social factors which contribute to an increase in the suicide rate in the general population, that is, bereavement, physical illness, abuse and unemployment were also relevant to the increase in hospital in-patient suicides and that more effective and comprehensive services to meet the needs of those with severe mental illness, particularly young adults, were required. The results also emphasised the import<Col N="1130" /> ance of managing in-patients in a safe, secure environment.</P>
    <P>Each person presenting with a mental health problem to the health boards' mental health services is assessed and given a care plan. Support on an in-patient, if appropriate, and out-patient basis is provided to all referrals of patients with suicidal ideation. Those who are chronically suicidal are closely monitored by the mental health multidisciplinary team in liaison with the person's general practitioner. Active intervention takes place when crises occur.</P>
    <P>In line with national policy, acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals continue to be developed to replace large institutional style psychiatric hospitals. The design of these new acute in-patient units is much improved and provides for monitoring of patients in need of close observation. There are now seventeen acute units attached to general hospitals throughout the country and at least a further twelve are planned.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the final report of the National Task Force on Suicide, health boards have been evaluating their services, particularly their prevention and treatment services, with a view to making them more accessible to vulnerable groups such as young males. Additional funding of £1 million has been provided this year by my Department towards the funding of a variety of initiatives by health boards in combating suicide.</P>

      <P>There is no delay in providing the facility for cardiac surgery at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, which is the national paediatric cardiac centre. A design team has been appointed and the detailed design of the theatre development is advancing on schedule. When complete, the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. It is expected that when these theatres are fully commissioned the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures, which is a 40% increase on existing capacity.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, as an interim measure, my Department is funding the purchase of cardiac surgery procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals under the cardiac waiting list initiative, and in this regard £700,000 was allocated to the Our Lady's Hospital in 2000 to continue this initiative.</P>
      <P>As at the 31 January 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, there was a total of 96 public patients awaiting cardiac surgery procedures in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. Of these 96 public patients, 14 are waiting up to three months, 19 are waiting between three and six months, and 63 are over six months.</P>
      <P>The paediatric cardiology/cardiac surgery services are under constant review by my Department and the authorities at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and I am confident that, when complete, the new theatre development at the hospital will be a significant factor in enhancing these services.</P>

      <P>The following respite services are available for children with special needs in County Meath.</P>
      <P>Under the break away scheme host families are recruited and trained to provide children with regular breaks. There are 25 children with host families in County Meath and breaks vary from one week per month to one week per year. The home care assistance scheme is designed to offer either the child or the family support within the home. An assistant is recruited and trained in conjunction with the family and a number of hours home care assistance is approved. The number of hours varies from six to 20 depending on the individual needs of both the children and their families. There are 19 families with children with special needs who are in receipt of home care assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of summer camps are organised during the summer for children with special needs. The camps, which are organised in consultation with the parents, have a therapy focus in addition to providing fun breaks for the children. They are facilitated by the North-Eastern Health Board's multidisciplinary staff and involve speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nursing and other care staff. In 1999, 40 children participated for a minimum period of one week per child in the summer camps. A total of 20 attended on a residential <Col N="1134" /> basis, with the remainder attending on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The board also provide financial assistance to St. Mary's special school towards the cost of organising their summer camp.</P>
    <P>Residential respite care is provided by the board at Avalon House and Coill Darach in Navan. There are three respite beds available but these are shared with adults and respite breaks are planned to take account of priority needs. Currently, 20 children currently avail of respite in both residences.</P>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £376,000, full year costs, has been allocated to the North-Eastern Health Board in 2000 to provide around 14 new respite care places for both adults and children with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
    <P>It is the board's intention to open a dedicated respite care facility in 2000 to further enhance the level of respite care available to both children and adults with special needs in County Meath. Both the home assistance and the break away scheme will be further developed, as will summer camps to meet the needs of specific disability groups such as those with an intellectual disability, autism or spina bifida.</P>
    <P>I have asked the board to provide me with the relevant information in relation to the number of children with special needs in County Meath who require respite care and will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The public private mix in public hospitals is under continual assessment by my Department to ensure that the best possible service is available to all patients but particularly the public patient. This assessment includes monitoring of the bed designation system whereby the approval of the Minister for Health and Children must be obtained by public agencies for any increase in the designation. In this regard the percentage of private beds in the public acute hospital system has remained at about 20% since the designation system began in 1993. In addition, my Department has commissioned a study by the Economic and Social Research Institute, to review the operation of the designation system and that report is expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It remains the Government's clear objective to deliver a quality hospital service to all patients but particularly to the public patient. I am very aware that the issue of access to services for those <Col N="1136" /> who are not deemed to be an emergency or in immediate need of care remains a focus of considerable dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>I have already publicly expressed my dissatisfaction with the waiting list figures for the end December 1999 period. I realise that the 36,855 people on public hospital waiting lists represent less than one twentieth of the total numbers who are admitted annually for treatment in the hospital system. Yet, it is a matter of genuine concern that many people, have to endure lengthy waits for access to elective procedures.</P>
    <P>While there is no one simple solution to this problem, the key task, in my view, is to manage the different parts of the system in a more closely integrated manner. This integrated approach to the problem underpinned the recommendations of the expert review group on waiting lists which reported in 1998. That report set out a series of short, medium and longer term measures that are directed at addressing the underlying causes of the problem.</P>
    <P>I intend to drive the implementation of those recommendations with an even greater urgency, with the emphasis being on achieving reductions in average waiting times rather than the less meaningful measure of overall numbers waiting. Progress made to date is currently being reviewed and where necessary I will be seeking to accelerate the introduction of the required measures, through direct communication with the chief executive officers.</P>
    <P>In addition, step-down, rehabilitation, long stay and community facilities all need to be developed to alleviate pressures on the acute system. The availability of £1 billion for infrastructural developments in the non-acute sector under the NDP will allow us to make major progress on this front.</P>
    <P>This is in addition to the £1 billion NDP investment in the hospital sector from which public patients, who take up 80% of our bed capacity, will benefit very significantly. In addition, the bed capacity of the acute sector itself needs to be reviewed against a background of population growth and other demographic changes. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains an explicit commitment to do this and I will be immediately actioning that.</P>
    <P>With the above approach, focusing on immediate practical steps as well as long-term measures, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying factors affecting access to certain services. The public patient will benefit significantly from the initiatives and investment described above and I am convinced that the health and social gain for all persons in the public health system will be very much enhanced.</P>

A sum of £6.85 million has been provided to the Western Health Board since 1998 to enable the full commissioning of new units, including the new operating theatres, completed under the major phase 1 development at the hospital. I understand from the board that all theatres have now been commissioned but due to a lack of anaesthetic and nursing personnel are not yet being used to full capacity. However, I understand that interviews have taken place and the board are now in the process of making the necessary appointments to enable full utilisation in line with the funding now available.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to be definitive as to the total nursing complement required to provide adequate staffing for hospitals. The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues <Col N="1138" /> was also highlighted in the Commission on Nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. It has been agreed that these issues will be addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. This committee is in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>The most recent survey of nursing vacancies was carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, and related to the position at 30 September 1999. This was the most comprehensive report to date and covered all agencies and nursing disciplines. The results confirmed again that there is not a nation-wide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the level of applicants for nursing posts outside the Dublin area far exceeds the number of positions available. The Western Health Board reported no vacancies in its area.</P>

      <P>Under the casemix budgeting system which is part of the resource allocation process for the acute hospital sector, a negative casemix adjustment of £216,559 was applied to the hospital referred to by the Deputy, based on the casemix performance of the hospital in question relative to other hospitals which participate in the casemix system.</P>
      <P>The casemix system uses clinical information which is directly derived from clinical practice and provided by the participating hospitals to determine a proportion of the funding for hospitals. Casemix classifies patients into discrete classes or groups, which share common clinical attributes and similar patterns of resource use, thus facilitating the use of such information for comparative purposes. All funding allocated under casemix remains within the hospital system and any funding deducted from hospitals is distributed to the other hospitals on the basis of their positive performance under casemix. Full details of the clinical and financial information on which casemix budget adjustments are based is provided to all hospitals to allow the agencies concerned to address the issues raised by a negative casemix adjustment.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers, to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. Details of the information requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table.</P>

      <P>Arrangements under EU regulations supersede the provisions of the Irish eligibility system in respect of certain categories of nationals of other EU states. Where this arises health boards are obliged to provide health services, on the same basis as to medical card holders, to these people on behalf of their home State, which retains responsibility for the costs involved in the provision of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, pensioners in receipt of social security pensions from other EU states who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, who are not covered by an Irish social welfare pension, as <Col N="1140" /> recipient or dependant, and who are not employed or self-employed here, are entitled to receive health services free of charge and are normally issued with a medical card.</P>

      <P>My Department does not routinely collect information in relation to numbers of cancelled elective procedures. The level of elective activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. This forms a central part of the service planning process which is required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unpredictable nature of activity generated by emergency admissions means that cancellations of elective procedures are inevitable from time to time as the system tries to cope with unexpected peaks. As part of the service planning process, it is a matter for agencies to attempt to take account of these peaks and troughs when planning their elective activity levels over a 12 month period. It is important that cancellations of elective procedures are viewed, therefore, in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans for the twelve month period. In this context, it should be noted that the total number of dis<Col N="1141" /> charges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals for the first ten months of 1999 was 689,644 which was about 2.5% of an increase on the figure of 673,015 for the same period in 1998.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body with responsibility to regulate the number and type of consultant appointments in hospitals providing services under the Health Act, 1970. The following data are extracted from the recently <Col N="1143" /> published Comhairle na nOspidéal report entitled Consulting Staffing &ndash; 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>The consultant establishment at 1 January 2000 in the public sector was 1,440 comprising 1,250 permanent consultants in practice, 147 vacant approved posts which were in the process of being filled on a permanent basis, six posts under consideration by Comhairle na nOspidéal and 37 unprocessed posts. Consultant posts are classified as vacant by Comhairle na nOspidéal until an appointee takes up duty on a permanent basis. In most cases posts are filled in a temporary capacity pending the submission of an application for the replacement post by the employing authority and the making of a permanent appointment through the usual selection procedures. Of the 127 non-permanent consultant appointments approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal on 31 December 1999, 88 related to approved vacant permanent posts in the process of being filled, 21 were acting as locums for permanent consultants on leave, 18 were additional temporary appointments associated mainly with the waiting list initiative. The data supplied are for non-permanent consultant posts.</P>

      <P>The report of the materials management advisory group, May 1996, stated that significant savings could be achieved within the health sector by modernising the materials management function. Since the report, a healthcare materials management board has been established together with a reorganisation of structures, including the appointment of regional materials managers in each of the health board and health authority areas to ensure that the strategies outlined in the <Col N="1144" /> report are implemented in the most practical and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>A targeted national plan for savings, including performance indicators for purchasing and inventory management, is currently being finalised by the HMMB in conjunction with the regional materials managers. This plan is designed to ensure that the required savings targets are achieved, co-operation is maximised and best practice prevails. I believe that with the appropriate co-operation between the health agencies in quickly putting this plan into action these savings will not impact negatively on the quality of the health service.</P>

      <P>The recently published immunisation guidelines for Ireland, prepared by the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, contain detailed advice for doctors in relation to the use of existing meningitis vaccines. They indicate that routine immunisation with the currently available meningococcal C vaccine is not recommended. However, this vaccine is recommended for use, where indicated, in outbreaks of group C meningococcal disease. They also note that group B organisms, against which there is no vaccine available, are the major cause <Col N="1145" /> of meningococcal disease in Ireland and that a considerable number of cases from group C organisms occur in children too young to be protected with presently available vaccines.</P>
      <P>The guidelines note that it is expected that conjugate group C vaccines will become available in the near future and that these are effective and safe in those under two years of age. I anticipate that the committee will review its advice in relation to immunisation against meningitis when the first group C vaccine is licensed for use in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The choice of drugs or medicines prescribed for <Col N="1146" /> each patient is ultimately the prerogative of the doctor concerned having regard to the individual requirements of the patient being treated. However, in exercising this prerogative it is important for doctors to also have regard to any economies that are possible from rational prescribing which do not have a detrimental effect on patient care.</P>
      <P>The issue of controlling the steadily rising costs of prescribing is common to most developed countries, particularly those where a substantial portion of the cost is borne by the State. In Ireland, given that the vast bulk of prescribing is done in the primary care sector, the State &ndash;  similar to Britain and for the same reasons &ndash; has to date concentrated on that sector to control medicines and drugs costs. The introduction of the indicative drugs target savings scheme in 1993 to the GMS scheme has proved successful in controlling the increase in drugs costs and has been responsible for a confirmed higher rate of generic substitution by doctors.</P>
      <P>An agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation is in place to ensure a continuation of the IDTSS scheme and to allow the introduction of more cost effective prescribing under the community drugs schemes which will include a switch to less expensive medicines, including generics.</P>
      <P>Control of drugs and medicines costs is not, however, just about generics. Accordingly, I should point out too there is also an agreement between my Department and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association on a number of matters including the price of medicines supplied to the health services. It covers all drugs and medicines prescribable and re-imbursable in the GMS scheme community drugs schemes and all drugs and medicines supplied to hospitals and health boards.</P>
      <P>Another important aspect of the process of ensuring value for money in respect of drugs and medicines was the establishment of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics whose primary purpose is to establish expertise in Ireland for the advancement of pharmacoeconomics through education, practice and research and facilitate an optimal &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; approach in relation to drugs use. The centre provides an ongoing facility for my Department in the evaluation of new therapies and an analysis of the supply and use of medicines. It will also develop guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry on the appropriate methodology to be followed in the economic evaluation of drug therapies. In addition, the centre provides, <i>inter alia,</i> an annual commentary and analysis on GMS and non-GMS prescribing; and advice to the Department, in an early warning sense, of pending new therapies either in development or already available elsewhere particularly where these may have a significant economic impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of the above, the crucial matter remains proper patient treatment but with regard to the need to ensure that prescribing is effective, rational and economic. I am satisfied that these <Col N="1147" /> measures represent an appropriate strategy to controlling drugs costs in the best interests of patients and the State.</P>

      <P>As part of its ongoing objective of maintaining internationally accepted standards of safety in relation to blood components, the Blood Transfusion Service Board decided to introduce PCR testing of all blood donations. As it will not be in a position to introduce this test at its new headquarters until 2001, the BTSB decided that it would, in the meantime, contract with another transfusion centre to perform the test on its behalf.</P>
      <P>In August 1999, the BTSB advised my Department that it was finalising an agreement with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) to perform PCR testing of donations on its behalf. The SNBTS sought confirmation that the State indemnity in respect of the BTSB's product liability would apply to the agreement between it and the BTSB. By way of background information, the Government in July 1996 decided that the State would carry its own indemnity in respect of the BTSB's product liability.</P>
      <P>My Department sought detailed clarification from the BTSB in relation to the specific requirements of the SNBTS and subsequently sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in the matter. On 8 October 1999 the Office of the Attorney General advised that the State indemnity did not extend to the proposed agreement with the SNBTS. On 11 October the Government approved a proposal from the then Minister to extend the existing State indemnity to the agreement with SNBTS. On 18 October my Department advised the BTSB of the extension of the indemnity in terms approved by the Office of Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The BTSB entered into an agreement with the SNBTS with effect from 1 November 1999. Since that date a sample of every blood donation collected in the State is being sent to the SNBTS for PCR testing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to a question from the Deputy on 8 February 2000 I outlined the position in relation to the licensing requirements of the Irish Medicines Board relevant to the facilities at the Cork centre of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. In October 1997 the IMB specified as a condition of the manufacturer's licence that the components laboratory at the Cork centre should be upgraded or replaced; the IMB did not seek the provision of a new Cork centre. It is a matter for the BTSB to determine how best to meet regulatory requirements in a manner acceptable to the IMB. My Department made available during 1998 and 1999 capital grants totalling £524,000 to the BTSB to enable it provide a new components processing laboratory and other improvements at the centre. In the light of these developments, the IMB advised the BTSB last December that the replacement of the components processing laboratory at the Cork centre was no longer considered necessary. The IMB has deleted the special condition specified in the licence to which I have referred and has not specified any other condition which relates to capital projects at the centre. In the light of the factual position I have outlined, my Department has not questioned the decision of the IMB which is the independent regulator in these matters.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the IMB's decision, the BTSB considers that further capital investment in the Cork centre is desirable and has approved an outline planning brief in this regard. A more detailed planning brief is now being prepared and a project team has been established within the BTSB. As the Cork centre is located on the campus of St. Finbarr's Hospital, the BTSB has written to the Southern Health Board seeking discussions in relation to its leasehold interest in the site.</P>
      <P>My Department will consider any application from the BTSB for further capital investment in the Cork centre as a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy, A Comparison of Suicide in Two Irish Counties by John Connolly, Anne Cullen, Dermot Walsh, Sheila McGauran and Darra Phelan, was published in the <i>Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine</i> in December 1999. It set out to determine to what extent official suicide rates in counties Kildare and Mayo underestimated the rates as clinically determined, and to examine and compare the association between the socio-demographic characteristics of the two Irish counties and trends in the suicide rates.</P>
      <P>The results of the study showed that neither county presented a significant change in suicide mortality over time from 1988 to 1994. It found that Kildare males were more likely to choose hanging or shooting as a method of suicide than their counterparts in Mayo. The authors pointed to the increased availability of firearms in Kildare, due to the presence of a large military establishment, as to the possible reason for this choice and means of committing suicide. It also showed that in Mayo the commonest method of suicide for both sexes was drowning, reflecting tradition and access to means. Mayo is a coastal county with many rivers and lakes. The study concluded that detailed local research was needed before implementing suicide prevention programmes due to the many demographic differences and differences in traditions and choice of method of suicide that existed between counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of firearms in suicides was considered by the national task force on suicide, which noted in its report that firearms account for a relatively small percentage of suicides in the country as a whole. The task force recommended that all applications for firearms licences be carefully scrutinised and I understand that this issue is being addressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Commenting on their findings regarding County Kildare, the authors of this study noted that the availability of legally held firearms is very strictly controlled in Ireland <Col N="1150" /> and they took the view that further restriction was unlikely to have any impact on the suicide rates.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the final report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy has commenced with a partnership approach being adopted between statutory and non-statutory services. Central to the strategy has been the establishment of a suicide research group by the health boards to conduct research and advise health boards on measures to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide. Health boards have also appointed resource officers and have established multi-disciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</P>

      <P>The Water Pollution Acts include a general prohibition on entry of polluting matters to waters; powers for local authorities to require measures to be taken to prevent water pollution, and to prevent and abate pollution themselves in certain circumstances; and a requirement that as soon as practicable after the occurrence of an accidental discharge, spillage or deposit of any polluting matter which enters or is likely to enter any waters or a sewer, the person responsible must notify the local authority in whose functional area the discharge, spillage or deposit occurs. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes an offence which is liable to a fine on summary prosecution by the local authority.</P>

In the event, the R624 road realignment project was not among the 12 projects totalling £3,005,203 which were selected from the Cork County Council submission for advancement in 2000 under this scheme.</P>

      <P>In the case of persons in receipt of disability allowance regulations provide for a specific income disregard for means test purposes in respect of rehabilitative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an employment has been certified by the national rehabilitation board or by the person's own doctor as being rehabilitative in nature, and has been accepted as such by my Department a person in receipt of disability allowance is allowed to earn up to £50.00 net per week without their disability allowance entitlement being affected. Income is calculated on the average of net income over a six week period. Such income is confirmed by my Department with the <Col N="1153" /> employer concerned. Any income in excess of this amount is assessable as means.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the important role social welfare income support plays, and in particular, the consequences that taking up rehabilitative employment can have on people's disability allowance entitlement. In this regard, significant progress has been made in recent years in relation to this disregard. In particular, the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, provides for a further significant increase, from £50 to £75 per week with effect from 5 April 2000, in the amount of income from rehabilitative employment which can be disregarded for means test purposes.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of a specific case where difficulties have arisen, my Department will be happy to discuss the matter with her.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. Payments to asylum seekers are made on the same basis as payments to other recipients.</P>
      <P>SWA basic payments are currently being made to approximately 6,940 households in respect of 8,675 adults and 2,620 children who are asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on SWA payments to asylum seekers in 1999 is estimated at £35 million. Total expenditure in 1998 was £22 million and £12 million in 1997. The information requested by the Deputy is not available in relation to earlier years. Prior to 1997, asylum seekers were not identified separately from other SWA applicants but as there were fewer asylum seekers at that time, expenditure would have been lower.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the <Col N="1154" /> health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance provides a basic weekly allowance as a right to eligible people who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs must be carried out to determine entitlement to benefits. Where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>Payments can also be made where a person has no means to meet their immediate needs pending payment from another source, for example, where they are awaiting determination of an application for a social welfare or health board payment. Any interim payment which is awarded pending the determination or payment of a social welfare or health board payment is fully recoverable from the arrears once the other payment is awarded.</P>
      <P>People with low incomes may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, for example, rent and mortgage interest payments, or a payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
      <P>If it subsequently transpires that the information given to the community welfare officer is incorrect then the matter will be reviewed with the purpose of recovering any overpayment involved. Where there is evidence of fraudulent claims the matter will be forwarded to the Garda for investigation.</P>

      <P>Detection of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department. Some 600 staff work at local, regional and national level, either full-time or part-time on the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. The total savings which resulted from their activities amounted to some £192 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>Details of overpayments arising from fraud or suspected fraud, in respect of the year 1999 are not yet complete. However, overpayments amounting to £11,320,896, representing 14,147 cases, have so far been recorded as being attributable to fraud or suspected fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of cases forwarded by my Department to the Chief State Solicitor's office for prosecution in 1999 was 338. At the end of 1999 a <Col N="1155" /> total of 470 cases were awaiting hearing in the courts.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions are taken against persons who defraud social welfare schemes, and also against employers who fail to honour their obligations under the PRSI system. All cases involving fraud or abuse of the social welfare system are examined with a view to initiating legal proceedings. This involves striking a balance between the need to vigorously pursue serious fraud and abuse, while at the same time having regard to the individual circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Amnesties were previously introduced, in 1991 and 1993, to encourage those involved in fraud and abuse to regularise their position. I have no plans to introduce a further amnesty at this time.</P>

      <P>A national child development study has never been carried out in this country. Such a study would be a major undertaking involving considerable cost. The Commission on the Family estimated that the resources necessary would be in the region of £0.8 &ndash; £1 million per survey round of the study, 1998 costs.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study will explore the issues involved in such a major undertaking. It will set out the scope, methodology and management arrangements which would be appropriate for a full national child development, longitudinal, study of children in Ireland, the estimated costs which would be involved and the options as regards funding. An authoritative report on these issues will be critical to the deliberations of officials and the Government in relation to the feasibility of undertaking the full study.</P>

      <P>There were 2,933 persons in custody in Irish Prisons on Monday 28 February 2000. As of the same date, the number of staff of all grades, including doctors, chaplains and staff cooks was 3,156. It should be noted that the current staffing includes a level of supernumerary officers who were recruited in the context of the need to staff the new prisons at Cloverhill and Portlaoise. These officers are receiving on-the-job experience prior to being reassigned.</P>

      <P>The most recent figure available for the average annual cost of keeping an offender in custody is £53,400. This figure was calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders over a certain period, in this case &ndash; 1998. The figure for 1999 is currently being worked on in my De partment and I will write to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>Committal statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. At present the compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually as there are no computerised systems in most prisons. This is an extremely time consuming and staff intensive process and it has not been possible to release staff for this work.</P>
      <P>A new £6 million information technology programme, authorised by me, for the Prison Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database will be deployed across the Prison Service later this year. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the latest year for which the information sought by the Deputy has been published, the total number of persons committed to prison for default of fines was 2,173. This represents 21% of the total number of offenders committed in 1994.</P>
      <P>The following figures, as yet unpublished, give details for 1995 and 1996. The figures are not yet available for later years.</P>

    <P>It is very important to note that, at no time, are more than 1.5% of prison spaces taken up by persons committed for non-payment of fines. The courts are moreover required to take ability to pay into account when imposing fines on persons convicted of offences attracting monetary penalties. Many persons committed to prison for non- payment of fines, who are perfectly capable of paying these penalties, only pay up when actually in custody or on the point of being put in custody.</P>

      <P>On 23 June 1998 a request under section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, for a copy of any data held concerning him was received from the individual in question by way of a third party request from his prospective employer. The individual had consented to the request. A reply outlining the convictions recorded against the individual was issued on 1 July 1998.</P>
      <P>The processing of the request in question arose from a practice which had developed whereby employers of prospective employees were, with the written consent of these employees, requesting the Garda for copies of personal data, namely details from the criminal records data base relating to any convictions recorded against the individuals concerned under section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988. I was informed by the Garda authorities that they were advised by the Data Protection Commissioner that the said section 4 did not provide for the disclosure of personal data to third parties, irrespective of whether the individuals in question had consented to allow the Garda to respond to the prospective employer and the Garda authorities, on the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner, ceased to do so. The Attorney General subsequently advised that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, was not designed for, and is not appropriate for, use as a vehicle for police clearance.</P>
      <P>The current position is that clearances are provided only in certain circumstances, for example, for persons seeking certain public service employment and for full-time prospective employees in the healthcare area who have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. The disclosure of any information in such cases is done strictly in accordance with legal advices received from Office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>The number of people on waiting lists and the waiting times for appointments with solicitors at each of the 30 full-time law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board at the end of January 2000 are set out in the following tabular statement. The board currently has sanction for 89 solicitors and 125 administrative staff employed in the law centres. The number of people on the waiting list on 31 January 2000 is 2,692. This figure, which includes people on wait<Col N="1161" /> ing lists at part-time law centres, compares with a figure of 2,944 at 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out, of course, that most people, whether availing of civil legal aid services or paying for the services of private practitioners would tend to experience some waiting period for legal services &ndash; either at the outset or in the course of a case. The important figures, therefore, in looking at this situation are not so much the overall number of clients who are listed as &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; but the average waiting period for a first appointment at each centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to combat the problems being experienced in relation to waiting times, I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board for this year when I increased the allocation of grant-in-aid to £12.899 million, an increase of 8% on the 1999 allocation. Where waiting times, for <Col N="1162" /> whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board is proceeding with the setting up of a nation-wide private practitioners panel to provide legal services in domestic violence, maintenance, and custody/access issues in the District Court. This scheme, while increasing the services provided by the board, should also enable the law centres to devote more resources to non-District Court matters and should help to reduce waiting times in law centres. I understand that advertisements were placed in the papers recently inviting private practitioners to put their names on a panel for this purpose and the scheme is at present being set up on a county by county basis.</P>

      <P>At national level, the management and funding of the network of community training workshops is a matter for FÁS. Responsibility for the day-to-day operation of individual workshops is a matter for the director and board of management of the particular centre.</P>
      <P>In respect of the 1999-2000 period, under arrangements for co-operation with other institutions, my Department approved an allocation of 960 hours for the provision of teaching services in the Tralee Community Training Workshop. Returns in respect of usage of hours in the workshop indicates that approximately 758 hours were used there in 1998-1999.</P>
      <P>The utilisation of hours approved by my Department under arrangements for co-operation with other institutions as between literacy/numeracy tuition, personal development, general and vocational education is a matter for determination at centre level, having regard to needs. In Tralee Community Training Workshop, it is understood that literacy and numeracy tuition is delivered under the title of communications skills and is also integrated into other modules such as life and social skills, personal development, health and hygiene-childcare, computer skills, catering, construction and craftwork. This approach has been approved by the centre's board of management and is being monitored to assess its effectiveness.</P>

      <P>The safety standards of vehicles used for school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Eireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. Bus Eireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. I should also mention that the age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Eireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
      <P>Bus Eireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Eireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Eireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999.</P>
      <P>A test for school transport vehicles is already in place. All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test. All school transport vehicles are also subject to regular inspection to ensure their reliability is maintained throughout the year.</P>
