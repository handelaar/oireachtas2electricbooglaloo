      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy with the arrangements apparently applying with regard to the release of the Provisional IRA members who were involved in the killing of Garda Jerry McCabe? Will he confirm that these prisoners are treated differently from other prisoners on the question of applying for compassionate leave, that the normal welfare officer examination that would apply to other life prisoners who committed other crimes is not applied to them and that they are released much more readily without checking than would be normal prisoners? Is there a political deal involving Sinn Féin to facilitate these prisoners being treated differently from other prisoners who have committed other equally serious offences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same matter, yesterday the Private Notice Question answered by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, was not clear about whether there was or was not a formal or informal agreement between representatives of the Government and representatives of Sinn Féin in respect of the extraordinary and unique, as far as we are concerned, parole arrangements for these people who were convicted of the manslaughter of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. The Minister of State was not in a position to give an authoritative answer. Will the Taoiseach confirm that there was such an agreement following negotiations with representatives of Sinn Féin on behalf of these Provisional IRA activists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the majority of the debate here yesterday during which the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, answered questions. I do not want to go over the hour long debate again other than to agree with what she said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was stated in the House in the past few months, four of the people in custody on charges arising in connection with the killing of Detective Garda McCabe have been granted short periods of compassionate parole over the past number of months. I reiterate that the applications for compassionate parole were considered in accordance <Col N="684" /> with the normal criteria which apply in such cases. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was satisfied in each case that the granting of a period of compassionate parole was justified. There were not any special arrangements or special conditions applying to that. All the releases were subject to standard conditions, such as keeping the peace and being of good behaviour.</P>
    <P>I understand that such releases can cause considerable distress to the family of the victim, but the granting of compassionate parole has long been a feature of prisons administration both here and elsewhere. Each case must be assessed on its merits. I have asked, particularly in this case &ndash; I understand from listening to the debate yesterday that the House would wish this &ndash; that in the case of the release of anyone connected with Detective Garda Jerry McCabe the family and the local gardaí should be informed. I am not sure that was clear yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not informed and they should have been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly reiterate what I and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have stated on many occasions, that the persons convicted in connection with the death of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe do not qualify for release under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. I have been asked several times to change from that position and to have a different arrangement, but I resisted and desisted from doing that and I will continue to do so. Attempts have been made to equate the short release on compassionate grounds of the persons in question with their early release under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. That is not the case. What was granted here was compassionate parole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of a different agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated yesterday, breaches of the conditions attached to compassionate parole in these cases were not reported to either the prison authorities or to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Any such reports would be fully investigated. I hope that fully answers the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach check the veracity of everything he has just said because some of the things he said are not true? Is it the case that there is no such thing in Irish law as compassionate parole? There is only temporary release under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. Is it the case that different arrangements in relation to escorting prisoners on temporary release under that section are applied to prisoners other than these prisoners? Is it the case <Col N="685" /> that the normal welfare officer examination of the alleged grounds for compassion did not occur in these cases in the same way as it would have occurred in other cases where, for example, medical certificates from general practitioners given in respect of relatives would be independently checked? Were those medical certificates independently checked in these cases?</P>
      <P>Could I have a clear assurance that henceforth the rules under section 2 of the 1960 Act will be applied in exactly the same way to these prisoners as to any other prisoners who commit offences of equivalent seriousness? This must be done on the basis of rules, not individual discretion. We must remember we are talking about the killing of a member of the Garda Síochána, not about a minor offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to get to my feet again but I must restate my question. Perhaps the Taoiseach in his prepared reply did not have a response for it. I want clarification from the Taoiseach arising from the statements made yesterday by the Minister of State. Were there discussions with representatives of Sinn Féin and, if so, what was the nature of those discussions? Was a deal done in respect of this release?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear to Deputy Quinn that that is not the case. Sinn Féin has raised the case of these individuals a number of times. Its argument is that they should apply under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. However, the Government's decision is they do not. I have reiterated that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not any special conditions. I have been asked many times and I have refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am clear about what the Taoiseach just said, which was said repeatedly by the Minister of State yesterday under pressure. However, were there specific negotiations about temporary release, not about whether they are encompassed by the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there is temporary release or compassionate parole, which is the term used by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this and a number of cases, I did not have any discussions or I am not aware of any discussions. It was not raised. What Sinn Féin has raised in this regard is clear. It believes these individuals should be out under the Good Friday Agreement. We do not share that view and that should be quite clear.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton asked a number of detailed questions. They were asked in the House yesterday and the Minister of State, who is briefed on those matters in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, answered them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach help the House by publishing the rules which apply in this case under section 2 of the 1960 Act? It is important to make the point that this is not a discretion. There are rules which must apply. Will the Taoiseach make available to me a copy of the rules giving a clear indication as to the procedures in relation to checking for any application for temporary release? Many suggestions are being made which clearly indicate these prisoners are being treated differently from other prisoners. I hope the Taoiseach will carefully check what he said in the House because it would be serious for him and for the House if he was not accurate in his answers on this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me on the Order of Business. On 11 October, following fairly heated exchanges in this House, a compromise was arrived at whereby a statement was issued by the party leaders in respect of the obligations of all citizens generally, and in particular Members of the Oireachtas, to comply fully with the operation of tribunals established by this House. The text is available but I am precluded from reading it on the Order of Business. Is the Taoiseach prepared to amend the Order of Business to incorporate by way of a motion to be taken without debate, since the text has already been extensively negotiated and arrived at, and that this House would affirm, by way of motion, what we stated by way of joint statement by party leaders on 11 October before we adjourn tonight? To facilitate the House I will read the statement again as follows:</P>
      <P>The Flood Tribunal was established by the unanimous will of the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>Every citizen and, even more so, every Member of the Oireachtas owes a legal, moral and democratic duty to co-operate with the Tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders.</P>
      <P>We would expect any citizen and any member of the Oireachtas who disputed the validity or legality of any Tribunal order to make his or her case to the Tribunal and, if necessary, to the Courts.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Taoiseach on behalf of all of us in this House to put this by way of motion to be taken without debate in light of what is happening, and has happened over the last 24 hours. This does not impact on the reputation of just any one individual in this House, it impacts on the reputation of all of us.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>(i) notes that the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland has announced its intention to make an offer for ICC Bank plc which values ICC Bank at IR£275 million,</P>
      <P>(ii) approves, pursuant to Section 4 of the ICC Bank Act, 2000, the disposal of the Minister's shares to bank of Scotland subject to the terms of the offer, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii) approves that, pursuant to the irrevocable undertaking to be given by the Minister to Bank of Scotland subject to the terms of the offer, the Minister reserves his right to accept a better competing offer made on or before 16 January 2001 which must be at <Col N="694" /> least 10% higher than Bank of Scotland's offer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bank of Scotland recently announced its intention to make an offer under Irish Take-over Panel Rules for ICC Bank plc. Under section 4 (2) of the ICC Bank Act, 2000, I am required to obtain a motion of approval from the House prior to disposing of any shares in ICC Bank. As Deputies will be aware, a copy of the pre-offer document has been circulated to all Members of the House. I will refer to the details of the pre-conditional recommended offer later.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate ICC Bank on its achievements over the past 67 years. ICC was set up in 1933 as a channel to provide finance for the establishment of native industry. At that time, of course, the financial sector in general was very poorly developed. As Irish industry has grown, so has ICC Bank as it steadily expanded its range of services and the type of business it financed. This has now broadened to a full range of financial services to many businesses. Sectors served by the bank now include transport, software, tourism, distribution and a wide range of service sectors as well as manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The 1980s saw the introduction of additional trade products and the expansion of the bank's commercial loan portfolio and treasury services, including foreign exchange services. ICC equity investment activity was also expanded by direct investment and by the establishment and management of venture capital funds. Venture capital is a major part of its core business and it is one of the leading providers of venture capital in Ireland.</P>
    <P>ICC Bank has always worked closely over the years with the Minister for Finance of the day. Successive Ministers have had an excellent working relationship with the board and the staff and I take this opportunity to thank all the members of the board of directors and the staff of ICC Bank down through the years for their commitment and hard work, all of which culminated in making ICC the successful bank it is today. The bank is highly professional, successful and operates to very high standards.</P>
    <P>It is impressive to note that since its beginning ICC Bank has made a profit in each year of its operation and that this year will mark a further significant improvement. While the State has made equity investments totalling £36.9 million over the years, the bank has grown through retained profits and deposits and loans to a stage where its balance sheet now amounts to over £2.8 billion. The most recent interim results show pre-tax profits up by 64% to £18.3 million and the cost to income ratio reduced to 35.8% from 47.1 % for the same period last year.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the climate in which ICC operates has evolved dramatically since its early days. There is now significantly more competition from the private sector in the areas in which the bank specialises and a considerable increase in the levels of expertise and particularly <Col N="695" /> risk management required in banking generally. The board concluded, with my support, that the company's future would be best served by a change of ownership.</P>
    <P>The Government made a decision in principle in mid-1998 in favour of disposing of the State's interest in ICC Bank. Following this decision, a sale process was initiated in 1999 and we all know that the outcome was unsatisfactory &ndash; mainly because of the general decline in the valuation of financial stocks at that time. I suspended the sale process temporarily in December of last year, but I asked the board to review all options for the future and reiterated my view that the current <i>status quo</i> was not an option. Earlier this year, I authorised the board to explore the options for a change in ownership. This process led to the bid by Bank of Scotland.</P>
    <P>The board recommended my acceptance of the pre-conditional offer announced by Bank of Scotland for ICC Bank on 5 December, which values ICC at £275 million. My advisers have also indicated to me that the offer represents fair value. The offer was made by Bank of Scotland subject to Dáil Éireann passing this motion of approval for the disposal of my shares and receiving an irrevocable undertaking from me to accept its offer for ICC Bank.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to give this irrevocable undertaking but retain the right to consider a bid, by 16 January 2001, provided it is 10% higher than Bank of Scotland's offer. The board of ICC Bank has advised me to accept this offer as the price Bank of Scotland is offering represents a significant premium on the price offered last year. I have also received advice from my financial advisers, ABN AMRO, that it is appropriate for me, as shareholder, to enter into the irrevocable undertaking proposed by Bank of Scotland. The offer is being made under the Irish take-over panel rules which means that the offer is fully binding, provided the conditions set out in the offer document are satisfied.</P>
    <P>The irrevocable undertaking will be in respect of the approximately 85% of ICC's issued share capital owned by me. This excludes the ICC shares to be transferred to the employee share ownership plan. On a small technical point, a special dividend was approved at an ICC EGM on 1 December 2000. It will be paid to ICC minority shareholders who hold approximately 1,650 shares, provided the offer is declared wholly unconditional and I am satisfied that the interests of this very small block of shareholders are fully protected.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent opportunity for the expertise in the ICC Bank to develop further under the umbrella of a much larger group. Bank of Scotland is a diversified financial services group engaged in a range of banking, insurance broking, financial services and finance related activities throughout the United Kingdom and internationally. We are all aware of the impact the bank made when it became involved in the mort<Col N="696" /> gage market here in Ireland. In that case, keenly priced mortgages offered by Bank of Scotland played an important part in the reduction of margins on mortgage rates generally. The Irish commercial banking market is considered by Bank of Scotland to be attractive, not only because of the growth of the Irish economy but also because there is real opportunity to offer vigorous competition in the market.</P>
    <P>Bank of Scotland's financial strength and standing is a significantly positive aspect of the offer. Given the structure of funding of ICC Bank's deposits and borrowings, it is important that any purchaser should be of sufficient financial standing and strength to secure the current and future funding of the bank. I am glad to say Bank of Scotland has such a standing.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that over the years various State guarantees have been given in relation to deposits placed with ICC Bank. For some time there has been a policy in place of limiting and reducing the level of guarantees provided and those outstanding in ICC's case are only a small fraction of their overall funds. The level of guarantees will be actively reduced as facilities mature and alternative facilities are made available. Meanwhile, Bank of Scotland is providing a counter indemnity in respect of the capital on outstanding funds that are State guaranteed. Given the continuing, though reducing, guarantee which the State will be providing on some of ICC Bank's funding pending maturity, it is important that the party giving the State a counter indemnity covering such guarantees is of appropriate quality and strength. Again, Bank of Scotland provides such financial strengths.</P>
    <P>The purchase of ICC Bank by Bank of Scotland should significantly improve career opportunities within the bank for the employees of ICC.</P>
    <P>The ESOP agreed between management and staff of ICC will also be honoured by Bank of Scotland. The terms of the offer envisage that the ESOT shares in ICC will be swapped for Bank of Scotland shares. This is in line with the terms set out in the transformation and flexibility agreement. In return for a 5% stake in ICC, the staff have agreed to: increasing the hours in the working week; outsourcing of services; an open-ended option to reduce staff numbers on a voluntary basis; transfers within the bank; changes in duties; closer linking of performance and reward; no cost increasing claims to be submitted for a period of three years; and continuation of staff flexibility.</P>
    <P>Another element in the ESOP was the purchase of 9.9% of the shares in ICC for £19.8 million, funded through increased pension contributions, borrowings, dividends and a 5% profit share arrangement subject to a cumulative limit of £6 million.</P>
    <P>Based on the value of the offer now made by Bank of Scotland of £275 million, the 5% element which relates to the transformation of ICC would be worth about £40,000 to each staff member. Based on the offer price, the staff would, having <Col N="697" /> purchased the 9.9% stake for £19.8 million, get a futher benefit amounting to an average of £20,000 per employee. It is likely to be at least four years before staff receive any benefit, with the benefit being distributed over the following ten years or more.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of ICC Bank will provide Bank of Scotland with a significant boost to its existing commercial banking operations in Ireland. Bank of Scotland's existing commercial businesses in Ireland are principally focused on the small and medium sized business sector and this is precisely the focus of ICC Bank's operations. Over nearly 70 years, ICC Bank has built up a strong presence in this sector and has earned a reputation for integrity, efficiency and customer service. Bank of Scotland intends to develop these businesses, focused on the SME sector. Accordingly, as advised by the board of ICC Bank, the proposed acquisition should contribute to the development of the company which would enable an expanded and improved range of services to be provided to its customers.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe this is a very favourable offer with obvious advantages for both banks and I am hopeful it will increase competition in the Irish banking sector.</P>
    <P>I say a very special thank you to the current board of ICC Bank under the chairmanship of Philip Flynn, as well as its management and all the employees who have contributed to making the bank the profitable and attractive institution it is today and for bringing this excellent proposal for a change in ownership to me.</P>
    <P>Under the takeover panel rules and the terms of the offer, other bidders will have until the middle of January to submit offers to me, through the board. The motion before the House is for the current bid only &ndash; one which I have agreed to accept. If the board recommends a higher bid to me and I contemplate acceptance, I will come back to the House with a new motion of approval.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer will receive £234 million from Bank of Scotland in respect of the 85% of shares that will be held by me when I accept the offer. The Exchequer will also receive a further £19.8 million from the ESOT in respect of the 9.9% stake in ICC that it is purchasing, bringing total receipts to the Exchequer to almost £254 million. I will be considering the appropriate use of these proceeds once they have been paid into the Central Fund and I will report back to the House at the appropriate time on this point.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ulick Burke and Seán Barrett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by Bank of Scotland that it is acquiring ICC Bank for a consideration of approximately £275 million. It has been the policy of the Fine Gael Party, for reasons which have been stated on several occasions, that ICC should be sold for the best price available. Changes in the banking industry have made it <Col N="698" /> very difficult for small banks, such as ICC, to continue to operate independently.</P>
    <P>I note the contribution ICC has made to the commercial life of Ireland over many years. The bank has approximately 3,000 loan customers, most of them in small and medium sized enterprises. It has helped to build up the industrial base of the country, particularly the indigenous industrial base. In more recent times the bank has been involved in venture capital advances and it has stakeholdings in about 100 companies, most of which are based in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When, just before Christmas last year, the Minister withdrew ICC from the market the price offered was significantly less than the price which has now been negotiated. That was a good decision and the arrangement now in place is more satisfactory than the one envisaged at that time. I wish the new venture every success. I appreciate it has not been finalised yet. The Minister has agreed that if a competitive bid 10% higher than the £275 million offered by the Bank of Scotland is made before 10 January, he will opt for the higher bid at that stage. Does the Minister envisage the possibility of a higher bid being made and being accepted or does he envisage a round of negotiations taking place, sparked off by the higher bid, which would change the value of the company?</P>
    <P>I welcome the arrangements for the employee share option scheme. It is important that such a scheme should be in place. The Bank of Scotland is, effectively, acquiring 85% of ICC and the remaining 15% will be owned by the employees of the company through an <i>ex gratia </i>grant of 5% of the shares and the purchase of 9.9%. That is satisfactory but I am unclear as to how employees will acquire the value of their shares. I presume they will be paid in Bank of Scotland shares, that there will be an exchange of Bank of Scotland shares for their shareholdings in ICC Bank and a market in Bank of Scotland shares as it is a quoted company. In light of this I do not understand why the Minister says it will not be possible for employees to obtain the value of their shares within four years. If someone retires from ICC Bank in the spring I do not understand why he or she will not be able to cash his or her shares or acquire their value on the market.</P>
    <P>In general I agree with this proposal. In any situation such as this there is always an element of making up one's mind that it is the best deal available. The other interested parties entered into negotiations with the Department of Finance at a very late stage. Decisions have to be made and, in general terms, Fine Gael approves of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The banking industry is becoming more difficult all the time. The Royal Bank of Scotland is a major shareholder in Ulster Bank in which there are imminent industrial relations problems. Structural changes are being introduced in the bank which are having an adverse impact on employees. I hope the Minister and his advisers, and the management and board of ICC Bank, <Col N="699" /> have taken account of the possibility of difficulties with management and staff when new regimes and business profiles are put in place.</P>
    <P>I compliment the chairman of ICC Bank, Mr. Phil Flynn, who is known to many Members. His jump from trade union activist to bank chairman has been one of the great leaps forward in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal for the sale of ICC Bank. My only reservation is that, in terms of rationalisation in the banking industry, our experience of the Bank of Scotland has been largely in the provision of mortgages. ICC Bank has traditionally been associated with financing small enterprises. Were it not for the availability of its resources, many small enterprises would not be in business. We must accept and acknowledge the part played by ICC Bank in providing resources for the development of many small industrial and other enterprises.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether there is any guarantee that the Bank of Scotland will continue the ideals of ICC Bank or whether its clientele will be looked after in the same way by the Bank of Scotland when it incorporates ICC Bank? This is my only reservation about this proposal, which I welcome in general terms. I hope the acquisition will allow the work of ICC Bank to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no ideological problem with the sale of ICC Bank. I am more concerned about the role and activity of the bank, particularly as regards the establishment of small businesses. I am deeply sceptical about the Bank of Scotland's role in the purchase of this bank. What has been happening to the staff of Ulster Bank has been disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister's comments about guarantees from the staff of ICC Bank to the Bank of Scotland. However, we are seeing the take-over of large banks by banks from outside this State who are applying fairly rigid and tough decisions regarding the closure of branches, the treatment of staff and the breaking of agreements. My concern is there will be no institution to replace ICC Bank if the rainy day returns in terms of venture capital. The Bank of Scotland is a large bank whose commitment is to its shareholders. I understand this approach, but it is not going to look after small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland if it is not to its liking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> Can the Minister obtain any guarantees on the future development of ICC Bank under the control of the Bank of Scotland? The money being raised from the sale will be very useful as it is going into the State's coffers, however people's livelihoods and jobs are at risk. We must take account of events in Ulster Bank, including the threatened closure of its branch in my constituency. Branch offices are part of the banking system and banks must be able to fund them. Banks must also be able to live up to their commitments to staff and not push people around when they take over.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about the situation based on the experience in Ulster Bank. We should look very closely at this proposal. The Minister introduced the Central Bank Bill, which has not yet been moved in the House, which authorises the Central Bank to take into account the continuation of the branch structure as part of the overall banking system. I support this approach as the branch system is essential to many areas.</P>
    <P>Many banks are reducing the services they provide to the public through their branches, there are long queues and people sometimes have to wait 45 minutes to be served. The public is being left behind. What discussions have taken place or what has been put on paper regarding the continuation of the Bank of Scotland's role in the provision of venture capital to small and medium-sized business? What other options were available apart from the sale of ICC Bank?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the overall thrust of the Minister's proposal but I urges a little caution. In the past, companies experiencing difficulties could approach financial institutions such as Fóir Teoranta, ICC Bank and others in the knowledge they would receive assistance. Regrettably, there are no such institutions to which businesses can now go.</P>
      <P>This country is going through a period of business expansion. In the event of a downturn &ndash; which occurs in all aspects of business at different times &ndash; and difficulties arising in the future, there is no banking or financial institution with which the State would have a say in guiding or assisting a company. This loss creates a vacuum and the Minister should address this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC has done excellent work over the years. With regard to the financial structure in banking, many of the rules and regulations introduced by the major banking institutions are ludicrous. Those who have a cheque drawn on the Bank of Ireland in Birr cannot cash it in a branch of the Bank of Ireland in Dublin or Drogheda, they must lodge the cheque in their account. All that does is generate greater profits for the bank, in that, such cheques must be lodged and there is no withdrawal of such moneys. That system imposes additional costs on customers, which while beneficial for generating profits, has resulted in a disimprovement in the service offered to customers. Ordinary customers who carry out everyday banking business get the raw <Col N="701" /> end of the stick, which is regrettable. They are being charged for everything. I am in favour of profits in banks and I have shares in the banks, but the system must be fair. The banks are being hard on customers. The Minister has discussions with the major financial institutions from time to time and he should address that problem with them. I agree, however, with the overall thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I did not agree with the overall thrust of what was in the Bill we passed a few weeks ago, I have no particular difficulty with the motion before us. In a sense, we have flogged this issue to death. We have debated it here at least on four occasions during the past 12 months, but there has not been a meeting of minds. While we have spent a good deal of time debating it, when it comes to the views of the Members on these benches, the Minister has not been on the same planet in terms of dealing with issues that arose in the debate. I believe the Minister is selling the bank for one reason only &ndash; he believes, as a matter of ideological principle, that the State should not own banks. He has not, in any real sense, engaged with the arguments we have heard this morning.</P>
      <P>I can understand why the Minister would not listen to people, such as me, because he would see that there is an ideological gap between us, but what was most striking about the Second Stage debate a month or so ago were the views of Deputies with a small business background. Many of them recounted experiences in their constituencies and, in one or two cases, they recounted personal experiences of having used the facilities offered by the ICC. In the not too distant past the ICC, in some ways, was a lender of last resort. It was a bank that small businesses considered they could approach and use sometimes in circumstances where they could not get loan facilities elsewhere. That is not the case any more. I acknowledge, as others have, that currently it is not difficult for most small businesses to get loan or other facilities, but it is possible that in the not too distant future, circumstances will arise where it will be difficult for small businesses to get loan facilities on acceptable terms. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that the State should have a toe hold in the sector &ndash; and it would be no more than that &ndash; which can nonetheless perform a useful strategic role, not only in what it does but in leveraging the rest of the sector. As the Minister knows well, it has performed that role in the past and it could have done so again. It is unfortunate we will not have that possibility in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the deal before us, I am advised the amount the Minister will get for the bank is reasonable in the circumstances. It is certainly better by a measure of about 30% on what was on offer from the Bank of Ireland last year. I am told the share price is a reasonable one. Others have mentioned the matter of the terms and conditions of employment. It would be useful if the <Col N="702" /> Minister expanded on what he said in his speech this morning.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for making available a note of the conditions under which the Bank is being sold. I notice page 5 of the conditions states the bank guarantees the employment rights of the management and employees of ICC, including amendments, envisaged by the transformation and flexibility agreement, will be fully protected following the completion of the offer. It would be useful in so far as the Minster is able to do so, if he would spell that out more. Others have referred to the experience in Ulster Bank. We all know that when Royal Bank of Scotland purchased National Westminster Bank a year ago, it guaranteed at that stage that the terms and conditions of the work force would be guaranteed into the future, but we know what is currently happening, which is nothing of the kind. Many employees are being asked to re-apply for their jobs using a salary scale that is 20% to 30% lower than what they were on heretofore. I do not understand how that could possibly be considered to be maintaining the terms and conditions of employment. It has always been the stated position of the Minster that in any disposal the terms and conditions of the work force would be guaranteed. He should spell out the position in clear terms to ensure that we will not be in a position in six months or in a year of having to ask, &ldquo;What on earth happened?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan pointed out that the resolution before us is effectively conditional. I ask for more clarity from the Minister in that regard. On the face of it, this exercise appears to allow the Bank of Scotland a number of different exits. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the due diligence exercise has been done and the Bank of Scotland has been satisfied on the portfolio and business of the ICC Bank and the terms and conditions set out are only a belt and braces exercise and do not amount to much.</P>
    <P>Others mentioned what is happening in the banking sector generally. I was interested to hear the Minister say that he hoped the purchase of the ICC Bank by the Bank of Scotland would lead to more competition. I cannot understand how that would be the case. We were talking about the acquisition of one bank by another, which is not currently in the SME business. Why that would lead to a greater degree of competition is beyond me. If there is some reason to expect that would be the case, perhaps the Minster would spell it out. What we are witnessing in the banking sector here is a severe reduction in the number of players. On the day the Minister announced the disposal of ICC, he announced the disposal of TSB, which will be merged with Irish Life and Permanent. What were three separate entities, Irish Life, TSB and Irish Permanent, two or three years ago, is now only one. There is far less competition in the banking sector than there was in the very recent past and there is every indication that this process of consolidation will continue. I fully understand that there is not a great <Col N="703" /> deal the State can do about this. The Minister set up a review group last year, which reported during the summer and made some recommendations. Perhaps he might tell us the position regarding those recommendations. That review group's report was strong on analysis but not all that strong in terms of recommendations. In so far as there were recommendations in relation to the mergers Act, perhaps the Minister would indicate exactly where he is going with that and whether legislation will be introduced in respect of those recommendations in the near future.</P>
    <P>There was some comment about the ESOP or ESOT, I would like the Minister to spell out that position more. Is it the intention of the Bank to run ICC as a wholly owned subsidiary, will it be a separate business entity? The conditions with which we have been furnished appear to suggest that will be the case. If that is so, why is it necessary to swap shares in the ICC for Bank of Scotland shares? If such a swap goes ahead, can we assume it will be a swap for an equal value of Bank of Scotland shares? I take it we are not talking in terms of 5% of Bank of Scotland shares but the same capital value of Bank of Scotland shares.</P>
    <P>I say a few words of appreciation for the work that ICC has done over the years. It has performed a useful strategic role. The stated intention of Bank of Scotland is to continue to service the SME sector and I hope that will prove to be the case. I wish the management and staff of the bank well in this new entity. They served us well within the State structure and I hope they enjoy success. I wish the same for the customers and shareholders of the new bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Deputy Noonan and others asked about the ESOT. The ESOT will acquire the Bank of Scotland shares. Without going into the details of the ESOT, which are quite complicated, the shares go into the trust and are then subject to the rules of the trust. The way ESOTs are set up, it is a considerable time before employees can cash those shares. The same applies to Aer Lingus and certainly to the Eircom ESOT. This is a continuation of that and we have dealt with the tax rules of ESOTs on Committee Stages of Finance Bills. Under ESOT rules, it goes into the ESOT and stays there for some time. That is how ESOTs were negotiated some time ago and, irrespective of whether it is a good principle, it has been agreed by various parties and successive Governments. That is how it is done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke and others raised the issue of the continuing business ethos of the ICC. The ICC traditionally lent to small and medium sized enterprises but, to be frank, in the last sale process many banking institutions looked at the ICC before it narrowed down to six, then three, then one &ndash; Bank of Ireland. Most institutions which looked at the ICC realised it had broadened its vision with the changing environment and gone into areas in which other banks were involved. It was not necessarily confined to small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett asked about the staff of the bank. There are two different institutions involved. I understand Ulster Bank's parent company is the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is different from this body, the Bank of Scotland. The Bank of Scotland is buying ICC while the Royal Bank of Scotland is Ulster Bank's parent company, so it is not the same organisation. However, the point is still relevant. Deputy Barrett referred to a Bill I brought before the House in this regard, but that was a report I asked the banking review group to produce. The group was made up of representatives from my Department, the Central Bank and others and I published its report some months ago; it is not a Bill.</P>
      <P>The report considered various issues in the banking area and it referred to matters raised by Deputy Barrett, such as bank closures and rationalisation in the sector. As I pointed out in answer to parliamentary questions, when I set up the group I said we are likely to wake up some morning in five or six years and find that no bank is Irish owned. One could make that case today, as the two major banks are mostly owned by fund managers who could be anywhere in the world. One could say legitimately that no bank in Ireland could be regarded as an Irish bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it became evident when the Bank of Ireland sought a deal with a bank in the UK that we regard the main banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, as Irish-managed and controlled. Although they are completely independent, the Government may feel they are &ldquo;our&rdquo; banks. One of the reasons we set up this group is in case a Minister for Finance in five or six years' time <Col N="705" /> wonders how it happened that no bank is owned by an Irish group. One of the group's recommendations, which will necessitate changes in legislation, is that some reserve functions are given to the Minister for Finance regarding bank takeovers and, as they relate to competition, I propose to transfer them to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Minister for Finance and the Government of the day have no input into what a bank does, nor should they. Nobody is proposing they should, but banks have wider responsibilities than just making profits for their shareholders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that a few years ago Fóir Teoranta was a lender of last resort. I am not sure if people would regard ICC as a lender of last resort but as it was a State-owned bank people may have felt they got a greater crack of the whip there. I recently launched a book at ICC headquarters written by Frank Casey, who was chief executive of ICC for 22 years and worked for the bank for 42 years. He has written a book on ICC which shows that ICC was the first lender to some of the first Irish-owned manufacturing operations, some of which still exist. ICC had a great input into development of the Irish industrial base and Deputies Enright, Barrett and others may wonder who is going to take up that mantle now.</P>
    <P>The way banking has changed, with Europeanisation, if not globalisation, of the banking market, there is enough competition to cater for all interests. Up to about seven years ago the major banking players, Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, concentrated mainly on small businesses. However, when others got into that market they began what are now very active operations in this area. This was because other operators moved in and took business in that sector. Nowadays the banks come out to one's house if one has a small business idea and one can then get the money. I was in business long enough to remember when they would not give you the time of day. We hope that type of competition continues, thanks to small operators like the TSB, the National Irish Bank and some of the building societies getting into the market. The banks are after every type of business and we hope that continues so we do not go back to the old days.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked about the conditions of employment. As compliments have already been paid to the chairman, Mr. Phil Flynn, Members can take it he was instrumental in ensuring guarantees of employment were copperfastened with any potential purchaser. It has been copperfastened with the Bank of Scotland, which has no out in this deal. It made an offer under the takeover rules and its offer is in the document presented to Deputies yesterday. Deputy McDowell mentioned the review group and the general consolidation in the banking sector. By pure chance, on the same day the ICC offer came before me, the TSB was lucky enough to conclude a deal with Irish Life &amp; Permanent, which <Col N="706" /> we will discuss next term. There is major consolidation in the financial area and, as I have said on a number of occasions, I am afraid there is no place for small banking-type operations in the future. I am glad the ICC has got such a well-known and strong organisation such as the Bank of Scotland to become part of their operation. It is intended that the operation in Ireland will be a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland but then it will be up to the Bank of Scotland in future to decide whatever they want to do in that regard.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;community broadcaster' means a broadcaster which is or is owned by a non-for-profit entity, the structure of which provides for membership, management, operation and programming primarily by members of the community in question, the programming of which is based on community access and reflects the interests and needs of the community in question;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this amendment on Committee Stage. Essentially, I used a formula here used by the Independent Radio and Television Commission as a definition to cover community radio broadcasting. I merely seek to have the same model included in the Bill as it applies to television broadcasting. It is important there is a clear definition of what we are talking about. The amendment is self explanatory and I wish to hear whether the Minister has had a rethink on this issue since we discussed it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I see no advantage in inserting the definition of a community broadcaster contained in amendment No. 1 into legislation. In the context of an ever-changing broadcasting environment, there might be a distinct disadvantage in losing the flexibility which has allowed the commission to proactively support the community sector. However, many of the elements highlighted in the proposed definition are already contained in section 38. Rather than impose a definition which would apply in every case, it is sufficient to require the commission to consider these issues on a case by case basis. There is no reason to tie the hands of the broadcasting commission of Ireland to a particular definition and accordingly, I oppose amendment No. 1.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment. I still think that the Bill would be the stronger for containing the definition. However, I see merit in the point made by the Minister that broadcasting <Col N="707" /> is in a constant state of flux and situations could change. What is contained in this definition are issues of principle rather than issues that relate to changing technology and so on. I do not intend to pursue it at this stage and I also acknowledge that the Minister has indicated that some of these elements are contained later in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;contemporary cultural expression' means the promulgation of those cultural values which can and do enrich contemporary life and promote citizenship;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the definition of an expression which occurs later in the Bill in Part IV, that is, the provisions in relation to the authority and specifically in the subsection that deals with the public service character of the authority's national broadcasting service. The phrase as included there states:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Authority shall ensure that the programme schedules of the broadcasting service referred to in that subsection&ndash; . . . facilitate or assist contemporary cultural expression.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Contemporary cultural expression&rdquo; is a very wide definition. To an extent it includes the good and not so good types of expression present these days. The term &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; is fine. The best aspects of contemporary life should be expressed. I seek to include the definition that contemporary cultural expression means the promulgation of those cultural values which can and do enrich contemporary life and promote citizenship.</P>
      <P>The issue of citizenship is extremely important in the context of the national broadcaster and of the authority. When I had a similar amendment down on Committee Stage, I included at the end of it the phrase &ldquo;over consumerism&rdquo;, that is to promote citizenship over consumerism. I dropped the phrase &ldquo;over consumerism&rdquo; because on reflection it was not appropriate to the definition, not that it invalidated in any way the point I was making. A great deal of the media is targeted at the consumer. We hear all the cliche±s that the consumer is king, is right and so on. Anyone who produces must do so with the consumer in mind but broadcasting is very different from selling shoes, dresses or suits. The broadcasters have a mandate to inform, entertain and educate. My concern is that this phrase could be interpreted, but not in a way conducive to what I am talking about. In terms of the issue of citizenship, many people now are not exercising their franchise, they are not voting. This involves a growing number of people. Members of this House and the media have a responsibility to seek to address the situation and reverse that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> I propose in this amendment that in one case there is a very definite emphasis put on citizenship and all that contains and that there is a clear statement that it is not just the commercial aspects of contemporary life that could be in the ascendancy. We had a long discussion on this on Committee Stage. The Minister indicated she would consider it between Committee and Report Stage and I am interested to hear if she has had any further thoughts in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>During Committee Stage, as the Deputy said, I indicated I would consider using the wording proposed by Deputy O'Shea in amendment No. 2. After some deliberation I decided not to proceed with Deputy O'Shea's amendment. The phrase &ldquo;contemporary cultural expression&rdquo; was inserted in the Bill in the context of the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty which recognises that the system of public service broadcasting in the member states is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society. It accepts it is within the competence of the member states to define the public service remit of broadcasters as they see fit and to provide for funding of broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of that remit. Accordingly, section 28 of the Bill is designed to provide greater clarity as to what is expected in fulfilment of its public service remit by RTE. The insertion of the phrase &ldquo;contemporary cultural expression&rdquo; is designed to ensure that RTE could continue to support RTE's performing groups, such as the National Symphony Orchestra, the RTE Concert Orchestra and the RTE Vanbrugh String Quartet. While the limits set on contemporary cultural expression by Deputy O'Shea in his proposed definition are desirable and laudable, they could limit the options of the authority in an unhelpful way. The orchestra is a national treasure but I am not sure if it could be said to promote citizenship. I do wish to dilute in any way the intended effect of the provision by defining it in any other context and, accordingly, I oppose the amendment though I regret doing so. However, for the reasons I have given I believe I have no other option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her thoughtful and comprehensive reply. It is obvious that, in terms of intent, there is nothing between us. The Minister has introduced the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty which puts the amendment into a different context. That was not available to us during the debate on Committee Stage. As regards the wording &ldquo;promulgation of those cultural values&rdquo;, culture is a broad brush, embracing everything we do. The functions of the national broadcaster regarding the orchestra and the string quartet are laudable. It is an important part of national life. However, I want a clear statement that it is not the intention to have the unhealthy focus on consumerism that exists in the media worldwide. There is more and more commercialism in the media. Whether that reflects <Col N="709" /> what is happening in society or whether it contributes to or causes it, I do not know. It is of paramount importance to have the emphasis on the promotion of citizenship in this legislation, which is the last on broadcasting we will have during the life of this Dáil and, I suspect, for some time to come.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister will not agree to the amendment and I will not press it. I have made my arguments and believe there is a meeting of minds between me and the Minister. For technical reasons and based on advice she has received, the Minister believes it is inappropriate. I do not share that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;(1) The Minister shall by regulations prohibit any person from enjoying an excessive concentration of media ownership.</P>
      <P>(2) In making such regulations the Minister shall be guided by the principle that a person who owns more than 20 per cent. of enterprises in one medium shall not own more than 20 per cent. of enterprises in another medium.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment reflects a Private Members' Bill my party introduced some time ago. It reflects a concern of the Labour Party on over-dominant positions developing within the media in the State. The text of the amendment is simple. Where one individual has 20% of the enterprises in one medium he or she should be confined to no more than 20% in another medium.</P>
      <P>If there is an over-dominant position and one person owns or controls too large a part of the media &ndash; I am talking about cross-media, the print versus electronic &ndash; it could be that a particular philosophy could dominate the titles and various radio or television channels owned by that person. It is about freedom for the citizen to receive information, but not in an over-focused way from any one individual. It is unhealthy that this should develop. The Minister, on Committee Stage, was not disposed towards accepting the amendment but my views on the matter have not changed. It is important in a democracy to ensure no person develops an unhealthy level of control. The danger is that public opinion could be manipulated, particularly in the context of elections and so on.</P>
      <P>On reflection, and having listened to the arguments on Committee Stage, this is an important aspect of the legislation. It refers to the fundamentals of democracy and is a serious matter which this legislation should address.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage. Fine Gael supported the Private Members' Bill. There is concern to ensure <Col N="710" /> there is not over-dominance and that the public hears all views. It is a useful amendment on which I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments. I support the principle of trying to control ownership of the various media to ensure a balance and that there is not over-emphasis on one point of view. That is important when dealing with such a powerful medium across all platforms.</P>

      <P>As I said during the course of the debate on Second and Committee Stages, this matter is more proper to the competition and mergers legislation. It is a matter for the Tanáiste who has announced plans in this regard. Deputy O'Shea will recall that I referred to the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group which was published by the Tanáiste in May 2000. Arising from that report, the Government decided on 24 October that the existing law on competition and mergers is to be replaced by new consolidated competition and mergers legislation which will address newspaper and media mergers. Accordingly, it is not appropriate for me to address these issues in this Bill. I oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>The views expressed today by Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Clune are important and I concur with them. However, this legislation is not the vehicle in which to express them. It is up to another Department and Minister to review the legislation. This will be done and will address newspaper and media mergers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister presented those arguments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Obviously, her point is that it is for another Department and for different legislation to address this issue. The Minister said legislation is being consolidated but from what she said, the legislation will go beyond that and this whole area of media ownership will be part of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, is it not appropriate in the context of legislation which deals with the area of television specifically and electronic communication, that there should be some statement in the legislation on ownership? As I said on Committee Stage, there is a concern that outside owners could become large players on the Irish scene and could buy up much of the broadcasting capacity and broadcasting licences which are there already. Obviously, if somebody is operating from outside the State, other problems start to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a concern that with excessive cross ownership of media, the balance between the viewer and the providers could become out of synchronisation and there could be over-promulgation of one point of view. The other concern, particularly in the area of television, is that operators outside the State could accumulate a large amount of the capacity within the State and that could cause difficulties in terms of an over dominant position. That aspect needs to be fleshed out a great deal more than we have time for today. As it is not specifically referred to in the amend<Col N="711" /> ment, I do not intend to go any further. However, there should be an upper limitation in terms of the level of ownership of enterprises within the electronic media and in the context of our debate on television.</P>

      <P>The concerns expressed by Deputy O'Shea are very legitimate ones. I hope we will have an opportunity in another forum to discuss those issues by way of new legislation which is being proposed by the Tánaiste. These issues should be discussed. The competition and mergers legislation is the responsibility of another Department and Minister and, therefore, it would be more appropriate to that legislation. That is not to say I do not share the concerns but I do not believe the inclusion of the Deputy's amendment in this legislation would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 45, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;acting only upon the advice of the Director following an open, fair and transparent selection procedure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed inserting the words that the Minister &ldquo;acting only upon the advice of the Director following an open, fair and transparent selection procedure&rdquo; would award very valuable broadcasting licences for a transmission company and a multiplex company. In the interests of openness and fairness, a decision to award such a valuable licence should not be in the power of one individual. I am not taking from the calibre of the present Minister but there have been a great many media reports on events at tribunals. The issue of licences under the original broadcasting Act is certainly up for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The awarding of such valuable licences should not lie with one individual. This week the Director of Telecommunications Regulation announced the awarding of a 3G mobile phone <Col N="712" /> licence in an open licence round. On Committee Stage the Minister said this amendment would put an onus on the director. The director herself said at a hearing of the committee that she would be willing to give guidance on the award of these licences. It would give the public more confidence. The issue could be dealt with at a distance from the Minister and the ODTR would deal with the issue of awarding these licences as in the case of mobile phone licences.</P>
    <P>It is not correct in these times that the Minister would retain such power. These licences will be very valuable. Very valuable frequencies, which are the property of the citizens of State, will be awarded to an individual or company. That decision should not be made by one person and should be made in a more open and fair fashion. That is the reason I tabled these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt at considerable length on Committee Stage with the difference of philosophy between my policy on digital television and that of Deputy Clune. The Government has decided that the DTT platform is the transmission platform best suited to achieving near universal coverage for Irish indigenous broadcasting services. The legislative framework which establishes the DTT platform in Ireland must address issues that go beyond those that simply regard broadcasting services as just another telecommunications service. For this reason, it is appropriate that the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting should, on behalf of the people of the State, have in this instance the primary role in the selection of suitable candidates to act as the transmission company and the multiplex company.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 4, 7 and 8 are designed to give the Director of Telecommunications Regulation the deciding role in the selection of the transmission and multiplex operators. For the reasons I have already outlined, I cannot accept this position. I, too, am concerned to ensure that the process of selection in both cases is open, fair and transparent. Such a process is subject to national and EU obligations with regard to fairness of the tendering procedures used. In order to provide assurances in this regard for all involved in the process, I have decided to appoint a process auditor who will provide an opinion on the openness, fairness and impartiality of processes as executed. Accordingly, I oppose these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Clune's amendments. I am not really happy with the Minister's reply principally because when another broadcasting Bill was being discussed in this House, the then Minister, Ray Burke, came to certain conclusions almost similar to what the Minister has said. We have since learned that his actions were not independent. Fair competition is necessary given that technology has brought a spate of companies interested in providing a broadcasting service. The Minister should have <Col N="713" /> properly considered this matter. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, was prepared to give the regulator the sole discretion. In this case Deputy Clune is giving some guidelines to the regulator about the standards that would be acceptable and has emphasised that they should be open and transparent. The Minister is in error. In view of the different matters involved she has an opportunity to set the record straight. There is also the matter of the spectrum. There is a fundamental difference in the thinking of the Minister and the thinking of the Opposition in this case. We see it as a very valuable asset while the Minister does not see it in that way. Deputy Clune's amendment is the best way to meet the challenges for the future. Not reflecting on the Minister, the precedent in the broadcasting area, in this House already, has left huge gaps where there was no transparency and where officials from the same Department admitted in Dublin Castle that the Minister did not consult them but made up his own mind. The precedent is there and it has been a sorry one. This whole business in the broadcasting area has been a sorry business. Rather than prolong the agony the Minister should concede.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. It is a mistake as Deputy Carey has said. How can we be assured that there will be an independent assessment and that licences will be awarded independently? The Minister mentioned that she would appoint an auditor but we do not know who that will be. Obviously the auditor will act on the Minister's instructions. We have heard from the tribunal that a previous Minister appointed his own solicitor and his own banker. This raises many questions for us. While the past is the past and there is nothing we can do about what happened in the past this legislation provides an opportunity to introduce an element of transparency and openness so that everybody will be satisfied that such a valuable asset as is the broadcasting spectrum in which there is great interest and for which a great deal of money will be needed, will not be made a gift to any individual or company. I strongly believe, and this principle was raised by Deputy Kenny on Second Stage, the Minister should not retain such powers for herself. It should be awarded by the director, following consultation with the Minister, but in an open and transparent selection procedure. That is a principle about which we feel strongly and I am disappointed with the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have sympathy with the amendment in the context of where Deputy Clune is coming from. Recent events at the tribunals have left a bad taste in relation to this whole area. As Deputy Carey has said, nobody in this House attributes anything but the highest standards to the Minister. That justice is done and is seen to be done is very important. The idea the Minister has put forward of the appointment of a process auditor has merit. In terms of trans<Col N="714" /> parency and everything being seen to be fair and open, who will appoint this auditor? What will be the terms of reference of the auditor? Will the auditor be totally and utterly independent of the Minister of the day and of the Department? Those are important issues.</P>
      <P>Under amendments Nos. 7 and 8 the Minister would be obliged to consult the Minister for Public Enterprise. There is a conflict between that amendment and what is in the Bill. However, that is a technical point. Will the Minister outline exactly who the process auditor will be, the qualifications required, the terms of reference and give an assurance that the process auditor will be independent of the Department and of the Minister? In other words, this person will look at all the stages in terms of arriving at the designation and will adjudicate that this was fairly done or not properly done.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a transmission company and a multiplex company after that. We are not talking about companies which are broadcasters <i>per se,</i> but rather companies that provide the highway. I do not think the point made about the director is quite valid. The director awards the telephone licences. They are technical in nature. What the multiplex company and the transmission company are involved in is technical by nature. Obviously the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has another function in terms of the broadcast element. I see no validity in saying broadcasting is different in the context of transmission and multiplex companies. I entreat the Minister to respond to these amendments so that we can all be satisfied that there will be an open, fair and transparent process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see a system in place that is open, fair and transparent and that is precisely what I am working towards. There is a fundamental difference in principle with regard to the amendments tabled on Committee Stage and on Report Stage by Deputy Clune on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. I know that Deputy Michael D. Higgins shares my view. No doubt he was expressing the view of the Labour Party when he said both publicly and privately to me that he would join me in believing the whole question of broadcasting should be driven by the Department which has responsibility for arts and culture. If it were left to the technical remit of the ODTR the whole cultural element would be lost. That is precisely the whole philosophy behind the question of the ODTR and the proposals being put forward in these amendments. When we are looking for the establishment of DTT we are not talking about the issuing of mobile telephone licences. The issuing of mobile telephone licences does not require any cultural input whereas broadcasting is at the heart of the cultural philosophy. That is where there is a very deep division between the view expressed in the Fine Gael amendments on Committee Stage and this Stage and the views expressed by myself and the Labour Party on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Deputy O'Shea spoke earlier about the difference between citizens and consumers. People could be described as consumers in regard to the issuing of mobile telephone licences. However, we talk about citizens in the far wider debate on broadcasting, which is why the whole philosophy of the culturally driven Broadcasting Bill is of major importance.</P>
    <P>The kind of process we want to see established here will obviously, as I said in my initial reply, have to be subject to the national and EU regulations on fairness of the tendering processes used. The question of a process auditor was introduced during the Telecom flotation. That is a very good model which ensures fairness and impartiality within the process. While I am not able to name the person I am considering for the position of process auditor, which I hope the House will understand, I can say the person I hope will take the job is a very respected member of the community and a former Secretary General of the utmost integrity with the kind of skills, knowledge and expertise needed in this process.</P>
    <P>That is why I believe the amendments tabled by Fine Gael do not deal with the kind of issues I would accept, in terms of the principle of broadcasting being led by the Department with responsibility for culture, as opposed to the Department of Public Enterprise and the ODTR. The kind of process that will be put into action will be open, fair and transparent because I would not stand over anything other than such a system.</P>

      <P>I am amused by the way the Minister is trying to twist this around, as if there were a chasm between all our thinking on public service broadcasting. There is no problem here with public service broadcasting. This is about the issue of giving a transmission company power, which we want to see done fairly.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand how the Minister can see a tremendous difference between the views of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party on this matter. At no stage did we differ but the Minister is trying her best to say we did, perhaps with an eye to future possible partnership in Government with the Labour Party, so that she can say they agreed on broadcasting principles and on the next Minister for culture.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was appointing the Minister, he dropped culture from the title of the Department. Culture was the last thing on Fianna Fáil's mind. When the argument was put to the Taoiseach from this side of the House, particularly by Deputy Higgins, he said that culture was most important. Our record of attendance at the meetings of culture Ministers in Europe indicates the Department's current interest in that area of Irish life. It is ridiculous for the Minister to tell me that her desire to pro<Col N="716" /> tect Irish culture is her reason for not allowing transparency and openness in the awarding of a licence for a transmission company.</P>

      <P>We are talking here, as Deputy Carey said, about the awarding of a licence to a transmission company. This licence will be very valuable. We discussed on Committee Stage the fact that the broadcasting frequencies will be attached to this licence. This is a fundamental principle. Nobody is anti-culture, as the Minister said. We feel very strongly about protecting our public service broadcasters. We are dealing here with a transmission company and a lucrative licence that will be awarded by one individual. The Minister mentioned a process auditor, but that is not enshrined in the Bill and, as she said, we do not know who that person will be.</P>
      <P>This is probably the last broadcasting legislation for quite some time and we do not know who will be the future Ministers with responsibility for broadcasting. It is important to ensure at this stage that we have an open and transparent procedure for the awarding of licences to transmission companies. We are talking about a transmission company here and not a broadcaster. I feel very strongly about this. The Minister should consider this important amendment for the Seanad debate. This is a fundamental principle. We are not seeking to in any way interfere with the quality or content of broadcasting. This is simply a question of the awarding of a very lucrative licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has not identified the person she has in mind for the position of process auditor, the person is obviously a former civil servant who held high office. We cannot comment beyond that.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that the broadcasting commission of Ireland is the body that will deal with content and what is actually broadcast. The other two companies, the transmission company and the multiplex company, will deal with providing the highway. There is a valid comparison to be made between the role of the director and the role of the Minister, as the legislation stands at present. The responsibility for the content of broadcasting aspect lies elsewhere. That point is effectively unanswerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the reputation of politics and politicians is not all that it might be in the public arena, I am still of the view that politicians and Ministers are to be trusted. I would not like to give the impression that I have any other view. However, the electorate demands that we are open, fair in what we do, transparent and answerable. I see merit in the concept of a process auditor. However, the Minister has not answered the questions I put earlier regarding the terms of reference of the auditor. How can it be demonstrated that the auditor has no functions involving the Minister of the day and the Department? If the office of the auditor is completely and demonstrably independent of the Minister and if the <Col N="717" /> person appointed is of such a calibre and reputation to effectively win the confidence of the electorate or the viewership there is merit in that approach.</P>
    <P>There is no divergence of views on this issue between us and the Fine Gael Party, nor does there appear to be too much of a gap between the Minister and the Fine Gael Party with regard <Col N="718" /> to the basic problem, which is that procedures are carried out in a fair and proper way that is clear and verifiable. I would like more clarity on the process auditor because it may be a less bureaucratic way of dealing with the very important issue of public confidence in all that is done by politicians, Members of this House and Ministers.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 9 are related and will be discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 6 to 11 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) any shares in the company are owned by the Minister, who shall not alienate his or her interest therein,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the original Bill was that one company would take the transmission and multiplex function and RTE could have a holding of up to 40% in that company. When the Minister came back on Committee Stage she had altered that position considerably. There is now to be a transmission company in which RTE can have a stake of up to 28%. There will also be a multiplex company which will enter into direct contracts with the various broadcasters.</P>
      <P>From the beginning the Labour Party held the view that the transmission infrastructure of RTE should remain within public control. Our proposal is that a commercial semi-State body should be set up to discharge these functions. Obviously things have changed in that, initially, like the Minister, we were talking about one company. We are now seeking that both companies remain within public control and be operated as commercial semi-State companies. What has perplexed members of the Labour Party is why RTE should have any stake in the new company, as was the original position, or the new companies. Obviously the 28% which RTE can avail of will be in the transmission company only and not in the multiplex company. The amendments propose that the Minister remains the owner of the transmission infrastructure on behalf of the public. We accept the two company model at this stage but we are seeking that both companies would be commercial semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the up to 40% holding which RTE could have had in the company or the 28% which RTE can now have in the transmission company, the Minister said on Committee Stage that RTE indicated it could make a decent return in terms of its involvement in the transmission company. That may or may not be the case. The logic of the national broadcaster being part of the company is what we are concerned about. We believe this asset should remain within public control. Both the amendments seek that any shares in the company are owned by the Minister, who shall not alienate his or her interest in them. We have been through these arguments at great length on Committee Stage. It is still a matter of concern to the Labour Party because we believe the model we are proposing is the more appropriate one and would be the better model in the public interest. I suspect the Minister has not changed her position from that on Committee Stage. However, I would like to hear her response.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy said, I dealt with these amendments at some length on Committee Stage. While I do not wish to go over all that ground again, amendments Nos. 5 and 9 represent a fundamental difference of policy in the establishment of DTT platform in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that it is in the public interest that the platform be developed as a private commercial enterprise. As I indicated previously, the original idea for the sale of the existing broadcast transmission infrastructure came from the RTE authority as a basis on which to proceed and in recognition of the magnitude of the capital investment necessary to successfully roll out the digital terrestrial platform to viewers. The attendant risks associated with this investment are more appropriate to the private sector than the taxpayer. Accordingly, I oppose the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened intently to the Minister and Deputy O'Shea on the sale of RTE. The original figure was 40% which was then reduced to 28%. The Minister has not ever explained why the figure of 28% was arrived at. This is an aspect of the behind the door negotiations which took place. The public should be informed why this decision was made. RTE is a public asset and investment has been made by the public in this project for years. I do not understand why the Minister is reluctant to indicate how the figure of 28% was arrived at. Given that the Minister and the RTE authority are anxious for investment, it will not help her vision for the future for RTE if she is not open about this issue. While RTE will seek a serious partner, people will be inhibited if it is not disclosed how these figures were arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The question inherent in Deputy Carey's remarks is very important. There are no guarantees at this stage that a private operator will be available to take up the remaining 72% in the transmission company or the totality of the multiplex company. That is something market forces will decide. However, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that there would be no takers for either the transmission company or the multiplex company. Is there a plan B in that context? What would the Minister propose if that were to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Carey, I represent an urban-rural constituency. A great attraction for me in terms of DTT is that the new platform will reach places in my constituency which are difficult to reach at the moment. The attraction of this is a better quality service with a better quality picture. The question of how the figure of 40% was arrived at and the figure of 28% in relation to a possible RTE equity holding in the transmission company is still baffling. Why does RTE want to be involved? The Minister advanced the explanation that it would provide an income that could help to finance its other activities. That makes sense <Col N="721" /> but I remain to be convinced that that is how it will turn out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not indicated clearly how the 28% stake RTE will acquire in this company was arrived at. We are discussing an asset of the State, which is owned by the people, and it is important that we should be told how the figure was arrived at, who made the decision and why the final figure is 28% and not the original 40%.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed the fact that this company will obtain a very valuable frequency licence, which is, again, the property of the citizens of this State. Is it acceptable that such an important asset should be given to a company, 72% of which will be in private ownership? I was not satisfied with the answer we received to that question on Committee Stage. Under the Bill, the broadcasting frequencies attaching to the licence will be handed over to a private entity. That should not be allowed to happen because there is no reason for frequencies to be attached to this licence. The transmission company is purely a means of delivering programme content and matters should be left as they currently stand.</P>
      <P>We debated this issue at length on Committee Stage but, nevertheless, it is important to raise it again because we were not satisfied with the replies we received at that point. With the advent of liberalisation, which will be forthcoming in the next two years when draft directives are accepted, it will be seen that this company has been given a valuable spectrum frequency, which is a State asset, and the reasons for this are not clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that Deputy O'Shea would have wished to have had both companies in State control. It was envisaged that 40% of the original company, Digico, would be owned by RTE. However, there are now two companies.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of revisiting this matter in detail because we had an extensive debate on it on Committee Stage and, as Deputy O'Shea stated, we each outlined our stances in respect of the issues in question. However, it is important to highlight the reason that RTE wished to be part of this transmission company. There is no doubt that RTE has access to people with the relevant skills and expertise and I was anxious to ensure that we could put in place a platform that could be rolled out. I agree with the Deputy that the DTT platform will ensure the greatest amount of access, that is why it was chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I stated that I did not think it would be appropriate to have any stake in the multiplex or retail company because it has no particular involvement in that kind of retail business. It would not be appropriate for programme makers to be involved in a company of <Col N="722" /> that nature. With regard to the transmission company, the original idea for the sale of the existing broadcasting transmission infrastructure was put forward by the RTE Authority. I have explained on a number of occasions &ndash; whether Deputies accept my explanation is another matter &ndash; that the figure of 28% was arrived at as a result of my having to find a balance between the RTE stake in that company and&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The time for the Minister's reply is exhausted. I call Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point made by the Minister is that there will be no meeting of minds on this issue. However, I wish to make a number of points in response to what she said.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the skills and expertise of RTE employees, which we take as a given. However, the establishment of the company in question would mean that those employees would be transferred from RTE to that company. The fact that those members of staff are employed by RTE does not justify the transfer of a stake in the company to RTE. I am sure the Minister will ensure that the pay and conditions of those transferring out of RTE will not be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that she was obliged to reach a balance and that it was this which led her to arrive at figures of 40% and 28%. However, there does not appear to be any strategic reason put forward with regard to why RTE, in the first instance, wanted to obtain a stake of 40% in Digico and, latterly, why it desired a stake of 28% in the transmission company. The only reason being put forward is that the station's stake could act as an income stream.</P>
      <P>The roll-out of digital terrestrial television has not been an instant success. I suspect that, in the short to medium term, the substantial returns which are expected to accrue from the operations of the company to RTE via its 28% stake will not materialise. I do not believe any assessment of the position would lead one to adopt an optimistic view of what will happen in this regard.</P>
      <P>There will be some other services such as those involving telemarketing, etc., in which the new company will be involved. However, as I understand it, there is quite limited capacity in terms of developing those services at present. We must recognise that the valuation placed on the asset is the best which can be arrived at in respect of it at a particular stage. There is always the possibility that the value of this asset, which came into being as a result of subscriptions made by the general public through the payment of licence fees, could, in the medium to long-term, increase to a level much greater than that at which it currently stands.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister does not intend to agree to my amendments and, given that there are other important issues which require debate on Report Stage, I will withdraw them.</P>

Every Member, including the Minister, can speak twice but their second contribution may last only two minutes. However, the proposer of an amendment may make a third and final contribution. Once a Member has made their second contribution they may not comment further on the matter under discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The transmission company shall endeavour to ensure, in so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, that the services provided by it are made available to the whole community in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am introducing these amendments in response to concerns expressed by Deputies O'Shea and Clune on Committee Stage with regard to universal coverage on the DTT platform and in the context of discussions on the issue with the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 inserts a subsection into section 5 which will oblige the transmission company to endeavour to ensure, in so far as it is reasonably practicable, that its services are available to the whole community in the State. Amendment No. 11 inserts a similar obligation into section 8 which deals with the multiplex company.</P>
      <P>These two amendments will ensure there is no doubt in the minds of the operators or the regulators that the Government sees DTT as a universal access platform, as far as this is practically possible. The DTT platform is the guarantee of universal access to Irish free-to-air services. The amendments proposed recognise the practical difficulties which may be encountered in trying to ensure 100% coverage while, at the same time, placing a specific onus on both companies to do all that is reasonable to ensure maximum coverage.</P>
      <P>These amendments, together with the specific coverage obligations which will be imposed by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in the DTT licence, will ensure maximum coverage for Irish free-to-air broadcasting services, including TG4.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes that the transmission company shall endeavour to ensure, in so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, that the services provided by it are made available to <Col N="724" /> the whole community in the State. References to the island of Ireland were an element of our discussions on committee stage. Can I take it that it is not possible for the Minister to seek to make programmes available to everyone in the island of Ireland? Why is it not possible to provide services throughout the island of Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments which follow discussions on Committee Stage. It is important to ensure coverage in all areas. This matter was raised on Committee Stage following submissions from TG4. It is accepted that 100% coverage is impossible but we aim to get 97% coverage. In many peripheral areas TG4 has only 60% coverage. Since our discussions on Committee Stage I have been given a document by TG4 which shows that in many Gaeltacht areas the station's signal is below reception level. It is a matter of concern that the Irish language channel cannot be received in many Gaeltacht areas. I do not know if 100% coverage can be achieved but we should aspire to that and such a provision should be included in this legislation.</P>
      <P>A later amendment in my name proposes that TG4 be carried on MMDF. This would overcome the station's difficulties in trying to achieve as near universal coverage as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain how a transmission company in which the State will be a 28% shareholding is obliged to provide a service to the whole community? The Government has taken a decision to own only 28% of this private company. If, in the future, an attempt is made to impose this provision in the courts, the company may say it can fulfil these provision but at a cost of several million pounds. Who will meet that cost? </P>
      <P>We are laying up difficulties for ourselves in the future. The transmission company could be faced with a huge outlay in order to comply with this provision. Will RTE, which will own 28% of the company and which depends on licence holders for its revenue, be obliged to comply with this provision while maintaining the licence fee at the current level? How does the Minister envisage this transmission company operating on a day to day basis and facing its various costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea is quite right. We should be concerned that every corner of the country receives a proper service. It is all very well to say this when one has control of the situation through a public broadcasting company. However, we are selling 72% to private investors who are in the business to make a profit. They may comply with the State's request to do certain things only if their compliance is publicly funded. On the other hand the public service broadcasting company, which depends on licence fees for its income, will own 28% of the transmission company. I support public service broadcasting. Given international developments in the world of television, if we are to keep the public informed of what is happening in our own boundaries it is important that we <Col N="725" /> retain a public service broadcasting servce. That service should be properly funded and should not be expected to operate as commercial broadcasters do. However, the Bill proposes that the public service broadcasting company becomes involved in a transmission company. We also propose that a service be provided to all corners of the State. If a future Minister enforces this section a court will be asked to interpret it. What will interpretation cost the taxpayer and RTE? How does the Minister envisage this provision working on a day to day basis?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We talked on Committee Stage about the necessity to ensure the best possible coverage for our indigenous stations and we referred, in particular, to TG4. The DTT service provides the best chance of getting the kind of universal coverage we wish to see. We also accepted that 100% coverage cannot be guaranteed, despite what one might wish.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Shea, the DTT platform operator in Northern Ireland will get licences from the British authorities. Deputy Barrett raised the question of the legality of these proposals. The proposals have been examined from every point of view, particularly with regard to their legal implications, as must be done with any legislation. The proposals being put through the House have been examined from every point of view, particularly with regard to the legal implications, as is the case with any good legislation. All of these proposals have been examined by the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Island (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the policy of the Government regarding Teilifís na Gaeilge, otherwise known as TG4, it is my intention that the station be established as a separate statutory entity. The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House, will, when enacted, provide enabling powers for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As provided for in the Bill, I envisage TG4 will provide a national television service that will have the character of a public service with a comprehensive range of programmes primarily in the Irish language. In addition to programmes in the <Col N="726" /> Irish language, TG4 will be required to have regard to the need to cater for the expectations of audiences who are not generally catered for by other broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>There will be a need for extensive discussions and consultation after the Bill is enacted on the detail of proceeding with and the timing of the establishment of Teilifís na Gaelige as a separate entity. It will be necessary to have adequate structures and funding in place. It will also be necessary to have statutory arrangements in place for the station's ongoing relationship with RTE in relation to a number of important matters. I expect the process of establishing TG4 as a separate entity will take a number of years.</P>
    <P>I have secured £18.4 million in funding for the station for 2001. That represents an increase of more than 23% on the current year and is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of TG4. On the basis of my discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I am confident I will be in a position to secure a further significant increase in funding to support the station's development plan in the context of the Estimates for 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>We all support TG4. The programming it provides is very popular. The Minister said that its establishment as a separate entity will take a number of years. TG4 is anxious that such an establishment date should be fixed, that there should be a finite time within which it would be established as a separate entity. We tabled amendments to the Broadcasting Bill, that TG4 should be established as a separate entity within two years of the enactment of that Bill. Does the Minister consider that will be possible? While the Minister said she secured £18.4 million in funding for the station in the Estimates for 2001, TG4 is not sure what level of funding it will get from year to year, which makes it difficult for it to plan for its future development. Does the Minister consider it would be valuable for TG4 if it was guaranteed a percentage of the licence fee income, given that it is a public service broadcaster and provides a valuable service, which, as the Minister said, is not generally catered for by other broadcasting services? I would like the Minister to address the question of TG4 being guaranteed a percentage of the licence fee income collected in the public service broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When I published the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, in May 1999 TG4's reaction to it was nervous in that it did not wish to be separated from RTE and established as a separate entity overnight. I said at that time, and continue to say, that a great deal of work must be undertaken before that separation can take place. The Broadcasting Bill is enabling legislation, which will ensure that when the time is right, when there is an agreement between Comhairle and RTE, and they want to proceed along those lines, the <Col N="727" /> necessary legislation to facilitate that will be in place.</P>
      <P>A number of matters will have to be addressed before TG4 will become a statutory entity, one being the ongoing current funding levels of the station. The Government will have to be satisfied regarding TG4's plans for the future, the associated costs and its ongoing relationship with RTE, including access to RTE's facilities, including archive material, transmission costs, etc. The fine details will have to be worked out.</P>
      <P>I noticed, even over the past year or 18 months, there is an appetite in TG4 for this to happen. We all know that TG4 is a vibrant organisation. It is an example of what can be done in broadcasting, particularly regarding young people's involvement. That is why I have been happy to ensure we have given it a substantial increase in funding, even on the past year. The increase in funding I secured for TG4 for 2001 represents an increase of more than 23% on the current year.</P>
      <P>I hope the Broadcasting Bill will soon be enacted and then the issue of establishing TG4 as a separate entity will be a matter for further negotiations between RTE, Comhairle and government. It is something we would like to see happen and that is why it has been part of Government policy to ensure that we will be able to provide such enabling powers.</P>

Labhair mé go mion is go minic i dtaobh ábhar na ceiste seo go ginearálta ó ceapadh mé mar Aire Stáit agus tá cóipeanna de na hóráidí a thug mé in áiteanna éagsúla agus go deimhin féin ceann de ha hóráidí is tábhachtaí a thug mé ar an ábhar seo thug mé thíos i nDún Garbháin i bPort Láirge é aimsir an Oireachtais. An rud a dúirt mé agus an rud a sheasaim leis ná nach mbeidh sé indéanta nó réalaíoch, agus is trua nach féidir é a dhéanamh i dtíortha ar nós Ceanada, sé sin go bhféadfadh duine ar bith siúl isteach in oifig phoiblí ar bith agus gnó a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge le hoibrí poiblí nó stát seirbhíseach ar bith.</P>

Mar is eol don Teachta tógtar costas san áireamh i ngach aon reachtaíocht a chuirtear ar aghaidh agus tá mé iomlán sásta go mbeidh Bille thar a bheith maith againn ag deireadh an lae. Is ceist ansin do Thithe an Oireachtais breithiúnas a thabhairt ar an mBille nuair a fhoilseofar é. Tá fhios ag an Teachta nach féidir liom dul isteach i mion-sonraí atá á moladh agus á bplé i láthair na huaire go dtí go mbeidh cinneadh Rialtais deireannach ar an mBille ar fáil. Tá fhios ag an Teachta é sin. Cloistear go leor scéalta nach mbíonn fíor, nóiméad amháin ag an dream seo, nóiméad eile ag an dream siúd. An t-aon mhoill atá leis seo ná an gnáth obair a bhíonn i gceist. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil níos mó ceisteanna ann, cuid mhaith acu ardaithe agam féin go deimhin, ag iarraidh a chinntiú nuair a thiocfaidh sé chun cinn gur rud tairbheach, foirfeach, críochniúil a bheidh ann agus go mbeidh sé infheidhmithe, mar go minic, le 70 bliana anuas, an fhadhb a bhí ann le pleananna chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn go raibh siad thar cinn ar pháipéar ach nach bhféadfaí iad a fheidhmiú go praiticiúil.

      <P>Dírim aird an Teachta ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar Cheist Uimh. 129 den 4 Deireadh Fómhair agus ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar Cheisteanna Uimhreacha 101, 108, 117, 124, 135 agus 143 den 14 Samhain.</P>
      <P>Bhunaigh an Rialtas Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht nios luaithe i mbliana chun moltaí a dhéanamh maidir leis an nGaeilge a láidriú mar ghnáthurlabhra phobal na Gaeltachta. Táim sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag an gcoimisiúin go dáta ag cur san áireamh na téarmaí tagartha leathan atá tugtha dó.</P>
      <P>Faoi láthair tá an Coimisiún ag eagrú sraith cruinnithe oscailte ar fud na Gaeltachta agus lasmuigh di chun deis a thabhairt don phobal tuairimí agus moltaí ó bhéal a chur ar aghaidh. Go deimhin féin tá breis is 100 aighneacht i scríbhinn faighte ag an gcoimisiún ón bpobal go dáta. Tuigim go mbeidh an próiséas comhairlithe poiblí seo críochnaithe go luath i 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cé nach féidir a rá go beacht ag an bpointe seo bheadh súil agam go mbeadh tuarascáil an choimisiúin ar fáil roimh dheireadh 2001. Ba che<Col N="730" /> ist don Rialtas ina dhiaidh sin an Tuarascáil a fhoilsiú.</P>

      <P>Nuair a chuirfidh an Coimisiún na moltaí agus na pleananna ar fáil sa tuairisc, cad iad na geallúintí a thig leis an Aire Stáit a thabhairt don Dáil go gcuirfear an tuairisc i bhfeidm? Tá go leor tuairiscí agus pleananna againn don Ghaeilge ó Bhord na Gaeilge. ó Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, ó Chonradh na Gaeilge agus ó gach eagraíocht Ghaeilge.

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá ceist an-tábhachtach curtha ag an Teachta. Thiocfainn leis go mór. Ní haon mhaith tuarascáil a chur ar fáil mura bhfuil seans an-mhaith ann go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm é.  Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, níl aon chóras faoin Stát faoi gur féidir aon gheallúint a thabhairt go gcuirfear rud ar bith i bhfeidhm nach bhfuil eolas ag daoine air fós. Tá mise sásta go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm é. Seachas Coimisiún a bheadh bunaithe ag an Aire is Coimisiún é seo atá bunaithe ag an Rialtas agus is chuige sin a thóg mé cúpla mí breise ag tús na bliana ag cur an mholadh seo faoi bhráid an Rialtais le dearbhú an Rialtais a fháil le go mbeadh seasamh an-ard ag an gCoimisiún seo seachas thar mar a bheadh ag tuarascáil a chuirfeadh Aire fios air.</P>
      <P>Is ar an gcaoi sin go mbeidh an tuarascáil seo á leagadh faoi bhráid an Rialtais.</P>
      <P>Tá fhios agam go bhfuil an-obair ar bun. Tá sé beagán níos faide ná mar a shíl muid ach tá fhios ag chuile dhuine sa Ghaeltacht an méid oibre agus an méid dua atá á chaitheamh leis seo, an spéis atá ag an bpobal ann agus an tábhachtach a bhaineann, mar shampla, leis na haighneachtaí agus na cruinnithe poiblí. Ta súil agam gur féidir linn dul chun cinn scioptha a dhéanamh agus cinnte dearfa an rún a bhí agamsa ó thús go deireadh ná go mbeadh an tuarascáil foilsithe go maith in am don Rialtas seo le cinneadh a dhéanamh air agus le tosú a bheith déanta ar é a fheidhmiú. Ní féidir liom dul níos faide ná sin inniu ceal tuarascáil a bheith ar fáil.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, tá moltaí go leor curtha ar aghaidh don Choimisiún go dtí seo sna haighneachtaí a déanadh. Ó tharla nach bhfuil fhios againn go fóill cén uair a bheidh an tuairisc á chur i bhfeidhm an bhféadfaí tuairisc idirlíne nó idir ama, interim report, a chur ar fáil faoi na moltaí fiúntacha seo? Tá géarchéim ó thaobh na Gaeilge de sa Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire. An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit iarraidh ar an gCoimisún an tuairisc idirlíne seo a chur ar fáil go bhfeicfimid na tuairimí a bheidh ann agus <Col N="731" /> b'fhéidir, iarracht a dhéanamh iad a chur i bhfeidhm láithreach?</P>
      <P>An bhfuil an Coimisiún ag déanamh scrúdú ar na ceantair imeallaithe Gaeltachta, ceantair atá díreach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ach go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ann? An féidir pacáiste de chineál éigin do na ceantair sin a chur le chéile chun iad a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht, chun an Ghaeltacht a láidriú, a dhaingniú agus a dhéanamh níos téagartha?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Maidir leis an chéad cheist, cinnte déanfaidh mé machnamh ar an cheist sin agus arís beidh an cinneadh a dhéanfaidh mé bunaithe ar an leas is fearr ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de go fad téarmach chomh fada agus a fheictear domsa é.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, chuir mé scéimeanna áirithe i bhfeidhm cheana féin, mar shampla, scéim na gcúntóirí teanga, gan aon tuarascáil mar shíl mé gur ghá brú ar aghaidh leo sin agus nach bhféadfadh éinne a rá nach rud tairbheach a bheadh ann. Is féidir iad a mhúnlú agus a mhéadú má mholann an tuarascáil é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Maidir le teorannacha na Gaeltachta, tá ceist an-mhaith ardaithe ag an Teachta. Feictear domsa, áfach, go bhfuil an contúirt ann gurb é an rud a tharlódh sa deireadh ná an Ghaeltacht a chúngú agus a bhriseadh ar an mbealach sin. Mar sin, feictear domsa go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbreathnódh an Coimisiún ar an cheist seo faoi theorannacha na Gaeltachta ar chuile bhealach agus ar bhealach chomh scaoilte agus chomh hoscailte agus is féidir agus go mbreathnóidís go leathan ar na himpleachtaí teanga a bheadh ann le polasaithe éagsúla. Tá sé mar cheann de na critéir go gcaithfidh siad moltaí a dhéanamh maidir leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta ag tógáil mar shampla san áireamh ceantair nádúrtha scoile. Is cuid an-tábhachtach de obair an Choimisiúin na moltaí faoi theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Questions No. 766 of 7 November 2000 and No. 96 of 14 November 2000 from Deputy Clune.</P>
      <P>My Department recently engaged the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out as a matter of urgency an independent and objective analysis of the submission made by RTE for an increase in the television licence fee. When I receive the consultant's report I will give the matter careful consideration. It is too early to say when I will be in a position to bring proposals to Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any time limit on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report? Is there a deadline by which it must be returned to the Minister? Does the Minister intend to announce a decision when the Dáil is in recess when there cannot be any response from the other side of the House, and has she reached any preliminary decision at this stage? Does she intend not to give an increase, to give the full increase or something in between? Can she indicate to the House whether she has any considered view on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see this matter, particularly the consultant's work come to fruition as quickly as possible. I look on it as a matter of urgency. Once I have the information to hand, I will make my own appraisal of it. If I consider that it warrants an increase in the licence fee then I must bring it to Government and get the support of the Minister for Finance and the Government in the usual way. As the Deputy is aware, that is the usual way to respond to such an issue.</P>
      <P>He asked me if I have any preliminary ideas about the kind of an increase I would be likely to entertain or whether I am in a position to entertain any increase at all. I would not engage a firm to look at this submission unless I wanted to ensure there had been a proper and objective evaluation of the submission that is to hand. The case presented by RTE must be seen to stand up under objective independent evaluation. RTE would welcome evaluation and has made that statement publicly.</P>
      <P>It is important to have a strong public service broadcasting element here. It is axiomatic that the organisation charged with delivering this service is adequately funded and properly organised. It would be foolish for me, having engaged a firm to evaluate the submission, to come to any conclusion before that expert advice was available to me. I do not wish this to be put on the long finger and I have asked for an urgent response from the consultants. I look forward to their evaluation and I will then act on that after due consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the consultants to report before the end of the year or before next Easter? Can the Minister give us any indication of a time frame? Does she agree that if this were to drag on and on it would be totally unfair to the RTE authority because whatever her decision may be, RTE needs to know what increase it will get, or if it is to get an increase at all, so it can plan and develop in the very challenging era facing it? We know there are many internal problems there. My most important question is when exactly will the consultants' report be available? Can the Minister give us a guarantee that the consultants will report before the end of January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be able to have some information from the consultants at that stage. As this is a matter of urgency I do not want any undue delays. I want a proper evaluation and I <Col N="733" /> am concerned that would be done well and efficiently. I believe this will be done by the consultants who have taken on this job and I hope by January to have some indication if not the full report.</P>

      <P>A programme of acquisition of bogland for conservation purposes from Bord na Móna commenced prior to the transfer of certain responsibilities to my Department from Office of Public Works. Since 1996 my Department has continued this programme.</P>
      <P>At the outset these lands had been acquired by Bord na Móna for development. The lands were subsequently proposed for designation as special areas of conservation pursuant to the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive, or as natural heritage areas. I will circulate in the Official Report a schedule of the relevant acquisitions since 1996 giving details as required by the Deputy. I am aware of the contention by some of the original land owners that there was an agreement between them and Bord na Móna that the land would be returned to them in the event that it was not developed by Bord na Móna. This is a matter between Bord na Móna and the landowners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is unsatisfactory. How did it come about that lands originally intended to go back to the land owners were designated as being special areas of conservation? The agreement to return the land to the land owners can be verified by personnel in Bord na Móna who are prepared to verify that a verbal agreement was made that the land would be returned in the event that Bord na Móna did not want to develop it. Did money change hands with regard to the transfer of this land from Bord na Móna to Dúchas and if so, what was the source of funding for that transfer? How can Dúchas or the Department have any credibility, if the Department moved in without the land owners or the bog owners in this instance, having the first choice to regain the land as in the undertaking given initially, that if development was not to take place it would be returned to them? Perhaps the Minister could give me all correspondence in relation to an agreement or any correspondence between Bord na Móna and Dúchas on the whole <Col N="734" /> question of acquisition of boglands. There are two major areas and many other smaller ones besides. However, on Mount Bellew in my constituency and in Clara, extensive areas have been acquired in this fashion. We do not know how. In the interests of transparency, it is incumbent on the Minister to come up with answers because there are suspicions and the bog owners are deeply concerned and have been for many years. They are being brushed aside with vague answers. Deputy O'Rourke is on record as stating that the bogs were handed over. Were they handed over by Bord na Móna thus breaking the agreements initially entered into or did money change hands?</P>

      <P>I will circulate in the Official Report a schedule of the relevant acquisitions since 1996 giving the details required by the Deputy. The contention of some of the original landowners that there was an agreement between them and Bord na Móna is a matter for them and Bord na Móna. I understand Bord na Móna has taken legal advice and is satisfied it is entitled to dispose of the lands. I am advised that the Chief State Solicitor is satisfied that good title has been acquired by the State.</P>

Tá go leor de na comhairlí contae ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile nach gcuireann isteach na billí go dtí an noiméad deiridh. Bheadh comhairlí contae ann a bhfuil go leor airgid ceadaithe dóibh ach nach bhfuil sé caite fós acu mar nach bhfuil na seiceanna scríofa, nach bhfuil an caiteachas ceadaithe agus nach bhfuil an obair scrúdaithe go deiridh. Cuirfear an t-eolas go dtí an Teachta.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh go leor obair ar fhoireann na Roinn leis seo agus b'fhéidir gurb é a bhí ag teastáil ón dTeachta ná an caiteachas faoi Scéim na bhFeabhsúchán Gaeltachta, nó céard a ceadaíodh. Arbh é sin a bhí ón Teachta? Más ea, is féidir an cheist a fhreagairt go simplí.</P>
      <P>Ó thaobh na mbóithre straitéiseacha, mar a mhínigh mé go poiblí cheana, ceadaíodh £1.2 milliún i dTír Chonaill, agus £250,000 i Muigh Eo. Ceadaíodh £1.5 milliún i nGaillimh, £800,000 i gCiarraí, £500,000 i gCorcaigh. Níor ceadaíodh dada i mbliana faoi Scéim na mBóithre Straitéiseacha i bPort Láirge ná i gContae na Mí.</P>

Dá dtarlódh sé, agus níl a fhios agam conas mar a sheasann rudaí ansin inniu, nach raibh aon airgead íoctha amach i gContae na Gaillimhe, mar nach raibh an caiteachas déanta i gContae na Gaillimhe fós, thaispeánfadh sé nach raibh aon chaiteachas déanta i gContae na Gaillimhe.

      <Quest>the implications of the judgment of the European Court on 8 November 2000 that member states must submit an exhaustive list of sites for protection to the European Commission; if she will review the list of SACs submitted to the Commission; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The judgment to which the Deputy refers was made on the 7 November 2000. The judgment does not state that an exhaustive list of sites is to be submitted to the EU Commission. It states:</P>
      <P>On a proper construction of Article 4(1) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, a Member State may not take account of economic, social and cultural requirements or regional and local characteristics, as mentioned in Article 2(3) of that directive, when selecting and defining the boundaries of the sites to be proposed to the Commission as eligible for identification as sites of Community importance.</P>
      <P>The judgment has no new implications for Ireland. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, already interpreted the directive in this way. Economic, social and cultural requirements or regional or local characteristics were not taken into account by Dúchas when selecting and defining sites or their boundaries. Accordingly the Irish selection procedures comply with this judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification because reports did not indicate it in that fashion. Is the list of SACs closed? Will the Minister add to that list at this juncture? What is the time limit here? At what date will the Commission say the list must be submitted and that we cannot add to it? The Minister said the judgment has no implications for Ireland. For all that, what is the exact position in regard to deadlines and the comprehensive and full list of SACs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish list of sites was found to be insufficient at the Atlantic regional bio-geographical seminar held in September 1999. This insufficiency was based on the fact that the published sites had not yet been transmitted to the <Col N="738" /> EU Commission. We have had numerous discussions in the House on why it was important to go through the procedures the Minister of State and I set up in the Department to ensure people had an opportunity to put their point of view on the site proposed. I expect the Irish list will be found sufficient at the next seminar in September 2001 because all the sites have been transmitted since the end of November.</P>
      <P>The conservation organisations have produced proposals for additional SACs and, as I have said on numerous occasions, we, in the Department, look at these proposals very seriously. Some of their proposals have already been included in the Department's list. The Department is examining the different proposals that have been put to us in regard to the possibility of additional sites. Obviously, if it finds that additional sites are required in order to comply with the directive, that will be done in accordance with the procedures we have set down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>On the number of sites that have been submitted by the Government, the Minister mentioned that the conservation groups, the NGOs, have their own list which I gather comprises a greater number of sites than originally submitted. Will the Minister indicate the number of sites the Government has submitted, the number submitted by the NGOs and the difference between those two groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the NGOs have put forward certain proposals in regard to additional sites. Many of the proposals the NGOs put forward are already incorporated into the Department's list. All of the sites were submitted to Europe by the end of November. I do not have the exact number here but it is well in excess of 300 sites.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clune asked a strange question when she asked about the difference in terms of numbers between the sites proposed by the NGOs and the number of sites we put to Europe. It is not a question of numbers &ndash; it is a question of the quality of the sites, the scientific value of the sites and the need to conserve the different habitats and ecologies of those sites. We have complied with the EU in regard to putting forward the number of sites. We have done so in the fairest way possible given the habitats directive. Obviously, this situation is ongoing and will continue to be considered by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question specifically asked if the list would be reviewed. Given what the Minister said about the economic and socio-economic situation, will she confirm that Greece and Italy got a derogation in regard to those sites on economic grounds? They said the designation proposals were encroaching on the production of tobacco? It is a bit contradictory that they got a derogation for this economic activity but that we cannot get one for our people. There is a concentration of SACs in the west. There should be a <Col N="739" /> list of priority sites and, if the list was exhaustive, those sites could be spread nationally rather than what has happened. It is clear there is an over abundance of these sites in the west. There is not an equal spread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in reply to the last speaker, Deputy Clune, that this matter is ongoing because we know of the interest among NGOs and others who would put forward different suggestions to the Department. Those proposals will be considered very carefully. I expect the Irish list will be found sufficient when the next biogeographical seminar takes place in September 2001.</P>

      <P>I attended a formal meeting of the EU Culture Council in Brussels on 23 November last. The main items on the agenda relating to audio-visual matters were the adoption of a common position on the proposed training programme for professionals in the European audio-visual programme industry, otherwise known as MEDIA-training, and securing political agreement on the proposed MEDIA Plus programme to encourage the development, distribution and promotion of European audio-visual works. My concern in the negotiations was the achievement of a satisfactory allocation of resources to the development section of the MEDIA Plus programme and I am satisfied we achieved this objective.</P>
      <P>There was also an important political discussion on the future of public broadcasting in the course of which member states confirmed the importance that is attached to this system in the current environment.</P>
      <P>On the agenda relating to culture affairs, there was a number of important items for discussion. The Council discussed and adopted a resolution on architectural quality in urban and rural environments. The resolution encourages member states to improve the knowledge and promotion of architecture and urban design and to make contracting authorities and the general public more aware of and better trained in appreciation of architectural, urban and cultural landscape.</P>
      <P>The Council also adopted a resolution on fixed book pricing which is operated by a number of EU member states. The Council agreed the two Council members for the expert panel for the capital of Europe in 2005 which is the year that Ireland has the right to make nominations for the designation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the MEDIA Plus programme is very useful. Because of the Irish stance on this proposal it was possible to secure agreement on this programme and bring the issue to a satisfactory conclusion. My particular concern in the negotiations was the achievement of a satisfactory allocation of resources to the development section of the MEDIA Plus programme. I was satisfied that we achieved the objective. The initial response by the Commission of an allocation of 64 million ecu was increased to 70 million ecu. I put forward a proposal that the repayment of loans for development under MEDIA II estimated at some 6 million ecu to 9 million ecu would be allocated, having regard to the needs of the class of operations which generated these returns. This compromise in the form of a Commission declaration was accepted and on this basis the programme was agreed. Given that the matter was being negotiated for a long time I was pleased to be able to bring this about. I wanted to put the emphasis on the importance of the development section and that was agreed.</P>

      <P>The restoration work on All Hallow's College comprises in the main work on the library and the archives. The amount allocated in the budget to All Hallow's College is £50,000, not £0.5 million as referred to by the Deputy. I intend to ask the Heritage Council to administer these funds on behalf of my Department. As the Deputies are aware, the Government has also announced support of £0.2 million in the budget for the Irish College in Rome, to be administered by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>This assistance is provided on a once-off basis for each of these projects. The Government decided to mark the contribution of Christian churches in Ireland during the millennium celebrations. It was considered appropriate to do this by assisting the restoration of the buildings concerned. These buildings are important elements of our architectural heritage and are deserving of protection in their own right. Each has a special significance and that has been recognised by providing assistance on a once-off basis to deal with the structural repairs outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the allocations are welcome. However, the reason these projects were selected rather than others is not clear. Is there any proposal to extend this provision in the future? In the context of these important historical churches they should be kept in the best possible state of repair. Whether it is the library in All Hallow's College or the organ in St. Aidan's Cathedral, these should be refurbished and kept in good condition. It is not a good idea to just make a millennium gesture. I ask for a commit<Col N="742" /> ment that this type of funding will be provided in future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy would consider it appropriate to honour some of the outstanding examples of our architectural heritage, the Christian churches, during the millennium celebrations. That was the main reason for assisting these projects at this time. The question of assistance to churches came up in a number of debates here. It is one of the issues that will be discussed at length with regard to the review of the monuments Acts. It is an issue that could be widened. I look forward to the debate when there will be an opportunity to discuss those issues. These are once-off payments. While we would wish to provide funding on an on-going basis, we have to ensure such funding is not in breach of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could clarify this for the Deputy. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that for State funding to constitute endowment of a religion it must have three characteristics, one of which is that it must be permanent. That is the reason this is a once-off payment on this occasion to these particular churches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support the whole thrust of what the Minister has said, and the review of the monuments Acts and so on is welcome, certain churches that become redundant can quickly fall into a poor state of repair and can be seriously damaged. Will the Minister look at a proposal to put a contingency fund in place so that her Department would be in a position to assist repair work to retain the integrity of the particular building and its artifacts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views expressed. Given that there are so many places of worship that are of particular interest not only from an historical point of view but from an architectural point of view, the question of deciding on what projects should be addressed is one we face in the Department. We are lucky to have such a wealth of buildings that should be looked after and preserved and conserved. Some of these buildings are held in private ownership and some have been taken over by the State.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if a contingency fund would be the right approach. That would make it look as if, rather than prioritising buildings of a historic nature in the Department, money for them would have to be shared out of a small contingency fund. That should not be the approach. We need a much broader based approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we can further this debate when we have an opportunity to discuss what we propose to do in regard to the review of the monuments Acts. I hope to have a discussion paper early next <Col N="743" /> year on the issues that will arise in the review of those Acts.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 10, 16 agus 33 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá téarmaí tagartha leathan tugtha ag an Rialtas don Choimisiún faoin Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Ar dtús thug an Coimisiún cuireadh poiblí don phobal i gcoitinne tuairimí agus moltaí i scríbhinn a sheoladh chuige. Tuigim go bhfuil os cionn céad aighneacht ón bpobal faighte ag an gCoimisiún go dtí seo. Chomh maith leis sin tá an Coimisiún ag eagrú sraith cruinnithe oscailte ar fud na Gaeltachta agus taobh amuigh di chun seans a thabhairt don phobal tuilleadh tuairimí agus moltaí ó bhéal a chur ar aghaidh. Táthar ag súil leis go mbeidh an próiseas chomhairlithe seo críochnaithe go luath i 2001. Ar ndóigh freisin tá a lán eolas breise le bailiú ag an gCoimisiún agus tuigim go mbeidh Comhairleoirí gairmiúla ag cabhrú leis sa ghné sin den obair. Bheadh súil agam go mbeadh Tuarascáil an Choimisiúin ar fáil don Rialtas roimh dheireadh 2001.</P>
      <P>Tá sé mar ceann de Théarmaí Tagartha an Choimisiúin scrúdú agus anailís a dhéanamh ar na tosca agus ar na polasaithe gur cosúil atá chun leas nó chun dochar chaomhnú na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Tá na meáin áirithe sa scrúdú sin. Bheadh suim agam a fháil amach cad díreach atá i gceist ag an Teachta le go gcuirfinn a bhfuil ar intinn aige faoi bhráid an Choimisiúin le scrúdú. Beidh an díospóireacht a bheidh ar bun agam le hAirí Rialtais eile maidir le polasaí straitéiseach don Ghaeilge á ndíriú sa bhliain 2001 ar an Scéim Ghinearálta den Bhille Comhionannais um Theangacha Oifigiúla atá á hullmhú faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá iarrtha freisin ar Choimisiún na Gaeltachta anailís a dhéanamh ar a mhéid atá an Ghaeilge in úsáid mar theanga labhartha sna limistéir Ghaeltachta éagsúla. Beidh ról an phobail taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht i mbuanú agus i gcaomhnú na teanga sa Ghaeltacht le cur san áire<Col N="744" /> amh i moltaí an Choimisiúin. Ar ndóigh ní bheadh an Coimisiún seo ann ach go bhfeiceann an Rialtas go bhfuil gá an Ghaeilge a láidriú mar theanga labhartha sa Ghaeltacht. Tá an Coimisiún ag obair go stuama faoi láthair agus ní mór dúinn fanacht anois ar thuarascáil uathu.</P>

      <P>Chuala mé an freagra ar fad ach ní raibh sé ar an bpointe, mar a déarfá. Tá na meáin chumarsáide ann agus tá Gaeilge á craoladh ag cuid acu agus níl aon chomhordnú lárnach eatarthu i dtaobh na gclár atá ag dul amach. Nílim ag caint mar gheall ar neamhspleáchas RTE nó Network 2 nó TG4 nó TV3 a laghdú in aon slí. Ach ceapaim níos mó tairbhe le craoladh na Gaeilge dá mbeadh plean straitéiseach ann agus é sin aontaithe ag na craoltóirí éagsúla i dtreo is nach mbeadh siad go léir ag déanamh an rud céanna.</P>
      <P>Níl mórán Gaeilge ag teacht ó TV3, cuirim i gcás ach iarraim ar an Aire Stáit an aontaíonn sé go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh beartas comhaontaithe craolacháin sa tír seo i dtaobh na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Ó thaobh na meán cumarsáide ná déanaimis dearmad go bhfuil Raidió na Life, TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta ann. Tá siadsan mar chrann taca don chraoladh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Glacaim leis gurb éard atá i gceist ag an Teachta ná mar shampla na stáisiúin neamhspleácha agus mar sin de mar dualgas i leith na Gaeilge leagtha síos sa reachtaíocht do RTE agus ní gá níos mó a rá faoi sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí áthas orm an tseachtain seo caite gur láinseáil mé tuarascáil a bhí réitithe ag an bhForas Teanga, Gael-linn agus na stáisiúin tráchtála. Tháinig siad le chéile chun an cheist seo a phlé agus le rud éigin a dhéanamh maidir le craoladh trí Ghaeilge ar na stáisiúin sin. Ar ndóigh, is stáisiúin tráchtála iad agus caithfidh siad súil a choinneáil ar an margadh ach tá áthas orm go bhfeiceann na stáisiúin sin go bhfuil lucht labhartha na Gaeilge mar chuid den mhargadh sin, bíodh siad sa Ghaeltachta nó taobh amuigh de, agus go bhfuil siad ag teacht le chéile le comhoibriú an Fhorais Theanga ar an ábhar atá luaite ag an Teachta.</P>

      <P>Tá an-mheas agam féin ar an méid atá á dhéanamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4 maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeltacht. Ach tá sé tábhachtach plean de chineál éigin a bheith againn agus go leagfaí síos caighdeán áirithe ag an bpointe seo. Tá deis ag TG4 agus go mór mór Raidió na Gaeltachta eiseamlár de chaighdeán Gaeilge a leagadh síos don Ghaeilge labhartha sa tír seo mar atá leagtha síos, más <Col N="745" /> ceadmhach dom a rá, ag an BBC i gcás an Bhéarla. Tá canúintí Béarla ar fud na Breataine Móire ach tá caighdeán leagtha síos ag an BBC.</P>
      <P>D'fhéadfadh na craoltóirí gairmiúla ar Raidió na Gaeltachta é sin a dhéanamh agus b'fhiú painéal éisteoirí a bhunú ar fud na tíre a d'éistfeadh go rialta agus go laethúil le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus le TG4 agus go ndéanfadh siad moltaí faoi chúrsaí canúna agus caighdeáin sa dóigh go mbeadh an caighdeán céanna ag gach duine atá ag labhairt go gairmiúil ar Raidió na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Níl a fhios agam an leanann an tAire Stáit an méid atá á rá agam ach tá sé in am dúinn é sin a dhéanamh anois. Éistim le Raidió na Gaeltachta go minic agus is minic a bhíonn leaganach difriúla ag craoltóirí gairmiúla, mar shampla deir cuid acu bainisteoir na contae, deir cuid eile foireann an chontae, deir daoine eile rúnaí an chontae agus daoine eile bainisteoir an chontae. Ba cheart caighdeán a leagadh síos agus úsáid a bhaint as Raidió na Gaeltachta go mór chun é sin a dhéanamh. Seo rud a d'fhéadfadh Údarás nó Comhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta breathnú isteach ann. Caithfidh caighdeán ceart gramadaí Gaeilge a bheith againn agus níl sé sin ar fáil i láthair na huaire.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist an-bhunúsach ardaithe ag an Teachta, sé sin cé leagfaidh síos an caighdeán scríofa agus an caighdeán labhartha. Ceist í sin atá á scrúdú agam i láthair na huaire mar tagann sé i gceist leis an mBille Teanga. Má táimid ag dul cáipéis ar fáil trí Ghaeilge, caithfimid a shocrú cén cineál Gaeilge a bheas ann. Caithfimid a bheith cúramach go mbeidh caighdeán solúbtha ann a thabharfaidh saoirse ag na canúintí fad atá siad dílis don traidisiún feidhmiú taobh istigh de na canúintí. Mar shampla tá brí éagsúil iomlán ag muintir Thír Chonaill le &ldquo;galánta&rdquo; agus atá ag muintir Chonamara. Is deas an rud a bheith galánta i dTír Chonaill ach ní deas an rud é i gConamara. Úsáidtear an focal &ldquo;beirt&rdquo; i ndhá chomhthéacs éagsúil ar fad i dTír Chonaill agus i gConamara. Ní drochrud é sin.</P>
      <P>Tá, áfach, nósanna teanga ag teacht isteach atá glan in aghaidh aon chaighdeán Gaeilge a bhí ann ariamh, mar shampla &lsquo;t' a úsáid roimh ghuta  &ndash; an Aire in ionad an tAire. Tá sé sin mícheart agus ní luíonn sé le haon chanúint. Caithfimid caighdeán a leagadh síos agus féachaint chuige go gcloítear go hoifigiúil leis ag dreamanna atá ag plé leis an nGaeilge go gairmiúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chuige sin ní mór go mbeadh údarás agus cúram ar dhream éigin bheith i mbun an chaighdeáin. Cheana féin tá ceist téarmaíochta agus foclóireachta leagtha ar an bhForas Teanga agus b'fhéidir go luíonn sé le réasún go leagfaí ceist an chaighdeáin orthu freisin. Táim á scrúdú, is gá é a dhéanamh agus nuair atá sé aontaithe bheadh dream éigin ar nós an raidió nó ar nós na teilifíse a mbeidh sé de chúram orthu cloí leis sin agus é a chur i láthair an phobail agus nós ceart labhartha a chothú i measc an phobail. Ba é an trua é an Ghaeilge a mhilleadh. Is teanga an-bhreá í agus ba é an peaca í a mhilleadh trí ligean don chaighdeán sleamhnú. Ní ghlacfaimid leis sa <Col N="746" /> Bhéarla nó sa bhFraincis agus cén fáth a nglacfaimis leis sa Ghaeilge?</P>

    <P>Information regarding land acquisitions by the national monuments and historic properties and other sections of Dúchas is not readily available but is being collected and will be sent directly to the Deputy. I am satisfied that Dúchas has the manpower, competence and experience to manage these lands properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The land bank owned by Dúchas covers a huge area. The personnel in Dúchas are scientists, professional people and there has been a failure by them to recognise that the landowners and the general population have protected the wild life, habitats, etc. We have an abundance of habitats because they were managed by the people working on the ground, be they farmers or otherwise. Dúchas has failed in the past to recognise this and it is now imposing restrictions. They are unnecessary because huge numbers of farmers are becoming involved in the REP scheme.</P>

      <P>Is there recognition within Dúchas that the landowners and the general population have the capacity to preserve and conserve our habitats? There has been a failure by Dúchas in this regard because of its scientific bias and its belief that it is the only body with the capacity to preserve and conserve.</P>

      <P>The Deputy acknowledges that there are professional people in Dúchas. They have specific knowledge and expertise which they make available. On many occasions, including when I sat on the opposite side of the House, the Minister of State and I have been at pains to <Col N="749" /> acknowledge that landowners and users have ensured the preservation and conservation of our habitats. This is recognised by Dúchas. It works on the ground with local people.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said Dúchas is placing restrictions on landowners and users. No doubt he has in mind the special areas of conservation, which come under the scope of an EU directive. That has been transposed into Irish law and must be complied with. My approach &ndash; and that of the Minister of State &ndash;  is to try to find consensus. It is important we get the agreement of people at local level and we are achieving that. The fact that this Administration has managed to recruit rangers from people on the ground shows we know that the importance of local knowledge and co-operation with landowners is imperative for the continued conservation of our habitats.</P>

      <P>A record of monuments and places under section 12 of the National Monuments Acts has been established in respect of ancient monuments for all counties throughout the State and is available for inspection by members of the public at various venues, mainly local authority planning offices, public libraries and museums, farm development service and Teagasc offices during normal, public opening hours. The record of monuments and places consists of a set of constraint maps based on current <Col N="750" /> 6 inch Ordnance Survey mapping with an accompanying index giving location details, national grid co-ordinates, townland name or street name and monument classification. The records cover approximately 120,000 sites.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of recorded monuments are in private care and my Department manages about 740 national monuments and historic properties nationwide. Representative samples of these sites are chosen for presentation to the public. Details of these are published annually as a booklet which is furnished to the tourist trade and heritage cardholders and Members of the Oireachtas. The current booklet includes information on over 100 heritage locations including parks, gardens, waterways, monuments, nature reserves and cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey of architectural heritage is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within a period of 12 years.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more that it is most important we ensure that young people especially have an interest in, knowledge of and access to our heritage. Given this, I have ensured that all school children on school trips to different locations throughout the country have free access to the centres in question. The booklet to which I have referred gives an excellent summary of the sites that are available. The information services in my Department rightly prides itself on the work it is doing to disseminate it, not only to schools but to the public. We have also been able to greatly improve the information services at our sites by way of interpretation. I set up the Ceol Reoite project in the Department to heighten the awareness of and to promote some of our most famous national monuments and important sites. In doing so, I hoped to encourage our young artistic talent by marrying pieces of music and the architecture involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>The ASTI campaign of industrial action in pursuit of its pay claim for an immediate 30% increase in salary has resulted in the majority of second level students losing nine days teaching in the past month. This is a significant portion of the total annual teaching time, the loss of which is adversely affecting all students, particularly those sitting examinations this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ASTI decision to escalate the industrial action to include further strike days and the ban on co-operation with leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations is difficult to understand, particularly when the decision came immediately at the end of a week in which the improved terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, together with the budget tax con<Col N="752" /> cessions, were accepted by the other public service unions, including the other two teacher unions. It is most regrettable that the ASTI has now decided to hold the futures of our children to ransom in pursuit of its pay claim.</P>
    <P>I met the ASTI on Monday, 4 December. This was in direct response to numerous public statements from the ASTI seeking to meet me and the clear expression by both the Taoiseach and me of our willingness to listen to its views. The ASTI position is that the industrial action can be suspended only when a special forum is provided to address its claim over and above and ahead of the claims of other public service employees. The ASTI also reiterated that the public service benchmarking body is not an adequate body to address its claim and that it would not participate in that body.</P>
    <P>I was most disappointed with the ASTI position which did not acknowledge the truth of the situation in relation to the processing of its claim. Procedures have been established and agreed between the teacher unions and the Department. These include negotiation within the Teachers' Conciliation Council and, ultimately, referral to an independent three person Teachers' Arbitration Board. In this instance, the ASTI asked that its claim be referred to the Teachers' Arbitration Board which, it agreed, was the appropriate body to deal with its claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Teachers' Arbitration Board rejected the ASTI 30% claim and recommended that the pay terms of the PPF should be applied to ASTI members in common with other teachers and public servants. It also recommended that its further concerns should be addressed through the public service benchmarking body. The board further stated that it did not believe that &ldquo;it would be appropriate for it to determine the pay for one particular group of workers outside the norms which have been accepted by the majority <Col N="753" /> of workers having regard to all the consequences which could flow from such a course of action&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why the ASTI continues to reject the public service benchmarking body as being inadequate to deal with its concerns. This is an independent forum presided over by a High Court judge whose composition, terms of reference and secretariat have been agreed between the social partners. Its terms of reference, including the in-depth and comprehensive research, examination and analysis of pay rates across the public and private sectors as well as particular occupational groups and graduate recruits are tailor made to deal with the issue raised by the ASTI.</P>
      <P>The public service benchmarking body is also required in its recommendations to have regard to the need to recruit, retain, motivate and reward staff with the qualifications and skills needed to exercise their different responsibilities and to ensure equity between employees in the public and private sector. As these are the issues of concern to the ASTI, it becomes difficult to understand why it refuses to see the independent benchmarking process as a way forward.</P>
      <P>The improved pay terms of the PPF and the associated early settlers agreement for ASTI members mean a cumulative pay increase of almost 22% within a two year period, beginning with a 8.5% increase effective from 1 October last and paid to all teachers from that date. The PPF also provides for significant tax concessions in the region of 10%. The budget has already delivered significantly on this commitment. The PPF tax concessions, taken together with the pay increases, amount to a 32% increase in take home pay.</P>

      <P>These are substantial increases in pay over a 25-month period.</P>
      <P>In addition to these guaranteed improvements, teachers will also be able to process their case for a further pay increase through the public service benchmarking body, which has been established to undertake a fundamental examination of public service jobs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. The improved terms of the PPF agreed last week now provide that one quarter of any further increase arising from the report of the benchmarking body will be implemented with effect from 1 December next, thus fast tracking payment.</P>
      <P>The ASTI objectives can be achieved most effectively and equitably through the processes included in the PPF and agreed through the social partnership process which has delivered our present state of economic wellbeing. There is still time for this dispute to be resolved before the effects of the escalation of industrial action by the ASTI impact fully on the examination system and the students who are currently preparing for their examinations.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the ASTI on Tuesday outlining my views and inviting it to meet me so that we can find a way to resolve this dispute in a mutually acceptable and satisfactory way in the interests of pupils and parents. I am pleased to report that the ASTI has accepted my invitation and a meeting is being arranged.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is more of the Woods waffle. He said last week that he was shocked at the response of the ASTI central executive. The Taoiseach said yesterday that he was at a loss to understand what the strike is about. I am very concerned that students who are now in the most pressurised year of their lives, with their futures depending on their examination results, are being used as pawns in the war between the Department and the ASTI. I am absolutely astounded at the lack of creativity and imagination shown by the Minister in letting the strike escalate to this point. If the Minister and the ASTI want to have talks, will the Minister say if a definite date been arranged for the meeting <Col N="755" /> to which he referred in his letter last Tuesday? When the Minister meets the ASTI, is he prepared to announce an independent commission on teaching to deal with the complexities of the teaching profession across all sectors, which would allow observer status to unions currently within the PPF? Is he prepared to show some imagination in this instance in that most teachers I know now wish to get back to work, and most parents are extremely concerned about a situation which has drifted to a point of outright confrontation, principally because of the Minister's lack of imagination, action and creativity? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The day before last, I invited the ASTI to meet me. It replied that it was prepared to have discussions and a meeting is being arranged. As the Deputy will appreciate, the members are on strike today so a meeting will be held as soon as possible. I certainly hope to have a meeting within days.</P>
      <P>On the independent commission, an independent body will look at teachers' positions, as well as the position of others. That body is very capable and is presided over by a totally independent judge. We should be clear about that aspect. I will be happy to make any arrangements in the context of the PPF and the other teacher unions. I am open to discussions on how we might find a solution. An article in one of this morning's newspapers by the general secretary of the ASTI, on its behalf, stated that the ASTI is now looking for a forum, independent of the Government and independent of influences which are compromised by connections with the PPF, to address its claim. The whole country is working on the PPF and an independent body and independent forum is in place. I will be very happy to facilitate any arrangements made within that forum to address the issues. It is neither realistic nor factual to suggest that the bodies involved in the PPF are in any way compromised or that people can be compromised by connection with the PPF. There is an independent forum in place and we will discuss the means by which we might advance the position. However, I must make it clear that the Government and I stand very firmly with the partners and the PPF.</P>

It was the ASTI's understanding that he would revert to it by last Friday. Will he accept that his failure to do so has resulted in the escalation of the dispute? Rather than availing of the opportunity, the Minister allowed matters to drift. Is it the case that the Minister's inaction, apparent lack of any kind of interest in the dispute and his confrontational approach have greatly exacerbated the dispute? <Col N="756" /> Is it the case that the Minister is part of the problem?</P>

      <P>The Deputy was engaged in this House in discussing the points raised by the ASTI during my last meeting with it. It said the claim is based on payment for productivity, an adjustment to close the gap which has developed between the salaries of teachers and other comparable graduate groups, cost of living increases and on a share in economic prosperity. It made clear from the outset that it did not like two aspects of the benchmarking process. It believes it is not fast enough. It wants an advance payment on it soon and it wanted the increase in inflation to be dealt with in the current year. In addition, it wanted the increase in inflation to be dealt with in the current year.</P>

      <P>The ASTI referred to pay. It stated that its claim is based on payment for productivity, closing the gap with other sectors, the cost of living and obtaining a share in economic prosperity. Those four points were contained in the document the ASTI presented to me at that stage.</P>
      <P>The social partners dealt with those issues last week. On Saturday I was hopeful that the ASTI would recognise that the Government and social partners had met its demands and that the PPF provided, through the benchmarking mechanism, an opportunity to process its further claims. However, the union refused to recognise that. I wrote to it afterwards setting out what were the benefits which emerged from the budget. Everybody in the country recognised those benefits&mdash;</P>

Does he also accept that the ASTI dispute involves more issues than a mere pay claim? Has any work been carried out in drawing up the possible terms of reference of the teaching commission which, in my opinion, holds the key to resolving this dispute? Is the Minister in a position to inform the House about this little known PR committee comprising officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Science and Finance which is responsible for dealing with the media in respect of this dispute? What is that committee's role and will the Minister override it to ensure a resolution is reached?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that initially benchmarking was a new concept which related primarily to pay. The teachers requested a comparison with the private sector because employees in that sector are doing well at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to the wider issues, I am extremely interested in developing and supporting the education system and the teaching profession. I am currently working with teachers in that regard. Deputies must remember that there are two teacher unions participating in discussions on those matters and in the PPF. Those unions have expressed satisfaction with what the PPF has delivered to date and are making preparations to put forward a wide-ranging promotion of their position to the benchmarking body.</P>
      <P>In relation to the committee to which Deputy Sargent referred, representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Science and Finance are working together to try to find a resolution to this dispute.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the rhythm of the educational semester has been completely disrupted because of the strike? How does he propose to run the State examinations &ndash; which is his legal responsibility &ndash; in a fair manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting that the PPF be broken or breached. Does the Minister not accept that the appointment of a commission on teaching would deal with a great number of common prob<Col N="758" /> lems which are of concern to all teacher unions? Does he accept that, because the main benchmarking process is dealing with issues and difficulties affecting 235,000 public servants, the many complex matters that have arisen in the education sector since this strike began would be best dealt with by an independent commission on teaching which would have strong links with the PPF? Does he not see the value in proceeding in that manner?</P>

      <P>I am anxious to find a means to resolve that situation but the Deputy must realise that, as matters stand, the executive of the ASTI, and no one else, decided to increase the pressure by launching an attack on the examinations process. It is obvious that there will be difficulties in running the examinations but we will have to deal with that issue, if it arises, after Christmas. I stated at the time that I was shocked because I did not believe that teachers or the leaders of the ASTI would be prepared to damage children's future lives in that way.</P>

      <P>What consideration has the Minister given to the long-term impact of this dispute? The dispute will be resolved eventually, but what consideration has the Minister given to the negative impact the dispute, and particularly his confrontational approach, will have on the morale and general good standing of the education system and on the integrity of the teaching profession?

Teachers were prepared to teach but not to do voluntary work. The Government's decision is absurd and would be dismissed by any court. Will the Minister withdraw the threat to withhold pay? I spoke to a teacher today who said she would never again do an hour of voluntary work. I spent years teaching and doing voluntary work. I would not have accepted the right of anyone to cut my salary because I decided to stop doing voluntary work.</P>

      <P>I was referring to Deputy Barrett's contribution regarding the fact that RTE would have a shareholding in the transmission company. The Deputy felt this was strange but he will know that RTE has had transmission responsibilities since its foundation.</P>
      <P>The other issue referred to was the use of frequencies. The use of the frequencies concerned will be licensed to the operator in the same way as frequencies are licensed to many other users in the broadcasting and other sectors.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 11 refer to universal coverage and the purpose of amendment No. 6 is to try to obtain 100% coverage. We would like to see 100% coverage, however, as has been pointed out at various stages during this Bill, such coverage is not possible because of technical difficulties. The amendments are in response to concerns expressed by Deputies O'Shea and Clune regarding universal coverage and the DTT platform. The amendments encompass the Deputies' concerns.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 13 proposes that the Minister may only revoke such a direction for stated reasons if, and only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;The Commission shall renew the licence of a broadcasting licence holder when it expires for a period of not less than five years if the licence holder has complied with the requirements of the licence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment following representations to a number of Deputies regarding the future of local broadcasting and the future for local broadcasters in terms of the renewal of their licences. The licences of a number of independent local broadcasters are due for renewal within the next 12 months. There is no guarantee that the licences of existing licence holders will be renewed. That is why I tabled this amendment to the effect that when the licences of such licence holders should be renewed they should be renewed for a period of not less than five years provided they have complied with the requirements of licence.</P>
      <P>Many local broadcasters have invested a good deal of money in their stations and developed a strong market around the country, as is evident from their listenership figures. They play an important role in public service broadcasting. They provide a service to which people want to listen and in which they have interest and wish to contribute. Some local radio stations have an extraordinarily high listenership, given that they operate in direct competition with national broadcasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of digital advancement in audio and visual broadcasting, these radio stations will need to make a substantial investment to upgrade their equipment and to prepare for the advancement of audio broadcasting. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the renewal of their licences, it is difficult for many, and impossible for some of them to obtain funding to invest in <Col N="767" /> their stations at this stage. The amendment seeks to ensure that certainty will surround the renewal of such licences and the uncertainty that exists regarding their renewal, which is a cause of worry to many local stations, would be removed.</P>
    <P>I stress that local radio stations are not opposed to competition. They merely seek to have their licences renewed. They welcome competition. They have proved they can survive and do well in the face of strong national competition. I would not like to give the impression that acceptance of this amendment would be at the expense of all other operations. It would not be. This amendment seeks to ensure that the licences of those who have invested and who have a proven track record in local broadcasting would be renewed subject to their complying with the requirements of the existing licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24 are in my name. An amendment similar to amendment No. 24 was tabled on Committee Stage and debated at length. Essentially, the licences of many local radio stations are due for renewal in a year's time. There is a concern among the licence holders that the licences will be advertised again and there will be a competition for them. The Labour Party considers such an approach would be unfair.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues involved. Stations that are uncertain about their future tenure will find it difficult to retain staff. If such staff can move to other employment with more security, it is logical that they would do so. The current position is one of anti-investment in the local radio stations. Who will invest in new equipment to upgrade such stations against the background that the licence of the local radio stations may not be renewed in the next round of applications? With regard to the uncertainty surrounding employment, it is not beneficial for local radio stations that their more talented staff can be attracted out of the local area because the local station cannot guarantee any term of employment beyond the period when the licences come up for renewal.</P>
      <P>The basis of these amendments is not anti-competition. These stations broadcast to a limited audience. The return on investment in these stations is gained over time. From the point of view of investors, upgrading of the service provided and the need to ensure certainty surrounds employment in these stations. I ask the Minister to consider the amendments tabled by the Labour Party, one of which is similar to a Committee Stage amendment and the other two were tabled following representations by representatives of the local radio sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister tabled amendments Nos. 106 and 107. I look forward to her presentation of those and to being convinced that they effectively will address the problems we presented to her on Committee Stage.</P>

As a Member who represents a Dublin constituency, unfortunately I do not have access to the type of local radio service available in Cork, Limerick and other cities enjoyed by my colleagues who represent rural constituencies. Dublin people have access to a few commercial radio stations but not local radio stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time I drive outside Dublin I tune in to the local radio station. Local stations provide a great service for the local community. They have proven they are well able to compete with national broadcasting organisations. They supply a unique service to the people in the communities they serve. If we are talking about building community spirit, they are an integral part of that. Acceptance of the amendment proposed by Deputy Clune would give certainty to those stations that are pursuing a policy, which we hoped would be pursued when the licences were issued in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea's points were valid. These local stations need to retain their staff. Those who work in local radio broadcasting build up a relationship with their listenership. It would be terrible if due to uncertainty about the future tenure of such stations, there was a movement away from local stations. That point made by Deputy O'Shea is valid.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if she could persuade the commission to promote the concept of local radio in the greater Dublin area. If any area needs local radio, the Dublin region does, as it is so sprawling the people who live on one side of the road often do not know the people who live on the other side of the road. With regard to proper planning and development, local radio stations help to build a community spirit and inform people of what is happening in their local areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a local authority in my constituency, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. We have a free sheet but not the local written press to which many rural members are fortunate to have access in their constituencies. We do not have local radio in my constituency. There is an absence of coverage of what is happening in local communities. All one need do is observe the turnout in local elections in the greater urban areas. The turnout is declining because people are not relating to what is happening in their local communities because they do not hear what is happening. Local authorities in Dublin compete for space in national newspapers. The Minister lived in Dublin for a long time and knows what I am talking about. I hope she accepts this amendment as it will bring certainty to those who are fortunate enough to have local radio in their communities. Will the Minister promote and encourage the concept of developing a local radio system in the <Col N="769" /> greater Dublin area as it would be good for proper planning? I do not begrudge local radio to those who have it in their areas, as it is marvellous, but it is certainly absent from my area. The Minister should accept this reasonable amendment, which sets out the requirement that those who are issued licences must comply with the requirements of the previous licence issued.</P>

        <b>:</b> I also support this amendment, as local radio has given the country tremendous service. I know certain regulations and standards are set out for local radio and I do not suggest that a station that issues balderdash every day should have its licence renewed automatically but many of them give an excellent service. It is very helpful to know what is going on at a local level.

        <b>:</b> Death notices on local radio serve a very important purpose. Many people do not buy the newspapers and many deaths are not announced in those newspapers because of the expense. If a business consortium can outbid local people for a station it would probably have no interest in such local matters. It is important to be able to announce there are floods or traffic jams in certain parts of the county, not to mention snails going at a slow pace.</P>

        <b>:</b> No. My problem is I go too fast all the time. I am celebrating an anniversary so I survived it all. It is important that these local crises are announced to the public. I would not expect RTE to be able to announce flooding in Leighlinbridge or Bagenalstown.</P>
      <P>Regarding their coverage of local sport, when the Blues of Carlow beat Nimo Rangers next February in the semi-final of the All-Ireland Club Championship everyone in Carlow will be listening to that great news. I would not expect RTE to cover that even in February but local radio does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One member of the staff of CKR has been employed there for ten years, since the station was founded. Staff have a right to some continuity if they are giving the service, but they also have an advantage because of their experience over time, because of the expense they have gone to for the station to upgrade standards and because of the expertise of the staff: the three Xs. All their work and investment should be rewarded. They should not just be beaten by someone with far more money who can afford to <Col N="770" /> pay a PR company to produce a marvellous glossy application that might sway those in authority.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people want a practical service and the Minister should accept this reasonable amendment. We might fit it into a political Bill also so that Deputies who have given five years' service would be automatically re-elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers' comments about local radio. The Minister does not want to harm local radio and I hope she accepts one of these amendments. Local radio supplies something national media cannot offer regarding local matters. Deputy Browne referred to some features of local radio. I add the community diary, where a group can place an advertisement for nothing. It is not often nowadays that one can run a function and have advertisements, through local radio, that are heard in every house in the area at no cost. That can be of huge benefit to groups such as old age pensioners' groups or community organisations.</P>
      <P>Those involved in local radio want to be part of the community and to work to better that community. That is one of the solid aspects of local radio that we must help. There is also linkage between many local radio stations. Deputy Browne mentioned the match between Nimo Rangers and O'Hanrahans, or the Blues. When a club or county team plays away from home there is often a linkage between CKR, for example, and the local radio station in the area in which the game is taking place, to facilitate a commentary. That provides entertainment for people, particularly old age pensioners and the disabled, who cannot get to these games. They depend on local radio commentary to find out how games are going.</P>
      <P>Local radio stations have made a major effort in that way to become part of the community. I have spoken to the owners of local radio stations and they often say they will not ever get back the money they have invested but they want to be part of the community. If we do not protect that and a national media empire is allowed into this field we will destroy something every political party works with and uses when they want to bring matters to the attention of their constituents. If this goes national we will lose something and we will not get it back. People will be afraid to invest money because there will be no security for their investment. In many cases they invest money for the community, as they have no guarantees they will get the money back and as a result, we benefit both through our parties and as Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to this amendment. We have received representations from our various stations &ndash; Deputy Browne probably had major representations from CKR, which has been one of the major successes of local radio; it has supplied some national figures who have come up through community radio and has one of the highest listenership levels any<Col N="771" /> where in the country. I implore the Minister to incorporate a provision along the lines of this amendment into the Bill in order to give the necessary protection to local radio stations across the country. This will be of benefit to everyone. It will mean that each station will know its little empire is not under threat. The good work they do will enable them to ensure that funding will be available to advance the station in their area. That network of stations has proved to be of major benefit to each community and nationally because of the network they have set up to report certain events. One can hear Cork FM for instance broadcasting up to date information on sport, news or whatever is of interest on a given day.</P>
    <P>It is not the Minister's intention to harm community radio. I implore her to show that, by accepting one of the amendments before her and thereby ensuring that this part of Irish life will be protected for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Clune and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment because there is great concern particularly among people working for local radio stations. Local radio is the greatest thing that happened in this State. For far too long, the national media did not cover local events. When governments had the opportunity, they did not legislate to make the national stations operate community stations. If they had done that, RTE would have total control of the airwaves.</P>
      <P>I come from the west of Ireland, where we have mid west and north west radio. The community loves the service and the figures have proven that the local stations have the most listeners, more than RTE and they have done well nationally. They have the highest listenership countrywide for local radio. The staff are concerned. It is wrong if these stations have been operating within the law and doing the job right, that they should have to re-apply for the licences. The people who should have to re-apply for the licences are the people who broke the law and who have not operated within their licences. That is not the case with 99.9% of the local stations. I do not see why this uncertainty should be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local radio covers sports events, community events and even the death notices, which Deputy O'Malley might think is a joke. The only time the west of Ireland and rural areas ever got a mention in the national papers was in the death notices but the people had to pay for it. I am glad to say that I look forward to seeing the Minister stopping what is happening now, such as what happened in Cork recently, where big money makers, <Col N="772" /> big investors such as Granada and outside influences came in to buy local radio stations. The Minister should tell these people that we will not allow it. For too long, there was a monopoly in RTE, but that is no longer the case. We do not want to see a monopoly such as the one involving the daily newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the associated Independent Newspapers group, which has total control in the State over what happens in the media. We do not want outside influences with big money coming in and taking over the local stations. The people in local radio have done the job well and my radio station has done the job well. Deputy Higgins will tell the Minister that my local radio gives fair coverage to anybody who wants to speak on radio, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. Many people in political parties do not want to speak and then they blame the radio station although they are afraid to go on and express their own point of view. Local radio is open to everybody, to community, to political parties and to sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>It has worked and the Minister should not tamper with anything that has worked. In this State we spend too long tampering with things that work and then they will not work. Local radio has worked and has been the greatest success among many things that have happened in this State. I want to see community television added on to radio service. That should be the next step so that along with hearing us, people will be able to see us. It is difficult enough to get on the national airwaves, to get on RTE. When the story breaks, where do they go first? Straight to Dublin city. The rural man, if he is a spokesman for anything, never gets a chance, it always has to be the city man.</P>
    <P>Thank God for local radio. The Minister should accept this amendment which recognises the wonderful work of the local radios. As Deputy Higgins will tell the Minister, we have great people like Paula Walsh, Liam McNally and Teresa O'Malley who do a great job. They are household names now. They can be heard in the morning and the evening and we listen to death notices twice a day and we try not to miss any funerals. We know what is going on &ndash; thank God for local radio. We want it left there forever. The people who have the licences have done a good job. They do not mind competition and they have competition such as RTE, BBC and Sky. However, this is not about competition, it is about giving people security in that profession and the opportunity to know that their jobs will be there next year or the year after.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be honourable and do the right thing and accept the amendment. I think she will because she is that kind of a Minister.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support the views of my colleague, Deputy Ring. It is very difficult to compete with that kind of oratory, or that kind of conviction or passion. However, we are singing from the same hymn sheet. I am at a loss to know <Col N="773" /> why these stations which have proven their credentials, which have been subjected to the most rigorous of standards, which are constantly being surveyed by the Independent Radio and Television Commission, and have met the most rigorous of standards, cannot be taken at face value and be deemed automatically to have the right to licence renewal. The Minister in her amendment No. 106 is to some extent attempting to address the concerns of the radio stations. However, it would be too bad if their track record was not taken into consideration. Their bona fides are proven on the basis of their track record. I cannot understand why they cannot be guaranteed continuity of their licence for the next few years, by virtue of the fact that they have come from very small beginnings &ndash; many of them have come out of the twilight zone of the pirate stations &ndash; they have proven their credentials and have built a very strong and credible track record. That is all that is being sought.</P>
      <P>On having proven their worth and their credentials, local radios have been universally successful in tapping in to the feelings and spirit of the local community and in enhancing the local community, as Deputy Ring and the other speakers said. All one has to do is look at the range of programmes they provide. Not alone do they provide top quality local news, they also provide huge community service by way of providing amplification for local community functions and various fetes and occasions.</P>
      <P>Not alone that, they have given communities confidence in their identity, their individuality and their own worth. They have done a huge amount in terms of building morale within communities. These communities would be largely ignored if they were depending on the national television or radio service. In fairness it would be impossible for a national station to give the kind of blanket universal coverage required. The local stations have provided a huge service for the local communities. In addition, they have also provided a sounding board and a platform. They are the very essence of democracy in allowing people freedom of speech in relation to what local people think about a range or issues, political and otherwise.</P>

    <P>It would be ironic and wrong if the blanket of protection was removed from them at this stage because they are still at an embryonic stage of development. Many of them have invested heavily in studios, building, equipment and staff. Very often they have developed a top class broadcaster only to see that individual poached by somebody else. However, there is very little they can do about it. In that regard they provide an invaluable service in terms of grooming talent at local level, such as young journalists, bringing them from the fledgling stage to a considerable stage of maturity only then to have them snatched from under their noses. They provide an invaluable service in terms of grooming a considerable amount of local talent from the point of view of culture, music and the range of local activities that are nurtured <Col N="774" /> by local radio. They have invested heavily and, without grant-aid, have developed into top class local facilities.</P>
    <P>Many are at a stage when they thought they could commence stage two of their development. My local radio station in Mayo, which is also that of Deputy Ring and others, provides a service to Roscommon and north and east Galway. It has elaborate investment and development plans for phase two. What bank manager in his sane senses would give a loan to a company when there is a question mark hanging over its future? Despite the Minister's assurance that, from the point of view of being granted a licence, their track record will speak for itself, there is no guarantee of that. I do not understand why an exception cannot be made for these cases.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and commend Deputy Clune for tabling it. We are not doing this out of pragmatism or for our political welfare but out of a belief that these people have proved their worth, have a proven track record, passed the most rigorous scrutiny tests, reached the highest possible standards and there is no reason they should not be allowed to continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Local radio has transformed rural Ireland. In the past, radio revolved around what happened in Dublin. Local radio stations have changed the listening habits of the community and the involvement of people in their local communities. They provide comprehensive coverage of local events, issues and so on. In my area, Radio 3 is on one side of the county and Shannonside is on the other. They cover various events on a regular basis, be it the county championship final or whatever and bring the county score and the results to the local community at an early stage, very often with a light commentary. They give people an opportunity to discuss local issues on radio and provide a comprehensive service.</P>
      <P>They have a range of programmes providing a very good mix. In the old days of pirate radio stations, there was wall to wall music day after day. Local radio stations provide news programmes, talk shows, music and cultural programmes. They cover a range of events. The local news is the one most listened to. If politicians speak on the local radio, people hear them. Local stations have a great listenership. People respond to what they hear on these stations and we must ensure that is nurtured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards staff turnover at local radio stations, unfortunately they operate on a shoestring. It is difficult for them to secure money for investment because of the uncertainty hanging over them. If a broadcaster is not well paid he or she will move to another job. They may have gained very valuable experience on the local radio. That is a pity from a local point of view because good broadcasters and journalists are invaluable. They record what is happening and keep everyone informed and on their toes. Good journalists are being lost because they do not have continuity of <Col N="775" /> employment and the rate of pay is not high. One of RTE's presenters in the midlands area, Ciaran Mulooly, started his apprenticeship with a local radio and worked with it for quite some time before moving, very successfully, to RTE. That is an indication that local radio fulfils a worthwhile role in training people in the broadcasting media.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and hope the Minister, being a pragmatic person, will see the merit in it and accept it.</P>

      <P>The fine values of local radio stations have been outlined already. I commend Deputy Clune for tabling this amendment and I am confident the Minister will see it as reasonable. The Independent Radio and Television Commission is the supervisory and regulatory body for local stations. They must have a balance between news and music and if they transgress as regards output, they are monitored and tracked on an ongoing basis. Surely it makes sense if they have an established track record to allocate licences for five years or longer.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, in County Limerick there are five radio stations, Clare FM, Kerry Radio, Limerick Radio, County Sound and Tipperary FM. The strength of local radio is dominant in rural Ireland and provides an important lifeline for elderly people who listen, on an ongoing basis, to the radio station. Many people do not buy newspapers. They do not monitor what is happening but they hear the issues on local radio, be it a council estimates meeting or whatever. There is a chat show on most radio stations in the mornings. One is allowed a good deal of time to put forward one's case. We are in the Dáil until late at night speaking on various issues. In many cases, no-one picks up the message we send out. Local radio is the only medium available to politicians who wish to communicate with the people who elected them, particularly if the issue is pertinent to them. It provides an opportunity for those who elected us to the Dáil and to local authorities to hear us in action trying to deliver the goods for our constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no uncertainty if radio stations are operating properly. This amendment is important because it would provide continuity in cases where stations have an established track record. Those who commence their careers in local radio and then move on to national newspapers or the national broadcasting station, bring an important quality with them in that they can empathise with rural people. Iarla Mongey has been appointed assistant Government press officer. I am sure the Minister is aware he was employed in a local radio station. I heard an interview with him last week. He was being congratulated on his appointment and he stated the length of time he had been with the radio station. He praised politicians because he had an idea of what we were doing in Leinster House and he spoke about the hours and maximum effort we put into the job. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="776" /> knows that a segment of the electorate has no appreciation of the hours we devote to our work. Quite often the media focuses very unfairly on the negative aspects. If one wants to highlight an example of that, one has only to read the recent Buckley report which covers a layer of&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Clune's amendment on this issue. I am sure the Minister recognises the importance of local radio. The growth of local radio in the past ten years has been tremendous. Most local radio stations have found an important niche in their own communities. That has to be acknowledged. Anything we do to damage, eliminate or curtail local radio would be a retrograde step. For that reason, I hope the Minister will take on board the opinion on this side of the House in regard to the development of local radio and the continuation of confidence in it.</P>
      <P>Members have said that support for these amendments should not be seen as avoidance of competition. The 21 local radio stations have proved themselves over the past ten years or so. They are viable operations which are very important in their local communities. The Minister would be the first to appreciate that there is a bias in favour of national radio and this amendment must be viewed in that context. If we, through our acceptance of this amendment, level the playing pitch &ndash; nobody is asking for anything more &ndash; we would do a good day's work on this aspect of the Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that each of us recognise the importance of our local radio station, and I am thinking of Galway Bay FM. It has shown itself to be a tremendous quality radio station. It covers the broad spectrum of society and its programming represents that spectrum. Galway Bay FM has shown confidence by constructing a new headquarters which is ample example of its directors commitment to local radio. We have to <Col N="777" /> acknowledge that. Galway Bay FM, with its high grade and up to date equipment, is probably one of the best radio stations in the country. It is important that we, through the acceptance of this amendment, give local radio stations confidence that nothing we do further down the line will damage them.</P>
    <P>If we give local radio stations that confidence, they will be encouraged to develop further. I am thinking in particular of extending into the area of education &ndash; I am sure this forms part of the plans of many local radio stations. It is probably the one area which has been lacking, but lacking in so far as local radio stations did not have the funds and most of their investments were confined to the presentation of programmes, current affairs, music, agriculture and the arts, all of which are adequately covered. My local radio station, Galway Bay FM, has probably the finest range of programmes of any local radio station. Local radio has a vital role to play in education, an area into which it must expand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take on board this amendment in so far as it will give the necessary confidence to local radio to continue. I <Col N="778" /> would like to see all local radio stations, particularly in my area, continuing to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best not to be repetitive but I agree with the previous speakers in regard to the contribution local radio has made to communities. It has done more to recognise cultural diversity than any other medium. It has taken into account local dialects. Those who would not go on national radio go on local radio with a lot more confidence because they are speaking to an audience which can understand their dialect. That is an aspect of local radio that may not be fully understood.</P>
      <P>I agree with all the other reasons put forward in regard to community development. We all referred to our own local radio stations and Radio Kerry has been one of the most successful in the country and has created concepts like the &ldquo;Rambling House&rdquo; and many more that are now being used by other local radio stations.</P>
      <P>It will probably be a number of years before another broadcasting Bill is brought before this House. I am sure the Minister hopes there will not be another one &ndash; certainly not in her time, however long that will last.</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity. Deputy Clune is seeking a five year period and that is what the representative body of local radio is also seeking. I appeal to the Minister, as a Deputy representing a rural constituency, to accede to this request. The people in Radio Kerry want to make a major investment in the radio station. As the Minister knows, the transition from analogue to digital will be very expensive and they will not have the capacity to borrow if this is not accepted. If the licence has to be renewed and if there are other competitors, those with capacity to make a huge investment will have the advantage.</P>
      <P>I do not know precisely what the new licensing conditions would be but it seems that would be the way to introduce competition. That is fair enough but people have to be given a period in which to consolidate their position, to develop their programmes and so on. Will the Minister accede to this reasonable request. It would be different if it was open-ended but it is not; it is five years which is a reasonable amount of time. It is probable that after five years, broadcasting in Ireland will be looked at again. If it is not working and if certain radio stations are not fulfilling their obligation the licence should be up for renewal and available to a competitor. The point has been well made. The Minister is able to stand on her own two feet, she is an independent lady and makes her own decisions. I ask her to accept our wisdom. This side is not misleading the Minister. This is an issue on which she would gain many kudos throughout the length and breadth of Ireland if she were to accede to this request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Clune. It is a reasonable amendment and I know the Minister to be a reasonable person. I shall be parochial and speak about the <Col N="779" /> service in my area, Northern Sound, of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be aware and from which he has derived many benefits. It has a proven track record. This station which is extremely popular has an excellent staff. It provides a service that is particular to the catchment area of Cavan-Monaghan, Longford, Westmeath. The announcements and the advertisements give a lift to the people in the area. It provides local news items as well as the national and international news. Local news, local sporting events and obituaries are all covered by local radio. This is a tremendous service that cannot be ignored. Deputy Clune's amendment is not only timely but appropriate. I have had representations from the staff who are concerned about the continuity of their jobs. Good quality people with a certain appeal or a certain quality in a local station will be grabbed by the bigger stations. We do not want to lose those good people because of uncertainty. For that reason I ask the Minister to take on board this amendment. As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, it is not open-ended, it is for a period of not less than five years where there is a proven track record. That is reasonable. In the case I am supporting, there is a proven track record. It is generally accepted nationally that the local stations are providing a good service and a professionalism that we have come to expect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments in the names of Deputies Clune and O'Shea are either the same or have largely the same objective as similar amendments that were proposed on Committee Stage. As I said on Committee Stage, while I admire the commitment and the talent of our independent broadcasters I cannot agree to an amendment that appears to grant individual broadcasters life-long licences. I realise that amendment No. 22 in the name of Deputy O'Shea would confine life-long contracts to radio station operators rather than to television station operators. My objection to it remains the same. Accordingly, I must oppose amendments Nos. 14, 22, 23 and 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it is only fair that the Independent Radio and Television Commission or, as it will be known, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland should have regard to the performance of the holder of a sound broadcasting contract in complying with the terms of the contract taken into account if that contractor applies for a new contract. I accept also that a person who is not successful in an application for a broadcasting contract is entitled to be given the reasons an application has failed. I understand the Independent Radio and Television Commission will do this but I can see some merit in having these principles enshrined in law. This is why I move amendment No. 106. This amendment largely meets the objectives of amendment No. 23 in the name of Deputy O'Shea and amendment No. 107 in the name of Deputy Clune. The requirement of the Independent Radio and Television Com<Col N="780" /> mission to have regard to past performance of an existing sound broadcasting contractor meets some of the objectives of amendment No. 22 and should provide reassurance for the existing operators that their tract record will be considered.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to this debate. It is heartening to find that Members are almost vying with each other to extol the virtues of their local radio stations. I may as well join in and mention on behalf of Deputy Donal Carey and myself that we certainly appreciate the work done by Clare FM. I am sure he would join in saying there is no political bias in that radio station&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to say &ndash; and I ask for a little latitude &ndash; is that we are expounding the virtues of Clare FM. I join every single Member in underlying the tremendous value that local radio has been to the local communities. Deputy Barrett suggested that local radio formed community spirit. Whatever about forming the community spirit, local radios certainly mirror that community spirit. The strength of local radio is that it is local and is not interested in the stories covered elsewhere on a national basis. Local radio is interested in the stories that the people in the local communities want to hear and that is the reason they have been such a success.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be a member of the party which introduced legislation to set up local radio. It was not the universally held view during those debates that local radio would be a success. Not everyone shared the view that it was a welcome proposal. Having seen how local radio works everyone is now ready to support that concept.</P>
      <P>Having listened carefully, particularly, to Deputies Barrett and Browne, I believe they were supporting my amendment, although they may not have meant to do that. Deputy Barrett said he was rather envious of those who lived in local areas outside of Dublin because they had an excellent radio station to listen to. I do not think he felt the same about what is available on the airwaves in the Dublin area. He was putting forward a convincing argument against automatic renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with the views expressed by Deputy Browne who said he did not believe in an automatic renewal for all because, obviously, there were some who gave an even better service than others and there was an element of competition. I have expressed the view both on Committee Stage and on Report Stage that a guarantee cannot be given to existing licence holders. There can be no question of an automatic licence or a roll-over licence. I wanted to ensure that cognisance would be taken by the Independent Radio and Television Commission of the work done and the contracts complied with under the licensing system. That has been provided for in my amendment. The other element of my amend<Col N="781" /> ment provides that reasons be given for failure of an application. The Independent Radio and Television Commission should comply with that requirement. Perhaps it was going to do it. It is important that that principle be enshrined in law. This is something that IBI sought.</P>
    <P>To recap, while I cannot accept amendments Nos. 14, 22, 23, 24 and 107, I will move amendment No. 106 in due course. However, I feel the views expressed by Members are incorporated in great part in the amendment I have tabled. I have decided, in recognition of the contribution made by existing local radio operators, to ensure that where such an operator applies for a sound broadcasting contract, the Independent Radio and Television Commission will be required to take into account the operator's past performance in adhering to his or her existing licences. In addition, I am ensuring that the Independent Radio and Television Commission will give unsuccessful applicants a reason for that decision.</P>
    <P>That is my position on this issue. I made my views known on Committee Stage. I then thought very deeply about the issue and listened to the arguments put forward in the House and elsewhere. I feel that while we cannot give a guarantee or an automatic licence, the approach in my amendment satisfies the general thrust of the principle we have been discussing this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not disagree with any of the contributions of my colleagues, they have not recognised the time limit factor in this debate. If the debate concludes at 6 p.m., several areas of the Bill will not be addressed. These are important areas because they have a high employment content and affect many young people with prospects who were looking forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 106 but it does not meet the aspirations of the people who made the representations. Licence holders have a problem in regard to catchment areas. Some catchment areas have limited population access. Local radio has proved in some areas to be far from the licence to print money that it was supposed to be. The amount of capital investment for renewal impinges greatly on the finances of local stations, which is why they want this continuity. That is not addressed in the amendment. Their track record in this area has been ignored.</P>
      <P>There have been great successes, such as in Kerry and CKR, which has a widespread catchment area and can be received in Waterford and Dublin. However, Clare FM, which the Minister praised, has a very limited catchment area. How can the directors of that company be expected to continue their capital investment if they cannot be assured of the continuity of the licence? There is substantial investment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That issue has not been addressed, although the Minister went some way towards it by recommending guidelines for the Independent Radio and Television Commission in regard to what it should take into consideration when it is examin<Col N="782" /> ing the suitability of an applicant. However, a person can come in over its head and bid on it. I do not think the Minister has gone far enough. However, I do not want to delay the debate as I have made my point about all the other amendments that have yet to be debated. Nothing is going to happen about it as it is now 5.45 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Minister found the Committee Stage debate, during which many points were made to her, very useful. She complied with much of the sentiment expressed and accepted amendments. She made a reasonable announcement today about the funding for TG4, in regard to which strong appeals were made to her on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I accept one cannot do everything. However, the way the Bill had to be introduced was wrong. It has been rejigged a number of times. Matters will now go undebated and we still will not have got the legislation right. We will not get to deal with some of the EU or constitutional difficulties in the Bill. This was our final chance to do that but it will not happen.</P>

      <P>As the debate is drawing to an end, I want to put on record the fact that we in the Labour Party appreciate that the Minister listened to the Committee Stage debate and, in some instances, met or went a good way towards meeting our concerns.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, in amendment No. 106, gone part of the way towards meeting some of our concerns in regard to the renewal of licences, particularly in the second part of the amendment, whereby reasons will have to be given for decisions on applications.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty, however, with the first part of the amendment, where it states &ldquo;the Commission shall have regard to the extent to which the applicant complied with any sound broadcasting contract or contracts&rdquo;. My reading of that, as a layman, is that the words &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; do not go very far. It means, effectively, that it will be taken into consideration but there is no measure of the extent of that. However, I grant that it is progressive.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be able to give further enlightenment as to whether this formula reaches any further than I have outlined. It seems aspirational to say the commission &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; it but does not have any mandatory effect in relation to the performance of the particular applicant in regard to a contract or contracts which that person may have previously held. While I recognise progress has been made, I am not convinced by what the Minister is proposing in the first part of her amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge the Minister has in her amendment No. 106 met some of the concerns of the independent broadcasters, there is no guarantee that their licences will be renewed. These licences will be advertised and, as Deputy Carey said, any person will be able to bid for them. That is creating a level of uncer<Col N="783" /> tainty and is not good for the future of local radio. I thank all my colleagues who supported this amendment. They have given us a very strong flavour of the value of local radio.</P>
      <P>The aim of my amendment is not to develop a situation whereby life long licences would be available. The amendment proposes that the licence should be renewed &ldquo;for a period of not less than five years if the licence holder has complied with the requirements of the licence&rdquo;. This situation has been likened to that of pub licences, which are renewed provided the track record of the licence holder is good. That is what we want to have here. If a local radio licence holder has a good track record and has complied with the requirements of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the licence should be renewed. The current uncertainty precludes them from investing and upgrading equipment. There is also the question of local employment and the valuable community service local radio provides.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister cannot accept the amendment and cannot see that the provision it contains would be very valuable for local radio. It is not anti-competitive, for example there is competition from the national broadcaster.</P>

      <P>Where the Commission decides to refuse to award a sound broadcasting contract to an applicant &ndash; the Commission shall notify the applicant of the reasons for the decision.</P>
      <P>Can the reasons given be rectified? In what position does this put the applicant? Will applicants have to wait for a further period for licences to be issued again before they can re-apply? This is the concern of my local station and I am sure it concerns other Deputies. Will the Minister clarify the position so we can tell our local stations that she has gone as far as she can, advise them why a refusal can arise and what can happen thereafter, including whether the application can be rectified or if the applicant must wait for a further period of time to elapse before making a new application?</P>

At that stage the decision would already have been taken by the Independent Radio and Television Commission and on foot of that the applicant would be contacted and given the reasons the application was unsuccessful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clune said there was no guarantee for these licences. I have pointed out why we cannot have a guarantee concerning a roll-over licence. No guarantee can be given that existing licences <Col N="784" /> would be renewed. My amendment goes some way to ensuring that the Independent Radio and Television Commission would take into account, and have due regard for, the past performance of existing sound broadcasting contractors and to addressing the concerns raised by Members. We have debated this issue at length and I do not propose to repeat what I have said other than to say my amendment is the way forward.</P>

      <P>At this stage we should be debating local radio and local and community television. There is a weakness in the Bill in so far as TV3 appears to be the only designated broadcaster to look after community television, certainly on the MMDS system. We are seeking continuity on the radio side, while on the community television side we want to ensure local communities are able to establish a local station without having recourse to existing companies.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not recognise the limitations of local radios in their catchment areas. While she has given them some reassurance, she has not gone as far as we would like. No guarantee is provided, and that is the bottom line.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) No person shall sit on the Commission as a Commissioner unless their proposed appointment has been approved by the relevant Oireachtas Committee acting in public session.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage and I strongly support the principle here. I accept the Minister has the right to appoint a commissioner, but the appointment should be put before an Oireachtas committee to enable the members to question the appointment. I do not envisage an invasion of the privacy of the person to be appointed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 in my name deals with the broadcasting commission. At present RTE has an authority, TV3 is answerable to the Independent Radio and Television Commission and when TG4 is established it will also have an authority. My amendment proposes the establishment of an overall authority with responsibility for all broadcasters in the State. Interestingly, the White Paper on broadcasting published in the UK this week contains a similar proposal.</P>
      <P>The present situation could give rise to anomalies. For example, the Independent Radio and Television Commission has told TV3 it cannot broadcast on a certain issue, yet RTE can decide to broadcast on it. That is not right. It would be much better to have a body with an overviewing role where the same rules would be applied to all broadcasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment was discussed on Committee <Col N="785" /> Stage, but the Minister was unsupportive. However, I am encouraged that a similar proposal has been published this week in the UK White Paper on broadcasting. It makes sense to provide for a level playing pitch, with all concerned adhering to the same rules and guidelines.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to give the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language the power to decide on who should be appointed to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Currently, the Government appoints the chairperson and members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. It is required to ensure a person has experience of, or shown capacity in, a number of areas, such as media and commercial affairs, radio communications, engineering, trade union affairs or social, community, educational or cultural affairs.</P>
      <P>These provisions are sufficient. In addition, and as Deputy O'Shea rightly pointed out on Committee Stage, the proposed amendment could serve to put people off serving on the commission. Accordingly, I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before line 1, to insert the following: </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister may, after consultation with the National Salmon Commission, make regulations to provide for a scheme for the tagging of farmed salmon within 2 years if a distortion arises as a result of farmed salmon not <Col N="786" /> being tagged. Such scheme would be administered in a similar manner to the scheme which is in place for the tagging of wild salmon.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a good discussion on this Bill on Second and Committee Stages. I accept a number of the Minister's assertions during those discussions. I am now more happy with this Bill than when I read it initially. The Minister clarified a number of matters for me and for Deputy Bell.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to tag the carcasses of salmon. This issue has been talked about for many years. I recall it being discussed ten years ago. We have now come to the stage where it is about to happen. It was not intended to discuss this issue in both Houses of the Oireachtas, but the measure will be stronger as a result. It would be better if the many regulations passed in the House were passed following a debate. A number of issues were raised by both sides of the House as a result of this debate and that will strengthen the Bill. The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, knows we are here because the Attorney General said it was not possible to introduce on-the-spot fines without legislation being passed in both Houses.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's belief that the tagging of wild salmon will increase the price. It is a type of quality assurance. The public, people in the restaurant and hotel business and tourists will know the product they are getting is wild salmon and not anything else. We had a long discussion about what would happen with farmed salmon. It is possible there could be a breakout at salmon farms and the wrong salmon could be tagged. I tabled one amendment because I wanted to raise public awareness of this issue.</P>
    <P>I want a two-year trial period so that if there are problems with farmed salmon, something could be done to address them. I appreciate that could be difficult, given the huge volume of farmed salmon. However, anglers and others involved in catching wild salmon must ensure the product they are allowed to tag is wild salmon. The Minister agreed to look at this issue and that is included in the report of the committee. I do not know what the committee had in mind.</P>
    <P>I went to great lengths to get an assurance from the Minister, which he readily gave and I am sure the Minister of State will give it tonight as well, that anglers would not be asked to pay for the tag or the log book in the future under any set of circumstances. The Minister of State knows exactly the comparison I will make. Many years ago both of us were told that farmers would not have to pay for cattle tags, although most of them must now be paid for. When that happens once, it could happen a second time. If someone was daft enough to introduce it, the fishing fraternity would show its true colours because it would undermine a potentially good scheme. No one knows how successful this scheme will be.</P>
    <P>One would know Deputy Bell had experience in this area because he said that much of the sal<Col N="787" /> mon caught are not identified. They are sold and taken away in the back of a car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The person was more than sensible about it. We have seen some of that as well, although perhaps not to any great extent. It is difficult to know how to get people in those circumstances to tag the carcass. This is related to protection.</P>
      <P>As regards tagging, it is extremely important to state that anyone who decides to damage or circumvent this scheme is less than patriotic. It will be a hard sell. When most of us were young boys, there was no problem poaching salmon out of a river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not happen in Wexford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The boys in Wexford were the leaders at that pastime.</P>
      <P>It is important to ensure our stocks of salmon are preserved and increased. A person cannot catch salmon if there is none in the river. There would be no reason for this Bill if we had large stocks of salmon in our rivers. I know there are many reason for the lack of salmon, but the fact that we are taking a decision to allow salmon tagging does not mean the rivers will be full of them in two years time; it does not work that way. However, tagging will, at least, give us some indication of the locations at which salmon are caught.</P>
      <P>As stated on Committee Stage, the Bill is not concerned with the micro-tagging of smolts. Live salmon are tagged only when they are caught. Tagging will place a premium on wild salmon and should lead to stocks being increased in all rivers, including those in which salmon have not been seen for many years.</P>
      <P>We must also take action in respect of many other matters which we do not have time to discuss today. If we do not do something about pollution there will be no salmon to tag because, as the Minister of State knows, they cannot live in polluted rivers.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the fact that salmon are being intercepted on their way to Greenland. I am no expert on this matter but I am informed that this leads to huge difficulties in terms of what is called the &ldquo;salmon in-flow&rdquo;. I do not know how one might deal with this problem but it must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been much discussion about drift net fishing and draft net fishing. As Deputy Bell stated on Committee Stage, the use of drift nets in the west has led to a decrease in salmon numbers in rivers in other areas of the country. Many people made their living from drift net fishing in the past and what is now required is the <Col N="788" /> introduction of controls, rather than a total ban, on those who use this method.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a fair point when we discussed the possibility of introducing a set-aside mechanism for the fishing industry. If, from the point of view of conservation, the introduction of set-aside meant that fewer people would be fishing at particular times of the year and that fewer fish would be caught, which would give salmon an opportunity to grow and multiply, I would fully support it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is attending an EU meeting today to discuss cod and hake quotas for next year. I understand that swingeing reductions in quotas are being proposed. We can only hope that the Minister does not let down the side and that the proposed quota reductions will have the same effect on cod and hake stocks as this measure before us will have on salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>In a few minutes, when the Bill is hopefully passed, the Department will be able to set about the introduction of tagging, on-the-spot fines, etc. However, if we do not put in place a proper protection system it will not be possible to implement the provisions of the Bill. The protection staff employed by the fisheries boards do a good job in so far as is possible. However, they are overwhelmed because there are too few of them to cover every mile of river throughout the country.</P>
    <P>People with whom I have discussed this matter have informed me that there are almost no controls in many areas because the fisheries boards have been starved of financial resources for many years by successive Governments. We are determined to invest taxpayers' money in this national resource. If we want members of bona fide angling clubs, ordinary anglers and tourists, to enjoy a day's fishing, we must ensure there are adequate stocks of salmon in our rivers. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources informed me yesterday that he is making a further tranche of £2 million available to the fisheries boards for this and other purposes. Will the Minister of State verify this will happen in 2001?</P>
    <P>If we do not ensure salmon stocks are restored, all our work will be set at naught. I wish to ensure that my position on this matter is not misrepresented. I am not calling for the establishment of a police state and I do not want a water bailiff stationed on every bridge throughout the country. Such action is neither possible nor required. However, the introduction of on-the-spot fines would mean that we must have on-the-spot protection officers. At present, we do not have such officers.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed when I read in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill would not add any cost to the Exchequer. I brought this matter to the notice of the Minister on Committee Stage but he informed me that I had inferred the wrong meaning. One of the reasons I do not intend to call a vote on this amendment is that the Minister convinced me the allocation of a further £2 million will put fisheries boards in a much better posi<Col N="789" /> tion, particularly at certain times of the year. As the Minister of State is aware, controls are more necessary at certain times of the year. The Minister indicated that this £2 million, in addition to funding he made available last year, should make a dramatic difference. If I thought that was not the case, even though I would not like to do so on what is, essentially, a non-political matter, I would call for a division of the House. However, the Minister put forward a strong case and I assume the Minister of State will clarify the position when he replies. If that clarification is forthcoming, I will not call a vote.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the first step on a very long road. I hope, from the point of view of fishermen &ndash; recreational and commercial &ndash; and tourists, that we have commenced a process that will restore salmon stocks to their former glory and ensure they are returned to small rivers and streams in which they have not been seen for many years. Unless we are able to take corrective action in that regard, the Bill will not have worked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We obtained sufficient assurances from the Minister on Committee Stage and it should not be necessary to repeat what was said at that point. The amendments that have been tabled were dealt with adequately on Committee Stage. We will not have a return to the normal level of conservation until draft net fishing is eliminated, as it has been in most countries. Partial set-aside of draft net fishing would not be possible. If some licences in an area are bought out, the remaining boats will simply continue to catch the same amount of salmon as before.</P>
      <P>Salmon traps should be put under the control of the fisheries boards and used for monitoring purposes. These traps were installed by planter landlords and they have continued to be used on many of our rivers. It is time they were taken into the control of the State and used by and on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister gave us an assurance that the £2 million extra funding for next year will be processed, as far as possible, through angling clubs. The money will be allocated to the fisheries boards but will find its way down to the clubs and will be used by them in the interest of the angling fraternity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I chaired the committee on the task force report and the Bill contains many of the committee's recommendations. As Labour Party spokesperson on the marine, I am happy to welcome the Bill. I hope it will contribute to the restoration of wild salmon to their former glory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have taken part in the debate. I am grateful that the amendments are not being pressed and that Opposition Deputies are satisfied with the information and assurances they were given last evening. I repeat those assurances. Deputy Connaughton sought an assurance regarding extra finance for protection. The fisheries boards' annual budget is £13 million. The boards employ <Col N="790" /> a staff of 400 and several other aspects of the scheme must be accounted for. Extra funding of £2 million will be provided for the fisheries board as well as extra funding for the tagging scheme. The tagging scheme will make it easier for fisheries boards to continue their protection programmes and the savings in this area will, in turn, create extra funding.</P>
      <P>Tagging was introduced because of the importance of the wild salmon industry to the country. Wild salmon are an important benefit both to commercial fishermen and the tourism industry. We are told a single salmon caught by a tourist angler is worth £700 to the economy. Some say if Jack Charlton caught a salmon it would not be worth £700 because of his reluctance to spend money in public houses or elsewhere. Nevertheless, tourist anglers are, in general, wealthy people and it is difficult to calculate how much they spend while holidaying in Ireland. It is vital that we protect the wild salmon industry as well as we can. We are probably not doing enough in that regard. The proposed tagging system will benefit. An untagged fish will now be an illegal fish.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned the impracticality of tagging farmed salmon. Salmon farming is a wonderful and growing industry, run by a group of very professional people. I have worked closely with producers of farmed salmon. As Minister of State with responsibility for this area I am proud of this industry. Approximately 200,000 wild salmon are caught each year and it would be difficult to tag that many fish. There are probably 8 million salmon in cages. To tag all of them would be impractical and would impose a huge financial burden on an industry. I am pleased Deputy Connaughton accepts the difficulties such a scheme would present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned escapes. It is in the commercial interest of salmon farmers to have as few escapes as possible and they are becoming less frequent every year.</P>
      <P>Two pilot set-aside schemes are being co-financed by the Department, one on the River Laune in County Kerry and the other on the Munster Blackwater. The schemes are based on licence holders agreeing not to catch fish. They are paid compensation based on the value of the fish. The regional fisheries boards have been asked to develop schemes in consultation with the local fisheries interests based on local stakeholders' contributions to improving the escapement of salmon into the rivers to spawn. Set-aside is a measure to which we should pay more attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned the catching of salmon off the coast as they swim to and from Greenland. This matter is much spoken about in my home area of Wexford. People who fish in the three sister rivers of the Barrow, the Nore and the Suir as well as the Slaney say fishermen from Galway catch all their fish. Deputy Connaughton has raised an interesting issue which should be debated at greater length. Are fish being caught, <Col N="791" /> either illegally by licence holders or as a by-catch? While hard information is difficult to come by, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation is concerned that there may be a problem of by-catch of post-smolt salmon at sea, by trawlers hunting pelagic fish such as herring and mackerel. These fears are based on the fact that these fishing operations coincide in time and place with the migration of salmon. It seems likely that the mackerel fishery has the greatest potential for by-catch of post-smolts. The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation is keeping the matter under review and fishermen lucky enough to catch a few salmon in their nets will be happy about that.</P>
    <P>The wild salmon industry has tourism and commercial benefits for this country. We cannot stress this point enough because, without doubt, the tourism generated has significant spin-off effects. Drift net, draft net and snap net fishermen are prevalent in my area and the use of snap nets is probably confined to the south east. Many families depend on their nets and licences to pay education fees, build extensions and supplement their incomes, albeit modestly. This traditional income is very important.</P>
    <P>Whether there will be a buy-out scheme is an issue for another day but, as someone who lives among draft net, drift net and snap net fishermen, there are benefits for them. However, there is a substantial difference in the money made on a salmon caught in the drift net and one caught by a tourist, but it will take much encouragement to get draft net, drift net and snap net fishermen to accept that fact. This is because the issue involves an income supplement and traditions which, by and large, have been handed down from generation to generation.</P>
    <P>I thank Opposition Deputies for accepting the Bill in the spirit intended and commend them for their knowledge of the subject. The purpose of the Bill is to copperfasten the implementation of the wild salmon tagging scheme which will commence on 1 January 2001, and the sooner the better. The Minister signed the tagging scheme regulations in August following consultation with the widely-representative National Salmon Commission, which I commend for its input. The commission takes a commonsense approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>The tagging scheme is an important management tool. The catch data generated by the scheme of tags and log books will critically inform the development of salmon management policies. Yesterday the Minister said there would be no charge for tags or log books and I reassure the House of that fact.</P>
    <P>The national wild salmon resource is also very important as is the sustainable development of the species for the enjoyment of future generations, be they Irish or tourists from abroad. It is important to determine salmon management policy on the basis of respect for the legitimate com<Col N="792" /> mercial and recreational stakeholders in the resource. I thank the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill which will amend and extend the Health Insurance Act, 1994. Private health insurance plays an important role in the provision of hospital services to a large proportion of the population. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, intends that this Bill will provide a framework which further supports the development of a vigorous and competitive private health insurance market.</P>
      <P>The Bill implements improvements and innovations in the general regulatory framework outlined in the White Paper on private health insurance published by the Government in September 1999. The Bill also aims to provide an enhanced scope for competition in the market, while strengthening the basis on which solidarity between generations operates through community rating.</P>
      <P>The essence of and challenge to legislation in this area is to strike a successful balance between good common values which have served our significant insured population well, and the encouragement of competition which will benefit consumers in terms of choice, price and service. The achievement of this balance is at the heart of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The voluntary private health insurance system has developed to its current high penetration levels on the basis of specific and widely-accepted core principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover which provide extensive safeguards. The health insurance market was opened to competition under the Health Insurance Act, 1994, enacted in the interests of the common good. The Act provides significant safeguards for insured persons in the context of opening the health insurance market to competition in accordance with EU obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 Act requires health insurance undertakings to operate in accordance with community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. It also provides for minimum benefits whereby undertakings cannot provide less than a specified level of cover. In addition, it provides for risk equalis<Col N="793" /> ation, the sharing of community risks and the registration of undertakings.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory body known as the Health Insurance Authority. During the passage of the 1994 Act, it was indicated that, because regulation in this area represented a completely new departure, the framework would be reviewed in five years. The programme for Government laid the ground for the preparation of the first policy statement on private health insurance delivered in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The White Paper outlines how the health insurance system complements arrangements for the provision of health services to the public. In that context, it refers to the advantages resulting from the mix of public-private practices in hospitals. Notwithstanding this, and as stated in the White Paper, the primary concern is to ensure equal access to public health services. Since taking office the Government has pursued this responsibility through an extensive programme of current and capital expenditure. The Estimates highlighted the Government's commitment to ensure we have a proper public health service.</P>
    <P>For many years people were concerned we were drifting towards a two-tier health system. We have a long way to go to ensure those in the public health system receive equitable treatment to those on private insurance. There are long waiting lists for those in the public health system but this is not the case for those with private insurance. We are trying to address this issue and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government acknowledges the difficulties in health and is allocating huge resources to this area. It is timely that we have set up a value for money audit system for which many people called over many years. This Government has increased the resources going into the service on a day-to-day basis by almost 60%, yet we still have long waiting lists. However, we should not despair because, if we continue to allocate the resources and address the blockages in the system, I am confident the Minister and the Government will overcome difficulties regarding waiting lists and other procedures.</P>
    <P>During the past 25 years major strides have been made in the technology available to surgeons in our hospitals. Those technological advances create and perpetuate new waiting lists as new procedures are carried out. Many people who heretofore would not have been able to avail of such treatment can now avail of it in the public health sector, and such advances create waiting lists. We must continue to ensure that those in receipt of the public health service have access to a fair and equitable service. It would be disingenuous if we allowed a drift towards a two tier health service, as has happened in other countries, particularly the United States, which did not address the problems presented in time.</P>
    <P>As the demographics here change over the next number of years, greater pressure will come to bear on the public health system, as the present <Col N="794" /> young population moves into the higher risk category. We must put in place the necessary strategic measures to ensure we get ahead in terms of the waiting lists and that as the population grows older we have a proper procedure in place to ensure that they can avail of health services.</P>
    <P>I have raised the matter in other fora of people taking out health insurance. From speaking to my peers and younger people, I am aware that they are not very conscious of the need to take out health insurance cover until such time as they take out a mortgage or move into the workplace. Eighteen year olds or 19 year olds are vibrant and healthy and are not as conscious as older people of the need to take out health cover. We must address that issue by way of advertising or tax incentives. I feel strongly, not only about the need to take out health insurance, but also life policies to ensure that in times of need people cam claim under them. We have failed to encourage young people to take out such insurance in the past. The Minister might address that issue in the broader context of insurance.</P>
    <P>The Government has made an extra £150 million available to the health services since taking up office, which represents an increase of almost 60% in the day to day resources being invested in the services. This level of increased investment will be sustained. The Government has also recognised that the current health infrastructure is inadequate for the delivery of a truly modern and effective service. The total of £2 billion made available by the Government under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 represents almost a trebling of the investment compared with the previous seven year period.</P>
    <P>The serious approach adopted by the Government to health capital funding is highlighted by the fact that this is the first time a national development plan has included health services to any significant extent. The national development plan will bring positive benefits to all sections of our health services and will enable substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure, equipping of acute hospitals and in facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, older persons, the mentally ill and children in need of care and protection.  The thrust of the national development plan is to create an infrastructure that will bring about significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient-centred accessible service.</P>
    <P>Public patients who take up 80% of our public hospital bed capacity will benefit significantly from the investment in this hospital sector. That is an indication of the Government's planning, in particular in the national development plan, which takes account of the demographics and the need to put in place large-scale infrastructural development in the health service. We all remember in the 1980s when it was necessary to reduce public spending and substantial cuts were made in the health services from which we are now recovering. We have the necessary financial resources available to put in place the required <Col N="795" /> health infrastructural development, which is very timely.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome. A health insurance company that has come into this market is concerned about the issue of risk equalisation. Section 10 inserts an exemption from risk equalisation in the case of new insurers entering the market. The period of such an exemption will be three years from the date the insurer concerned commences carrying on a health insurance business. A new insurer will, however, be required to make statutory risk equalisation returns in respect of the conduct of its business for all but the first six months of the exemption period. These returns will not be reckoned by the health insurance authority for the purpose of risk equalisation. While that is welcome, have we gone far enough? If the purpose of the Bill is to encourage and ensure there is more competition in the marketplace to drive down the cost of health insurance cover, we must consider if health insurance companies who wish to enter the market, which has become competitive since the entry of BUPA, will be discouraged by the existence of a risk equalisation scheme, irrespective of the three year exemption class for new entrants to the market.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider that area, given that new entrants to the market will face high start-up costs, they will have to invest heavily in advertising to break the loyalty to the existing insurance companies and they will have to cope with the economies of scales. We will have to reconsider this matter to ensure that we do not discourage new entrants to the market to ensure there is vibrant competition in the health insurance sector, which it is hoped this Bill will help to bring about. If the Minister was satisfied with this aspect, I assume he and his officials have examined it and taken all the factors into account.</P>
    <P>Section 10 goes a long way towards addressing the concern in this area. BUPA has raised a concern regarding risk equalisation. We could not accept insurance companies cherry-picking low risk categories, as is the case in the motor insurance industry. It would be dangerous to go down that road in terms of health insurance. I am satisfied the Bill ensures that every health insurance company entering the market will have to take on all people interested in taking out health insurance, regardless of their risk category.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 5. It provides that in addition to providing to maintain the existing protections for consumers in relation to the setting of premiums on a community-rated basis, it prohibits the varying, on the grounds of age, sex or sexual orientation, of amounts payable by insurers in respect of the treatment and care of insured persons. It is important that we write into legislation and express in this House the need to ensure that everybody should be treated equally in terms of health insurance cover, unlike what happens in the motor insurance industry where companies can cherry-pick applicants. <Col N="796" /> They target the low risk categories, which has imposed a major burden on the high risk categories, particularly young male motorists.</P>
    <P>With regard to broader health policies, the Minister has been vocal and forceful in trying to ensure a reduction in the number of young people who smoke. While we introduce Bills such as this and spend vast resources on health infrastructure and equipping acute hopsitals, we must urgently address the habit of smoking. People began smoking cigarettes simply because they were unaware at the time of the health implications, but research in recent years highlights, in great detail, the risk involved in smoking, particularly when one begins to smoke at a very young age. We must be vigorous in mounting a campaign to discourage young people taking up that habit. The difficulty is that when one is young and energetic and hanging around with one's peers, tobacco-related health problems do not come into the reckoning. We must target young people in primary and secondary schools by introducing a proper campaign on no smoking. We might consider asking sports people and well known personalities to participate in an education video to highlight the dangers of smoking. It is sad to observe that the first thing many young people do on leaving the school premises is to light a cigarette.</P>
    <P>I know more than anyone how difficult it is to give up cigarettes but we must continue to pursue this as a high priority. In recent years we have had a vigorous anti-drink driving campaign which was successful because resources were targeted and advertisements shown. Society has accepted that it is not acceptable to drink and drive and we should now impress the dangers of smoking on the public mind. That has not worked so far and there is no point in kidding ourselves. When people reach 30 or 40 the effects of smoking cigarettes catch up with them because they are short of breath but young people are taking up smoking in droves, particularly young girls. They are under pressure from other areas such as models and advertising agencies. The subtle impression is given that if girls smoke they do not put on weight and they can look like wafer-thin models such as Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell. That puts huge pressure on young girls and we should be conscious of that.</P>
    <P>As I said, sports stars in educational videos might have an impact on young males, as boys are involved in more physical sports and might be conscious that if one smokes one's ability to reach the highest level in sport is reduced. We must be continually vigilant on this as we have a young population. If the percentage of people taking up smoking is maintained there will be a huge burden on the State in 30 or 40 years providing health care for those suffering serious illness because of smoking such as lungs, oesophagus and throat cancer as well as heart disease. For those reasons this should be a high priority.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and has broad support. I am concerned that if we put too many restrictions <Col N="797" /> on health insurance companies we may not be able to get them into the country in the first place. We have a small population and the economies of scale may not be attractive to outside companies. The Government has acknowledged the need for huge resources to be put into health and the value for money audit is something to be welcomed. When we compare hospitals and health board areas we must find where the blockages are. Why are waiting lists not reducing given that £500 million has been invested in the health system? Why is there not a tangible and immediate reduction in waiting lists? Should we be more forceful? Are consultants in hospitals pulling their weight regarding the delivery of a health service to those in the public health system? Should we address that? </P>
    <P>If people are underperforming there should be a mechanism to address that. The public would be very supportive of a system whereby we get tough with people in the health service from the administrative to the medical side. If they are underperforming and do not reach an acceptable standard, there should be a mechanism to sideline them and to ensure that the health service we want for the people is available to them. I hope the Bill is successful in what it is trying to ensure. Only time will tell.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Gerry Reynolds.</P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill in general and do not intend to deal with the nitty-gritty of the legislation, as that was done by the party spokesperson, other than to say that health insurance should be available to those who want to go down that route. VHI and BUPA have made a major contribution to the health service; VHI has done so over many years while BUPA joined the market more recently. It is essential to encourage more young people to take out health insurance early on and, in doing so, to encourage more companies to compete in Ireland for business. Competition has proved valuable in other areas in the past. While it is important that all ages be covered by any company entering the market, we must ensure as many companies as possible can compete to cut the costs involved.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what other speakers have said, there is a two-tier system. The Minister of State is well aware that if one can pay one can get into the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital or other hospitals in weeks if not days. Those with health insurance or cash can get immediate attention but those with medical cards must wait. The budget was an opportunity for the Government to recognise the problems of those who cannot afford medical cards but it was missed. Concessions were rightly made to those over three score years and ten, and that is Fine Gael policy though I would like it lowered by at least another five years. Those under 18 and young families have not been considered, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine a person working for less than £180 per week, which is about the minimum wage, and <Col N="798" /> being told he is not entitled to a medical card if he has a wife and three children. That family must pay a doctor £15 or £20 for a visit and up to £43 per month in medical costs, which is a minimum of £12 per week. A call to the doctor and medicine costs at least £20 per week. This is totally unfair and the level in the means test should be at least doubled for such families to ensure that all young people under 18 are brought into the free schemes.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the amount of money provided for the health service since the Government took office; one speaker said there has been a 60% increase, which is a massive increase in three and a half years. One has to look at the reality. A lot of money has been thrown at the system but I asked a parliamentary question this week about the number of nurses in the health service at present compared to 1995. The answer was very simple. There are no figures for this year but there were 204 fewer nurses in the system in 1999 than in 1995. No wonder people cannot get treatment in hospitals and wards and beds are unavailable. There are not sufficient nurses to man those beds. We may need more hospitals but the least the Minister can do is to ensure there is a proper number of nurses available. The previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, certainly won the battle as far as the nurses' pay increase was concerned. However, the Government lost the war. Nurses who were prepared to come back to this country, who had left because of low income here to take up opportunities elsewhere, did not come back and others left. We have 204 nurses fewer at the end of 1999 than we had at the end of 1995. Is this any way to run a health service?</P>
    <P>The Minister said in this House recently there was a 60% increase in funding and that there were thousands extra involved in the health service. If we do not have the nurses and doctors, we cannot have the service available to make sure that patients are looked after on time. The Government has broken its own guidelines by virtue of the fact that so many people are still waiting 12 months or more to receive treatment they should have already received. Some 587 adults have been waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months. In other words, 74% of those on the waiting lists have been there for more than 12 months, which breaks the Government's own guidelines. They may wait for up to two years but will wait at least for 12 months. For children, the guideline is six months and 87% of those will be on a waiting list after six months. Regarding ear, nose and throat treatment, for adults the figure is 3,105, 62% of whom have been on a waiting list for more than 12 months. For children the figure is 1,538, 73.41% of whom have been waiting for more than six months. Some 819 adults, or 53%, have been waiting for more than 12 months for urology treatment.</P>
    <P>Monaghan General Hospital has been closed down as far as the operating theatre is concerned <Col N="799" /> and the maternity unit is under pressure. The board was advised to close it down and but for politically elected board members, it would have been closed. This hospital is four miles from the Border. It is vital that the cross-Border communities in that region maintain the maternity hospital. There is an opportunity for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State and others to work with the Minister, Bairbre de Brún, to make sure the peace that is thankfully there, is utilised to the full and a maternity hospital is maintained there. It is unreal to think of that region, in a fairly isolated part of the country, being left without any maternity unit. We heard a great deal tonight about the national development plan and all the money available. I beg once again that the Minister for Health and Children should clearly state the Government's commitment to Monaghan General Hospital. The Monaghan region has suffered for more than 30 years from the troubles in Northern Ireland and has not had the opportunities many other areas have had.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make sure funds are committed. I know the health board has been promised overall funding, but it is vital that the promises being made in all sorts of mysterious ways be guaranteed and that we receive that to which we are entitled. If Monaghan continues to be ignored more and more patients will have to be transferred to Dublin hospitals. Beaumont Hospital which serves the Monaghan region has a 45% increase in its waiting list, an increase of 1,053 between June 1997 and June 2000. The Mater Hospital waiting list has increased by 45% as well, an increase of 1,280 patients. St. Vincent's Hospital had an increase of 118%, almost 2,000 patients. In spite of all the money being thrown at the system, the waiting lists grow and patients suffer.</P>
    <P>In the Cavan-Monaghan area, there is a serious problem with suicides and other related difficulties. The Minister should make sure that proper services are available for those that suffer from depression and alcohol related problems. It is not good enough that sick people do not receive the proper care whenever facilities are not available. I urge the Minister to re-examine that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and will raise a few points having read the Explanatory Memorandum. Under the main points it states that:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;(1) The Bill provides for a change in the key definition of a &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo;. In particular, it removes from the scope of the legislation schemes of insurance which are solely concerned with &ldquo;ancillary health services&rdquo; (e.g. out-patient services, general practitioner services and dental services).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that BUPA and the VHI were negotiating on behalf of their members so that these ser<Col N="800" /> vices would be covered under health insurance. I am not as well read on this legislation as I should be but does this proposal mean the legislation will prohibit the voluntary health insurance companies in providing that type of health insurance to members? If that is the case, it is a backward step because companies are trying to put in place a scheme where members of the VHI and BUPA would be allowed to claim for out-patient, general practitioner and dental services. One of the larger costs to individuals paying health insurance, especially members with young families, involves the number of visits they make to their general practitioner, dentist and out-patients service. If I have read and understood this correctly, I oppose it. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that when he makes his reply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to support the financial stability of community rating through allowing insurers discretion to apply late entry premium loading in specified circumstances. It is very necessary and should be dealt with immediately. The establishment of the proposed health insurance authority should happen sooner rather than later. On any opportunity I have to speak on health issues in the House, I express my huge difficulty with the administration of health services. If we are to establish a health insurance authority we should privatise the VHI. Section 5 which provides for a special measure relating to entry by new insurers to the market will also help. We must allow greater competition. It is unnecessary for the State to be involved in health insurance. If we wish to bring in more competitors to a relatively small market and the administration is given to the Health Insurance Authority there will no need for State involvement. I call on the Government to seriously consider privatisation of the VHI.</P>
    <P>The VHI increases over the past few years have been dramatic. Even though most private health subscribers have VHI plan B or the equivalent BUPA cover, they still find it difficult to access health services. They must wait to see consultants and for hospital beds. I know of two cases in the past six months where people were transferred from one hospital to another for medical reasons. Because of an administrative mix-up they were refused cover as it was stated it was for convalescent and not medical purposes. That is appalling. These people had contributed to the VHI for 30 years. Families are vulnerable where a family member is ill. If a general hospital needs an extra bed and a patient is transferred to another hospital for medical care, the VHI say it will not pay for it. That is distressing for the family. It has taken six or seven months to resolve those problems but it is the attitude that bothers me. The VHI's attitude is, even though you may have paid into the VHI for the past 30 years, it will not cover this unless you prove your case. That puts more pressure on a family. This matter should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have said they do not want a two tier system. I listened to Charlie McCreevy <Col N="801" /> state the amount of money he has put into the health services. I compliment him on that. I do not know if any political party has the courage of its convictions but I suggest that 60% of the money given by Charlie McCreevy to the Department of Health and Children is eaten up in health board administration. There are six health boards. In 1975 there were 95 administrators administering the health services in Dublin. Today there is a staggering 11,000. In the greater Manchester area, which is larger than Ireland, there are 3,000 health administrators and there are more hospitals there than in this country. One does not need to be an economic genius to work that out. Even if Charlie McCreevy put all the Exchequer funding into the Department of Health and Children&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the problems would not be resolved. The money is not being spent at the coalface and that is why we have ward closures, waiting lists, a shortage of nurses and people waiting for a year and half to have a hip replacement operation.</P>
      <P>I applaud the fact that the Government introduced medical cards for those aged 70. Fine Gael will reduce this to 65 years. Is it of any benefit to them? I do not believe it is as they do not receive a service. Political parties must look at the way this is administered. It may not be politically astute to say this because there administrators living in all constituencies but there should be an embargo on the recruitment of administrators. We have sufficient. The money should be given to those who provide a service to the patient, the doctors, nurses and orderlies.</P>
      <P>We must look at the way the service is structured. There is a difficulty with consultants. I know the Minister of State was a practising medical person. Although I do not have that experience I know consultants have so many public and private beds. There should be more consultants. The role of doctors, junior doctors, nurses and orderlies must be looked at. It must move on. The way they work is archaic. It will take time and effort but that is where the money should be spent. If we put money into the health services without resolving these issues there will be serious difficulties.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. It gives an opportunity to the VHI to become a private company. We should encourage more health insurance companies into the market to ensure best value for the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a necessary continuation of the deregulation of the health insurance market. It plays a vital role in duplicating our national health services. It gives people an opportunity to provide for themselves and be prudent in taking care of their health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board has, <Col N="802" /> over a long number of years, done a fine job in promoting these worthy aims. However, times change and society develops. Competition is now seen generally, and at European level, as being good for both the customer and society. This Bill is designed to facilitate the further growth of competition within the health insurance market. In particular, I welcome the continuance of the very strong protections that exist in the market to ensure affordable health insurance is available to everyone and that we do not go down the road travelled in other jurisdictions such as the USA and Britain. These protections are community rating, open enrolment, life time cover, the ability to transfer from one insurer to another, without penalty, and minimum benefits. They have served us well and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I have a concern that the provisions to exempt the important areas of primary care from the community rating requirements may lead to the undermining of community rating. It is good for consumers and is vital to underpin the Government aim of having affordable health insurance for everyone. I ask the Minister to address this matter. I do not need to tell the House about the benefits of competition. The Government has been to the forefront of deregulation and the opening of markets to competition, with all the benefits this has brought to the consumer. To date, competition in the health insurance market has been relatively limited and only one new entrant has come into the market to compete with the VHI. Even that limited competition has already brought great benefit to both the market and consumers. For the VHI, it has resulted in a greatly improved financial position in a market with a history of instability prior to competition but which is now more vibrant and stable than ever. Its profitability has increased to levels not seen before. Last year it made an underwriting profit of more than £50 million. Its membership has increased and it recently announced record membership levels. Its claims, as a percentage of its income, has improved every year since the introduction of competition. It has competed vigorously within the market, becoming more user friendly, improving benefits and launching new products. It has proved to be a tough competitor and they have competed vigorously within the market becoming more user friendly, improving their benefits and launching new products. They have proved to be tough competitors in getting the lion's share of young people coming into the market and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>This has been achieved in a market which has become very stable, which continues to grow rapidly and in which the safeguards of community rating, open enrolment, life time cover, free transfer and minimum benefits have operated to ensure there has been no cherry picking. These important safeguards have ensured that the three great fears of a reduction in the market size, older people being forced out of the market or the VHI getting into financial difficulties have not come to pass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> However, what is needed in the market is more competition and to date, we have replaced a monopoly with a duopoly and while that is better than a monopoly, it will not satisfy the needs of society for a competitive market within health insurance.</P>
    <P>While this Bill seeks to improve the framework within which competition can develop, I greatly fear that the proposal to reintroduce risk equalisation threatens not just the emergence of further competition, but the existing competition. Deputy Cowen, when he was Minister for Health and Children, abandoned this scheme and, as we have already seen, no dire consequences have flowed from that abandonment rather the market has continued to go from strength to strength. No evidence has been produced to show the need for such a scheme or to demonstrate how the absence of such a scheme will result in market calamity. It is an unproven measure that has never been introduced in a market with only two competitors and has never been introduced on a scale as extensive as that proposed in Ireland. Its existence in Australia did not prevent the collapse of the health insurance market in that country and it has been abandoned in many states in the United States.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of risk equalisation has been proposed to the Government by its actuarial advisers, Mercers, and has been strongly supported by them. Is the Minister aware that in a report prepared for the Department by the American office of Mercers, they state that the case for or against risk equalisation has not been proven by extensive actual experience. This was said by the Government's own actuaries &ndash; the very people who have proposed this scheme. They went on to state that risk equalisation has been studied repeatedly but not given a fair trial.</P>
    <P>Is the Department suggesting that Ireland and its health services should be used as some sort of guinea pig for an untried and unproved academic concept to test somebody's pet theories? Moreover, it is a concept that has been rejected by the much larger body of Irish opinion as represented by Irish economists, in particular. The continued threat and possibility of such a scheme are seriously deterring other competitors from entering the Irish market. If the Department must have risk equalisation, then it should only be a reserve power if competition is to work in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Strict criteria for its introduction should be put in place in the Bill and should be under the control of the health insurance authority and the Minister. They should be easily understood, required only in the event of market failure, transparent to both current and new competitors and allow people to judge the risks that they are undertaking in coming into the market. It should deal with real problems that cannot be resolved by the market and by the existing powerful protections. It should not operate simply to protect one competitor in the market in an arbitrary fashion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> The perception that the Government, the Department or this Bill is in some way aligned to the interests of the VHI is not good for our international reputation and I urge the Minister to look at the risk equalisation provisions in the Bill. They continue to threaten the limited competition that already exists and they seem to be at odds with the general Government policy of promoting deregulation and competition in pursuit of the public good. The damage that risk equalisation does is clear but without any reason to believe that any benefits can accrue in practice from such a system.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at some of the provisions in the Bill with a view to amendment. The provision that companies which provide health insure free as a benefit for their employees should not be able to insure part of the risk themselves seems to be an unnecessary interference in the affairs of companies and the operation of competition. I understand that risk management schemes are common in many companies and allow companies to have more affordable insurance while managing their own risk. I see no reason they should not be allowed to continue to do this in the area of health insurance.</P>
    <P>I am curious about the provision in the Bill which seeks to impose on those insurance companies which provide cash plans as distinct from health insurance schemes the requirement to pay the benefit from these insurance cash plans directly to the holders of the policies. As things stand, people with these types of insurance policies can assign the benefit from them directly to anyone. Indeed, the ability to assign payment of a debt is a fundamental principle of common law which has existed for centuries. I wonder why this provision has been introduced as it does not seem to have any relevance and deprives existing customers, who have these types of scheme, of a benefit which they should already enjoy.</P>
    <P>What the health insurance market needs is more competition, not less. Competition is good for society and for consumers and needs to be encouraged in every field of business in this country &ndash; not only in airlines, taxis and telecoms but in health insurance, power generation and in the other areas of monopoly that still exist. To achieve more competition in health insurance, we need clarity and certainty. While this Bill is welcome in its efforts to achieve that, I fear it may have the opposite effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to share my time with Deputy Owen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to what my constituency colleague said about risk equalisation and I support all he said. BUPA has set up an operation in Fermoy which is in our constituency. It has entered the marketplace and is providing a very good service. At the same time, I wonder why risk equalisation is seen to be necessary at this time. I am not convinced it is a good thing &ndash; in fact, I have spoken to people in BUPA and they <Col N="805" /> are very concerned about it. They told me it may have the effect of getting them to review their presence in the market in Ireland. If risk equalisation is brought in as proposed, it could have the effect of driving BUPA out of the Irish marketplace and of deterring other such companies from entering it. The Minister has the power to put it in place but I believe it is something about which we need to be very careful.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ahern said, we should put measures in place to attract other competitors into the marketplace. The VHI has done a fantastic job over the years. It certainly needs restructuring and support but we should not do that at the expense of the population and the marketplace as a whole. The Minister might indicate to the House current Government, departmental and ministerial thinking on this matter. Has the Minister looked at all the studies which have been done on this issue? Is he aware of the country by country analysis by BUPA International that this proposal cannot be sustained? Will he tell us why he believes this is so important at this time? We need to encourage and attract others into the marketplace. We must be careful not to do anything which would deter or drive people out of the market.</P>
    <P>Competition is important at every level. BUPA's involvement in the marketplace helps all sides. The number of people who take part in private health insurance has increased dramatically since the arrival of BUPA. People should be encouraged to take out private health insurance as much as possible but it must be affordable and competitive. There is a logic to what I am saying.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of health, despite the Government putting huge sums of money into the health system there are still terrible inequalities and injustices. A man telephoned me recently saying he was in terrible pain and needed a hip operation. I tabled a parliamentary question which was referred to the Southern Health Board and a got a reply about two weeks later informing me that the man would have to wait for two and a half years but that, perhaps if he saw his GP, something might be done. The Minister of State, being a doctor, will have to agree there is something terribly wrong here.</P>
    <P>I also had examples of people in similar circumstances during the past two years who were left waiting. They decided to go around their relatives and family members and managed to get the money together. Lo and behold, miracle of miracles, they got the hip operation done. Why is this? There is a two-track system. I understand the same consultants are involved. There is something wrong with a system that cannot look after people in terrible pain, and those who cannot come out of their own houses because the quality of their life had deteriorated over a number of years. The whole health system must be examined. Money is not enough. The structures in place need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Another man telephoned me three days ago. <Col N="806" /> He was waiting for a hospital bed in order to have a back operation. He was on the public system and was told it might be done in January, July or August. Finally the doctor said he would fit him in on such a date but asked the man to telephone the hospital beforehand to ensure everything was in order. He did so and was told, &ldquo;Sorry, the bed is not available now. Can you ring again next week and we will see?&rdquo;  This man is in agony. He is wondering if the operation will take place before Christmas. He may have to wait until after Christmas and the wait could go on and on. This is not good enough. That person should be given a date and told his operation will take place on a particular day. He should then go to the hospital, be treated with respect, undergo his operation and plan his life. That is not happening. It is an organisational matter. Why cannot this be done? I cannot understand it, except that there are possibly two tracks &ndash; a track for those who have money and a track for those who have not; in other words a track for those on private health insurance and a track for those on public health. It is not good enough that this is happening.</P>
    <P>As an elected public representative these people telephone me as I am sure they telephone the Minister and other Deputies. The constituents expect us to telephone the doctor, surgeon and so on but they are under terrible stress and we annoy them by telephoning them. One particular person said to me, &ldquo;If politicians telephone me what can I do? We are doing the best we can.&rdquo;  It is up to the politicians in power to solve the problem. We are talking about human beings in Deputy McCreevy's £4.5 billion Ireland, to whom this is happening. While the Minister of State is caring and compassionate, and the Minister is doing the best he can, more needs to be done in the organisational structures. That is what is wrong.</P>
    <P>There are consultants who possibly hold on to beds, book beds in advance and hold people in hospital beds who cannot find out when they are to go home. While there is a charter of patients' rights more needs to be done. Patients should be treated with more respect in the hospitals.</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill which seeks to amend the law to ensure competition comes into Ireland. It is a disappointing Bill because it has failed to tackle a number of issues regarding the provision of a fair and equitable health system. There is no doubt we have a two-tier health system. I am an advocate of health insurance and the more people who use health insurance the better. If people are paying for private health insurance the facilities to treat them should be available but not at the cost of somebody who is waiting to receive public health care. That is why the recently published health document by our spokesman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, set out a system which we believe will bring more equity into the health care area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National health systems worldwide can be funded in three different ways: by private finance <Col N="807" /> based on voluntary contributions as in the US where health care is out of the reach of most people; directly from taxation which is the system in the UK, the National Health Service; or by the State from compulsory social insurance which is how much of the health care is paid for in Europe. I continue to hear wonderful things about the provision of health care in France, for example, where nobody is on a waiting list and where staff are waiting to deal with patients as they arrive as opposed to patients having to lie on trolleys, wait for service, wait to get in a queue to be seen by the consultant and finally to join another queue.</P>
    <P>Try to picture a person who came to see me recently in my clinic. He worked all his life until August, in January he was diagnosed with a cataract in one eye and his name was put on the list. He thought the procedure would be carried out and that all would be well. In August the second eye began to give trouble and he now has cataracts in both eyes. He has had to give up his job and has become totally dependent on his married daughter. Every day, after she leaves the children to school, she has to deal with an otherwise perfectly healthy man. He is in receipt of welfare payments. I intervened on his behalf by putting the matter down as an Adjournment debate and I got a response from the Department to say he has an appointment at the end of January at least to get one eye done. I am holding my breath in case when it comes near the date he will get a call to say, &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot take you&rdquo;. He is a healthy man, apart from the cataracts, who has had to give up work and become a burden on the State because the State cannot provide him with the most ordinary of operations that can be carried out in a day care centre. Such an operation would give him back his life and allow his married daughter and her husband to look after their children and family without the worry and concern of her father.</P>
    <P>I also saw a woman last week who has cataracts. Her first appointment to see a specialist is over six months away. In the meantime God knows what deterioration will have taken place.</P>
    <P>Perhaps she will become totally helpless. She is almost totally helpless now and needs care and attention almost all the time. This will put another burden on the State as there will probably be an application for carer's allowance to look after that woman because she will not be able to look after herself.</P>
    <P>Where is the system going? As the old adage says, take care of the pence and the pounds will look after themselves. What are we doing to our health service? We are subjecting people to pain and suffering and damaging the fabric of their lives by making them wait for operations and procedures such as cataract removals. It is frightening to think about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton referred to people waiting two and a half years for a replacement hip operation. If they had that operation within a reasonable <Col N="808" /> waiting time &ndash; they could probably cope with waiting three to six months &ndash; there would be a huge improvement in the quality of their lives and the lives of the relatives who have to take care of them, not to mention the saving for the State.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that this legislation has not attempted to widen the scope of the provision of care. What are the Minister of State's views on the proposals by the VHI to broaden the health products it supplies? It has proposals, for example, to enter into the provision of child care. Will we see legislation to allow it expand into such areas? It is good to open up the market to competition. However, I do not envisage many other insurance firms entering the health insurance market here. Given the size of the country and the number of people who can afford health insurance, the market is probably taken up by VHI and BUPA. I am interested to hear the Minister of State's view on that.</P>
    <P>However, if we are introducing competition, it is important that it will bring genuine rather than illusory benefits to our population and will not allow for cherry picking. I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell who expressed his disappointment that the Government, without any real explanation, has increased the 18 month lead in period proposed in the White Paper on health insurance to 36 months. There is a possibility that a company could use that 36 months to cherry pick. I would like an assurance from the Minister of State that that will not happen.</P>
    <P>I note that much of the legislation &ndash; sections 2 to 7 &ndash; deals with the proposed treatment of ancillary benefits. The Minister of State said that removing ancillary services from the scope of the 1994 health insurance legislation will encourage competition and the development of more substantial forms of cover and improved health status. This is at a time when there is a well established pattern away from in-patient care to day care, out-patient care and primary care, with people going in in the morning, having their procedure done and then going home. It is possible that more substantial ancillary care will follow this trend in a competitive environment.</P>
    <P>It is right to encourage innovation in benefit design by avoiding any form of legal benefit prescription or equalisation fund at this stage. However, if the industry succeeds in marketing more substantial benefits, does the Minister of State think we should retain community rating for ancillary care? If we are to have intergenerational solidarity in regard to hospital care, surely the same must apply to non-hospital care, especially when that type of care is likely to grow in importance and volume. Given advanced technology and increased medical research, more and more people will avail of day care for short procedures.</P>
    <P>I spoke to someone in the health insurance business who told me it is well recognised that insurers can segment the market by various targeting and benefit design techniques. However, it would be more desirable if they were required by law to offer their products to all age and risk <Col N="809" /> groups at the same price. The Minister of State may think that goes against community rating. However, it is important that these products are marketed to all age groups. The Minister of State has considerable power under section 13 of the Principal Act to ensure product availability is made widely known across all age groups.</P>
    <P>We have received information from VHI and BUPA about this legislation, as I assume the Minister of State has. I sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment but I did not get an opportunity to do so, so I will raise it here now. There is a flaw in the Breastcheck system which has been widely publicised by the Minister, Deputy Martin, in regard to women aged 64 years. If they are not &ldquo;consented&rdquo; before they reach their 65th birthday, they are disenfranchised from that service. I ask the Minister of State to take that point on board. The age group selected for Breastcheck is 50 to 65 years. A woman who is currently 64 years of age and finds that the service will not come to her area for another 18 months should not be debarred from getting that service if she was 64 when the service was set up in February of this year.</P>
    <P>The impression has been given, in the announcement of a big extension to this scheme, that areas other than the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North Eastern Health Board and the Midland Health Board will have this service available very shortly. My understanding is that it will take at least another 18 months to two years to finish the three health boards which have been listed. A false impression is being given to people in other health board areas who feel they will be able to get checks very soon. The Minister of State must speed up the process and ensure the necessary resources are there and that women who are currently in their 64th year are not debarred from getting this service. That rule should be changed now.</P>

      <P>In warmly welcoming this Bill for the provision of competition in health insurance, I want to place on record that, despite this competition, a huge cost is imposed on people who wish to obtain health insurance in Ireland. The cost of health insurance, whether with VHI or BUPA, still represents a major burden for families. That is a matter of serious concern. Many people have to place themselves in debt on an annual basis or make major cutbacks in other areas to pay for their health insurance.</P>
      <P>While profit is a motive for the firms in question &ndash; and they are making considerable profits &ndash; we must be careful to ensure individuals are factored into the equation. This is very important and has not been given the level of significance which it deserves. Too much emphasis is being placed on profits and there is a need to row back on that. I wish to share my time with Deputy Belton.</P>

      <P>The VHI has been heavily criticised from time to time. It was established by the then Minister for Health, Thomas F. O'Higgins. To his credit it has stood the test of time and other countries have examined how it has worked. While I do not wish to engage in party politics, it is to the disgrace of the Minister's party that a number of years ago the Government took moneys from the VHI to help the Exchequer when both were facing difficulties. The VHI needed assistance in trying to cope with major problems. Despite the difficulties encountered by the Government, it was inappropriate to take money from the VHI. That exercise set the VHI back to a considerable extent and it was a cause of major difficulties later.</P>
      <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994, was of great benefit to the public. It was also very good in terms of regulating health provision. The Act requires insurance providers to operate in accordance with community ratings, to provide life time cover, minimum benefits, risk equalisation and the registration of undertakings. All are important.</P>
      <P>A visit to any hospital will confirm at first hand that the health services are in crisis. Hospitals are seriously understaffed at all levels, from top surgeons, general surgeons, nurses, cleaning staff and other personnel, such as physiotherapists and radiographers. The shortage of nurses is very serious. For too many years it was impossible to enter the nursing profession but today we have insufficient nurses to meet the demand. This problem must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Children with serious congenital defects, such as a heart problem, should be entitled to medical cards. I have had running arguments with the Minister and his predecessor concerning their failure to provide them. They have said that to do so would contravene guidelines laid down by the health boards. One case I know of involved a baby for whom the parents could not get a medical card. It meant the mother had to give up work and the child had to be brought to England to be operated on.</P>
      <P>There is something seriously wrong when a health board refuses to provide a medical card to a child requiring an operation. There are a number of similar cases across my constituency, some of which involve children with serious long-term health problems. The children in question should be at least granted medical cards and the required operations should be expedited. Given the success of the economy, children and their parents should not have to travel to the UK to have surgical operations. There should be sufficient funding to ensure they are undertaken in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the problems facing hospitals. Members of the Dáil and Seanad are telephoned regularly by people needing hip replacement operations in the hope that we can expedite things. It takes an inordinate length of time to see a surgeon after which patients are put on a waiting list to go on a waiting list. When that happens the patient may have to wait 18 months <Col N="811" /> before an operation is performed. There is something very wrong with a health system that allows this to happen. It must be addressed. These issues are of grave concern to many people.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to become a patient in a hospital for the elderly. While there have been improvements, much more needs to be done. There should be planned investment in homes for the elderly to ensure elderly people are looked after with dignity during their twilight years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of medical cards to all pensioners over 70 years of age. However, it is essential that every old age pensioner be given one. The guidelines controlling the issuing of medical cards must be examined. If a health board refuses to issue one a discretion should be granted to the Minister to sanction one in urgent and important cases where medical evidence indicates that it is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to address the regulation of the private health insurance market and facilitate its development to ensure that Irish consumers have access to a similar range of products and services as consumers in other developed countries. The Government has said the community rating system is the cornerstone of the Irish system. It has been in place for the past 40 years and ensures that everybody pays the same premiums for the same cover, regardless of their age or health. That is why almost half of the population has private health insurance. In other risk-rated countries only 10% to 15% of people have such insurance. This frees up valuable and needed resources in the public system for those who cannot afford insurance.</P>
      <P>Like other Members I constantly hear from constituents who are placed on long public health waiting lists and who are shocked at the length of time it takes to secure an appointment to see a specialist. There is nothing worse in politics than to feel helpless when contacted on a constant basis by people in horrific pain who are on a waiting list for a hip replacement or a knee operation. The Government has the resources but not the will or the know-how to treat these people instead of leaving them on waiting lists for two years. In many cases these are elderly people who can ill afford to cope with pain. They are honest citizens who have worked hard, yet they must wait for an operation. It is hard enough to have an operation without waiting day in and day out to be called for it. The Minister should do everything possible to reduce the waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community rating makes it possible for people to afford effective health insurance throughout their lives. That is why Ireland's community rated market has almost 50% market penetration for health insurance, while the risk-rated UK market with four major health insurers has only 12% penetration. Risk equalisation, which spreads the cost of claims among insurers in proportion to their <Col N="812" /> share of the market, is the foundation stone of community rating, according to all the experts, including actuaries from Ireland, the US, Europe and Australia. It prevents new insurers from cherry picking the least risky subscribers and leaving the higher risks to existing insurers.</P>
    <P>Without a risk equalisation scheme to ensure market stability, community rating would collapse. This could mean that people who had subscribed to a health insurance fund for years could be forced out of the system due to higher premia. A reduction in the number taking out health insurance would not lead to a reduction in the demand for health care but would lead to a reduction in the funds available to pay for it. The only alternative would be higher taxes or longer waiting lists. God knows the waiting lists are long enough already.</P>
    <P>For some unexplained reason this Bill proposes to give new entrants to the market a three year dispensation from risk equalisation. This would undermine community rating and would mean that current members of health insurance schemes would be subsidising a new entrant to the market. The three year dispensation from risk equalisation proposed in the Bill for new entrants to the market is not the answer to attract further competition. Delaying the implementation of risk equalisation will destabilise the market, disadvantage consumers, force older and sicker people out of health insurance schemes, put extra pressure on the public system, devalue a significant State asset, erode trust in the private health care system and decrease investment in health care.</P>
    <P>The young and healthy might see some initial benefits from a delay in the implementation of risk equalisation as new competitors fight for their business, but they would also be squeezed out of health insurance once they got older or sick. Generating more competition and take up of private health insurance in a well regulated market will free up resources for investment in the public system.</P>
    <P>Community rating and risk equalisation is not anti-competitive. It operates in Australia where more than 20 companies compete in the health insurance sector. Increasingly, Governments around the world are turning to community rating with a form of risk equalisation or risk sharing as the most equitable system of health care insurance. Community rating underpinned by a form of risk equalisation operates in various countries. Risk equalisation limits the ability of insurers to profit from risk selection, based primarily on age, but it does not inhibit competition in the area of product design, cost efficiencies and service initiatives.</P>
    <P>A recent World Health Organisation report on health funding praised Ireland's community rated system of payment as one of the fairest in the world. The 1997 Government advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme, which was established by the then Minister for Health and chaired by Gerard Harvey, concluded in its report <Col N="813" /> that risk equalisation is essential to underpin community rating.</P>
    <P>The VHI, which has served generations of families well for more than 40 years, has called for the speedy implementation of the risk equalisation scheme to underpin community rating, ensure market stability and attract further competition. According to my sources, BUPA is doing extremely well in the Irish market. I understand the average age of its membership is 26 compared to an average age of just over 35 for the VHI.</P>
    <P>This Bill also proposes that people who enter health insurance aged 35 years and over may be levied an additional amount on top of the normal community rated premium. This proposal will help to copperfasten community rating. It will also limit the ability of people who have not contributed to a health insurance fund from taking advantage of those who have contributed all their lives. This means that people who wait until they are older before joining for the first time will pay more. It will not affect existing members. If a person is 86 years of age and has been a member since he or she was 21, he or she will still pay the same annual premium as a 21 year old who joins the scheme for the first time.</P>
    <P>I also understand the VHI is seeking a change in the Bill to extend its commercial remit which is currently limited to health related insurance products. This would allow the VHI to respond to market demand for additional products and services, such as child care and occupational health care.</P>
    <P>We must examine the issue of subsidies for private nursing homes so that people at the end of their days will be taken care of and that they will not be afraid and nervous about who will pay and where they will go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill the proposed regulatory regime seeks to impose on the only new entrant we have had to the health insurance system, BUPA which is based in Fermoy, a draconian regime which is designed to stifle competition. It is proposed that the new entrant should make risk equalisation payments to the VHI, which is the long standing monopolist in this field. This is excessive since we already have open enrolment and community rating. To require new entrants to make payments to a long established monopoly is a serious deterrent to new entry. There is a danger that Ireland will not now gain the benefits of deregulating the health insurance market. The great success of deregulation is that it brings new alternative producers and products into the deregulated market and that the previous monopolist responds by shaking off monopolistic indifference to costs and consumers. This Bill generates, as one might expect, much debate about health matters and services. It is about competition, competition policy and insurance law and policy. It does not really deal with the health service as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental difficulty with the Bill is the <Col N="814" /> fact that the Minister for Health and Children is the sole shareholder &ndash; in effect, he is a monopolist &ndash; in the principal company involved in health insurance in this country, he is the regulator and he is the promoter of this Bill which sets out the rules under which the regulator, his own company, and new entrants must operate. The Minister for Health and Children, a majority of the House and a majority of the Irish people may think that that is acceptable because we have been doing this kind of thing for many years. However, the fact that those to whom I refer may believe it acceptable is irrelevant because the ultimate decision will be made elsewhere by institutions which do not tolerate this kind of behaviour, namely, the Commission in Brussels and the European Court in Luxembourg. It is before these two bodies that the Bill will either stand or fall if and when it is enacted.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it will fall if it is passed in its current form and not amended significantly in order to level the playing field. The European Union will not stand for a situation in which the sole shareholder in the existing monopoly company makes the rules by which all others must operate, particularly when those rules are designed not only to put the single existing competitor out of business but also to ensure that there will never be more than one such competitor.</P>
    <P>In a debate on health one is supposed to speak with emotion and gratitude about different aspects of the health services. At times, the VHI almost ranks alongside nurses in terms of the thanks we should give to it. I acknowledge that fact. The VHI did well out of me for over 30 years because I never submitted a claim. I am not, therefore, too embarrassed about having made a few claims in recent years. I hope, God willing, that I may make a few more before the VHI finally writes me off. Some of my constituents feel they were treated well and generously by the VHI over the years while others have a very deep sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>Having acknowledged my indebtedness and that of others to the VHI, I must state that this is a regulatory Bill and that it is not satisfactory. I will not try to stop its Second Reading because it should go before a committee. There is quite an active committee of the House which has taken a fairly sharp view of the provisions of the Bill, of the basic unfairness of the situation and of the rules that are now being written. I hope the committee will amend it in a way that will make it acceptable not to the House or the Irish people but to those who will pass final judgment on it, namely, the Commission and the European Court.</P>
    <P>In the event that the Minister or the Minister of State believe I am merely expressing a vague view as to what are the possible legal consequences, I wish to refer to an opinion written earlier this year by one of the leading authorities in the European Union on these matters. The man to whom I refer, Professor Claus Dieter <Col N="815" /> Ehlermann, is eminently qualified, perhaps more qualified than anyone else in the Union, to express a view on matters of competition law and competition policy. Mr. Ehlermann is currently professor of competition law at the law department of the European University Institute which is situated in Florence. The institute is one of the leading postgraduate universities in the European Union and its president is Dr. Patrick Masterson, former president of UCD.</P>
    <P>Professor Ehlermann is also currently a member of the eight person appellate body of the World Trade Organisation which is responsible for deciding on the most important trade and competition based legal disputes in the world. He was formerly, among other things, director general of the European Union's legal services from 1997 to 1998. Subsequently he served as director general of DG4, the Commission's competition directorate, from 1990 to 1995. As already stated, I do not believe there is anyone better qualified in Europe to express a view on what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have had the advantage of reading the professor's opinion which, as one might expect, is very long and much of the detail might not be of great interest to Members of the House. However, the very succinct and clear conclusions reached by the professor at the end of his opinion must be of interest to Members, to the Minister for Health and Children and to his officials who, I trust, will take them on board between now and Committee Stage. There is not much point in enacting the Bill if it is going to fall in any event.</P>
    <P>The professor reached six conclusions, the first three of which relate to the right of establishment in the Treaty of Rome and also to the provisions of the third non-life insurance directive. I believe I was involved in introducing that directive as President of the Council. The first of the professor's conclusions reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The introduction of the planned risk equalisation scheme would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the third Directive, according to which &ldquo;Member States shall take every step to ensure that monopolies . are abolished by 1 July 1994&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Bill is in violation of Article 3 because, under its terms, we were obliged to abolish our monopolies in this field by 1 July 1994 and six and a half years later we are some way short of fulfilling our obligations. We are now trying to go through the motions of opening the market when, in fact, we are making secure the position of the State monopoly which is owned and regulated by the Minister and which, under our European obligations, we were obliged to abolish by 1 July 1994.</P>
    <P>The second conclusion of Professor Ehlermann is:</P>
    <P>The introduction of the planned risk equalisation scheme would also amount to a violation of Article 43 of the EC Treaty &ndash; the Rome <Col N="816" /> treaty &ndash; which forbids, in principle, restrictions on the freedom of establishment.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, in practical terms a severe restriction on the freedom of establishment in this country. Who would want to establish when one has to do so under the terms set out in this Bill, drawn up by the Minister who is also the principal shareholder of the existing State monopoly?</P>
    <P>Conclusion No. 3:</P>
    <P>The planned risk equalisation scheme cannot be justified by Article 54(1) of the third Directive. Article 54(1) is not at all applicable to a risk equalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister and his Department have argued that it is and that it gives them some sort of exemption. The plain fact is that it does not apply and they cannot use that protection in their argument.</P>
    <P>Professor Ehlermann, in his three later conclusions, considers the situation which arises under the European Union's rules on State aids.</P>
    <P>Conclusion No. 4:</P>
    <P>A payment made according to the planned risk equalisation scheme to the VHI or to BUPA Ireland would be a State aid that fulfils the conditions of Article 87 of the EC Treaty.</P>
    <P>Conclusion No. 5:</P>
    <P>Such a payment would be a new aid. It would therefore have to be notified to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Conclusion No. 6: </P>
    <P>Such a payment could not be authorised by the Commission if it were a payment in favour of the VHI which was financed by a payment or charge imposed on BUPA Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what is proposed here and it cannot be done. One of the leading authorities in Europe on this matter says it cannot be done. Why do the Minister and his Department persist in trying to get this Bill through for the benefit of their own company and to the exclusion of others?</P>
    <P>We may all feel emotional about the VHI and aspects of the Irish health services. However, we live in the European Union and, whether we like it or not, we are subject to its rules. For that I often say, thanks be to God. Thanks be to God the rules are made somewhere other than in the political back rooms and bureaucratic areas of Dublin where they tolerated such awful things for so long. The rules are made elsewhere and they will be adjudged and enforced elsewhere. There is no point in our looking into our little hearts and saying we are cosy here in Ireland, we know the VHI since 1957, it looked after granny before she passed on and will look after the mammy and myself. We are living in the real world and the Minister and his Department will have to come to terms with that. One cannot get away with this kind of stuff in the real world any longer. One could do this when Deputy Tom O'Higgins and <Col N="817" /> many of his successors were Ministers for Health but it cannot be done now.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Health and Children to rethink this Bill before it goes to committee. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who is chairman of the Select Committee on Health and Children. and the members of the committee may want to think carefully about this measure and its implications. There is no point in ploughing on with something because we think it would be nice if it is going to be struck down. It would be better to come to terms with the reality of the treaties under which we now operate and the laws which have been established from those treaties and from the regulations and directives made under them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children and this House are no longer supreme in what they want to adopt. We should adopt something fair and reasonable rather than what is here. We should adopt something that will be seen in Brussels and Luxembourg as fair and reasonable. I can say with confidence that this will not be.</P>

      <P>It would be useful if Members who have heard Deputy O'Malley would reflect on his words. The heads of this Bill were passed by the Cabinet. Given the number of Deputy O'Malley's party colleagues who are members of the Cabinet, one wonders how it accepted the Bill when Deputy O'Malley is so vehemently opposed to it. If the predictions put so plainly and starkly by Deputy O'Malley come to pass, we will have put in place a legislative provision which could be struck down by the European courts. Before we pass this legislation, we should be absolutely sure about its validity. In his useful contribution, Deputy O'Malley has questioned that validity <i>via </i>the comments of an expert on competition policy. We should consider these comments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We are discussing this Bill on the assumption that we have a satisfactory health system and that we will continue as we have for the past 70 years. However, the premise on which this debate is based is false. Some months ago the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, came to his Department with great fanfare, to reform the Irish health system. This innocuous and, as Deputy O'Malley warns, inoperable Bill is the only product of his tenure to date. This is the Minister who was going to solve the crisis in the Irish health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was published my party, in the proposals which we launched two weeks ago, has approached this problem from a different viewpoint. Virtually all public beds available in our hospitals are also available for private patients. Fine Gael believes this is wrong. Deputy O'Malley argues for competition and I accept that people have a right to private health insurance. However, those who cannot afford health insurance also have rights and they are entitled to have their public health system defended. One does not have competition when private patients are taking public beds. If people wish to spend <Col N="818" /> their money in private hospitals I say, good luck to them but they should not take beds which are intended for the 60% of the population who cannot afford private health insurance.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes that each hospital would have to set up an independent board which could negotiate directly with private health insurers for the work they wish to undertake. That seems a fair and sensible suggestion. If Members are suggesting there are great advantages to private health insurance, albeit with the monopolistic powers of which Deputy O'Malley spoke, why do we have the kind of problems which exist in the health service? Will the Minister of State refer to a proposal set out by Deputy Mitchell two weeks ago which suggests a radical change in the health insurance market? We either have a free market or we do not. If we have a free market, those with private health insurance should go to private hospitals and stop taking beds in public hospitals from the 60% of people who do not have private health insurance.</P>
    <P>If one is arguing for the purity of the market, as Deputy O'Malley is doing, then fair enough. However, let us have a market where public health patients go to their own hospitals. This would be the net effect of Deputy Mitchell's proposals because various private health insurers would negotiate directly with hospitals for the services and packages they require. This seems fair and it happens in some EU countries which are closely allied to the treaties spoken of by Deputy O'Malley. If it happens there, it can happen here.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty with regard to Deputy Mitchell's proposal in that it would require a large number of additional private health insurers &ndash; at present we only have BUPA and VHI. Deputy O'Malley stated that the Minister is the regulator but I thought the Health Insurance Authority had regulatory powers on this matter under the 1994 legislation. I stand to be corrected but the net point is, if we are to have a market, and people want private health insurance, they should have it in their own hospitals.</P>
    <P>Everyone is entitled to a basic health care system. However, at present if a consultant is trying to get a bed in a public hospital he can do so. The net effect of this is that someone else who does not have private health insurance is placed further down the list. Let us have a market approach but let public health patients also have their say. Let us have a public health system for public patients.</P>
    <P>All kinds of nonsensical snobbery is attached to private health insurance. I cannot understand the justification for fees and costs which people are charged when they go to hospital. The Health Insurance Authority should investigate the costs associated with putting people through hospital. The situation is not competitive and it is nonsense to suggest we have an open market. Until we have such a genuine market in which there is genuine choice and each hospital has a genuine <Col N="819" /> negotiating capacity with each private health insurer, we will not get the necessary improvements in services.</P>
    <P>For all his talk over the past seven months since his appointment as Minister, Deputy Martin has not delivered on his promises, and we have not seen the kind of radical shake-up of the health system he promised some months ago. This Bill is not the answer to our problems and it could even be struck down if the European court upholds the opinion cited by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>Let us have a system in which private health insurers compete against each other, thereby driving down costs. This has not happened to date as the entry of BUPA has not driven costs down. I accept the Government has increased health spending by about 75%, yet we have not seen any appreciable difference in the service. What kind of vested interests are working within the health industry to ensure that a massive injection of public spending has not delivered appreciable differences on the ground in acute hospitals? The system has to be changed.</P>
    <P>Even in the last year of this Dáil, the Government has an opportunity to think afresh and radically about establishing a private and public health system where hospitals compete for various services. It may be that those who have private health insurance will select the public health option if they find an improvement in services.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State comment on Deputy Mitchell's proposal on Second Stage for a hospital food inspectorate? The standard of food in the public health system is not good in terms of nutrition and presentation. The British Government recently appointed a food tsar who will continually inspect food provided to patients in the public health system. We need a hospital food inspectorate and I endorse Deputy Mitchell's comments on this matter. I hope the Minister of State will respond positively to the suggestion because we have a two-tier system. We have an exceptionally good system for private patients who comprise 40% of the population and in which people are treated in an effective and efficient manner. However, we also have a public system which is in crisis. I hope the Minister of State will take on board the suggestion for a food inspectorate so public patients will be treated with more dignity in hospitals.</P>
    <P>More diseases are contracted in hospitals today than in the past. There was a reference to the super bug but there are a number of diseases in our hospitals. This should not be the case and some kind of inspectorate should be in place to monitor the quality and standard of service of food, cleanliness and hygiene in the public health system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement in the budget to radically expand breast screening programmes and I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government for this measure. However, why was there no similar announcement for a nation-wide <Col N="820" /> screening programme for testicular and prostate cancer, which are a growing phenomena? I raised this issue some years ago when dealing with men's health. It is important that if a screening programme is put in place to deal with the appalling situation regarding breast cancer, a similar nation-wide screening programme is put in place for testicular and prostate cancer which are a growing phenomena and which have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In a recent reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister conceded that, since Tallaght hospital opened, the number of acute beds provided was less than that provided by the four constituent hospitals before they were amalgamated. That is ridiculous. There is a 75 private bed unit expansion to Tallaght Hospital, which I welcome. For the first two years of its operation, fewer hospital beds were available than had been available when its four constituent hospitals were in operation. That is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Given that Tallaght Hospital deals with the west Wicklow and Kildare constituencies, and a growing area of suburban Dublin, we need further acute support in terms of additional hospital space by way of a radical expansion to that hospital or a new hospital to provide for the new suburbs that have been established on the fringe of the city and specifically in the Kildare and Wicklow areas. We have reached capacity in terms of the number of acute beds available for public and private patients within the south west region. The current position is not good enough. We need more acute beds. An additional hospital to serve the greater Dublin area might have to be provided. If so, we should be at that planning stage now, given that two years after the opening of the Tallaght Hospital, which is doing tremendous work, terrible demands and pressures are being placed on it.</P>
    <P>If the Government was serious about dealing with the crisis in our health service, it would propose legislation to guarantee public patients a maximum period of waiting for various treatments and procedures. The point has been made on countless occasions during the debate by Members on all sides of the House that it is not acceptable for those who are in severe pain to have to wait a considerable period, three to five years, before receiving treatment from this State through our public health system.</P>
    <P>We should set out in legislation another proposal put forward in Deputy Mitchell's document, a maximum period of waiting for various treatments and operations. That would guarantee public patients that their required treatments would be provided within a specific period. That could happen, if we changed the fundamental premise of our health system by ensuring greater competition and allowing each hospital to negotiate directly with private health insurers. We need more insurers in the market. It is a relatively small market, but the notion, as outlined by the kind of buccaneer privateer approach, that more health insurers entering the market will result in <Col N="821" /> a lowering of the cost of health insurance is not proved by the facts, particularly since BUPA has come into the equation. I welcome BUPA into the medical care equation here but there is no evidence that costs have reduced or that a better service is being provided for patients. It falls on the State to provide for a public health system for the majority of people, which should be second to none.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government in the remaining time available to it, which I hope will be very short, will examine this situation afresh as opposed tinkering with the problem by way of introducing the legislation before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who spent 15 years of my life as a member of a local health advisory body and health board, I tried to learn a little about the administration of health services here. Despite all my efforts, to this date I am as confused as I was the day I started. One of the first lessons I learned about the administration and delivery of health services was the power of the large hospitals, the power of consultants and the power to dictate policy, to deliver services, to designate the location of hospitals and to determine the speed with which people went through hospitals, etc. We have also had time to observe the UK experience, where similar problems arose. I would have thought that by this stage one of the things we should have learned is that the services are provided for the customers. The population should have ready access to the health services, but they do not nor have they had for a long time, nor does it appear likely that will happen in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Dealing with that problem requires a radical reassessment of the services required and their delivery. As to whether that is done by way of a combination of public and private beds, all public beds or all private beds, when I was a member of a health board I thought that public patients should also have access to private beds by way of an arrangement. I reached that conclusion because that would mean there would be competition in the health services in another form. Competition can act in two ways. It can act positively or negatively. One can achieve one result or the direct opposite, depending on how the system is allowed to work.</P>
      <P>We have a serious problem in that the chances of a medical card holder receiving the degree of attention in terms of access required are slim enough. For example, the average hip replacement patient or cataract operation patient has to wait for a procedure and while they wait they suffer. Nobody seems to care that in very many cases that happens in respect of elderly people. None of us, including the youngest of us, is getting any younger. It would be awful to think that as we get that little bit older nobody would care whether we gained access to the health services to which we have contributed and require or desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that the Bill will do anything to improve the position. I take on board Deputy <Col N="822" /> O'Malley's submission regarding competition and the European Union. From my knowledge of the Union, it does not always apply the competition rules it professes to support. Some of the biggest powers within the Union are the most coy when called upon to apply those principles. In any case of liberalisation and expansion or improvement of the services, the degree to which the risk is carried by those in the health insurance business will have an impact on what happens to the quality and standard of service and to the consumer. The degree of risk involved will undoubtedly be a factor to be considered by those providing the insurance. It is important for us all to consider exactly what happens in practice. We have a community rating under the VHI, which was introduced for a very good reason, to eliminate cherry picking. It would be very easy for incoming and more competitive companies to apply a cherry picking procedure. BUPA has come on stream and has done a good job. It also was bound by similar restraints. I assume that future entrants into the health insurance market will also be expected to have due regard to similar situations. On the point Deputy O'Malley made regarding competition, the European Union does not allow restrictive practice; that is true. At least, it is not supposed to allow restrictive practice. However, quite a number of such practices exist in the EU at various levels and are operated by various countries, not always the smallest nations.</P>
    <P>In examining what we propose to do now, we must take into account observance of the EU rules and directives while at the same time recognising that for a long time patients requiring services in this country have not had access to them to the degree they should. Unless there is a major change in attitude people will leave the country to get those services elsewhere. The Department of Health and Children is already considering this for patients with specific requirements.</P>
    <P>One reason for that is we seem to be bogged down in a health ideology born 40 or 50 years ago, when the population was much smaller than it is now, when patients' expectations were much lower and when the country was vastly underdeveloped compared to today. What was acceptable then is no longer acceptable, nor will it be acceptable in the future. Consumers today expect a faster degree of delivery of service and a higher quality of service. If they are paying, either through voluntary or mandatory contributions, they expect to get the service.</P>
    <P>Our job as parliamentarians is to do our best to bring to the attention of the Minister the need for delivery and that applies on both sides of the House. We must also bring to his attention the failure to deliver in the past. That does not apply to just one Government; nobody has a monopoly on that. The reality is that we got away with this for quite a while. It is no good saying they were able to do no better in Britain. We have a smaller operation and should be able to do better. We should be able to deliver faster and more effectively and we should be more cost-effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> In a few years the age profile of the population will have changed again, which is likely to put a further strain on services. Many young people will be making voluntary health insurance contributions and in many cases there will be very little draw-down for years afterwards. I hope we do not see services curtailed for the aging, greying population at present. I know the Minister of State will say that this proposal addresses this and I hope it does.</P>
    <P>Generally throughout the voting world the clout of that older population, with the exception of one or two countries, is not the same as it was and they must depend on others to deliver for them. I ask the Minister of State to remember that and to try to set higher standards here than have applied elsewhere. Remember the old adage: the customer is always right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. The debate has been wide-ranging but it must be borne in mind that the purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Health Insurance Act, 1994, in the context of enhancing competition in the private health insurance market, in the interests of the customer.</P>
      <P>The need for early establishment of the health insurance authority was raised, as was its composition. The Health Insurance Act, 1994, provides for the establishment of a health insurance authority comprising five persons, including the chairman. The White Paper stated that in considering appointments to the authority the Minister would seek nominations regarding suitable persons from appropriate professionals and representative bodies. This has been done and the Minister intends to establish this important independent authority in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Affording VHI greater latitude regarding the services it can provide was raised and separate legislation will be prepared in due course to address the issue of VHI's future corporate status. Meanwhile, the Minister is considering the approach made to him by VHI, following publication of the Bill, for inclusion of an interim provision regarding services it may provide.</P>
      <P>Regarding community rating and risk equalisation, the best way to explain risk equalisation is in the context of community rating. True community rating means that the risk of major medical expenses is shared across the full market if a community of people opt to purchase health insurance. This means there is solidarity between young and old, healthy and sick, across the whole system. The effective operation of this solidarity forms the very basis for community rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies raised issues regarding risk equalisation but I wish to clarify some matters on which Deputies appear to be misinformed. My Department's insurance actuarial advisers, Mercer Limited, has unequivocally and consistently maintained that risk equalisation is a necessary <Col N="824" /> support to maintain community rating in the competitive health insurance market operated on the basis of open enrolment. In view of comments during the debate it is appropriate to put on record the clear view of Mercer Limited on risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation is fair to consumers who expect that the stability of the system that they have contributed to for many years will be protected. Generally they should not have to pay significantly more for health insurance cover simply because they find themselves with an insurance company which covers a higher proportion of older or less healthy lives. Risk equalisation is fair to insurers. The fact that they have to insure all comers and charge them the same price limits their ability to protect themselves from aspiring claims ratio. Risk equalisation redresses this potential competitive imbalance. Risk equalisation will only result in payments where there are&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State reading the advice given to him or his Department's view of that advice? This is crucial to the debate. Is he reading the advice as prepared by his officials or is that the actuarial advice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no difficulty in providing that.</P>
      <P>Risk equalisation will only result in payments where there are material differences in risk profiles. Put simply, the system requires the healthy to pool their experience with the less healthy. This is true community rating. Risk equalisation limits the extent to which healthier people or their insurers can avoid this responsibility and profit at the expense of the rest of the health insurance consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Risk equalisation is not discriminatory between insurers. It redresses an imbalance in risk profiles between insurers. Any insurer could, as a result of its relative claim profile, be a contributor or a beneficiary of the risk equalisation fund. Risk equalisation is supported by a wide range of independent experts. I emphasise that under arrangements to be made pursuant to the Bill, the Health Insurance Authority will have a considerable role in determining precisely when and how risk equalisation will be implemented. I reiterate that the EU's third non-life insurance directive provided for the application of risk adjustment between insurers, referred to as loss compen<Col N="825" /> sation. I appreciate Deputy O'Malley's interjections in regard to this and we will look at them further, particularly on Committee Stage. In this connection, at all material times EU Commission services were made aware of Ireland's proposals to include risk equalisation in its regulatory arrangements for private health insurance. Prior to publication of the White Paper, my Department engaged in providing Commission services with detailed information on the health insurance regulatory framework, particularly with regard to risk equalisation. Reference was made characterising the criteria to be used in connection with risk equalisation as academic and mathematical. It is only right that any calculation has a sound, mathematical basis. I also emphasise that the criteria being used, age and gender, are universally accepted as reliable determinates as regards health profiles of different populations.</P>
    <P>In addition it is recognised that these factors alone do not fully explain the health risks which different populations can represent, thus making it appropriate to include an additional measure relevant to health status. It would not be the best policy approach to safeguard community rating and the stability of our system to only give consideration to risk equalisation measures when evidence of market failure became established. The whole thrust of the approach to be implemented is to avoid the emergence of such a situation.</P>
    <P>The broad effect of the proposed risk equalisation arrangements will be to protect consumers from the potential adverse effects of differences in risk profiles by bringing insurers with either good or poor profiles closer to the market average. Within this approach there will be provision for generous recognition of the potential of insurers to achieve better claims experience through good insurance practice and efficiency rather than by virtue of having better risks.</P>
    <P>The Minister assures Deputies that the proposed arrangements which will centrally involve the health insurance authority in determining when the circumstances are considered to warrant the commencement of risk equalisation, will reinforce the position that will be exercised very much as a reserved power. It is intended that the commencement of Irish equalisation will be ultimately determined by reference to what is in the overall best interest of health insurance consumers, not the commercial interests of any insurer.</P>
    <P>Concerns were also expressed regarding a 36 months exemption from risk equalisation arrangements in the case of new insurers entering the market. It has become apparent and reflects indications from insurance interests that an 18 months exemption would not be sufficient to encourage entry to the market. It was, therefore, considered appropriate to increase the window period to a duration with greater impact on how potential entrants might view the market opportunity. In this connection Deputies should bear in mind the cost and challenges facing a new entrant <Col N="826" /> wishing to establish in the market, not least among which are the strong brands, extensive health insurance experience and marketing strengths of the two existing players.</P>
    <P>Fears that the window will be exploited have been highlighted. However, the matter has been carefully considered and the Minister is satisfied that the concerns expressed should not arise. The scale of the advantage which any insurer could gain over such a period would be marginal. It is unlikely that any global or established Irish insurer would risk its brand or reputation for such a small potential reward. Furthermore, any new enterprise formed with the specific purpose of trying to exploit this measure would first have to meet the rigorous prudential and other regulatory requirements for conducting insurance business in the State. A number of issues concerning possible effects of the provision of the Bill to remove ancillary health services from the scope of health insurance regulatory arrangements were outlined. I noted with interest the points raised and I will give careful consideration to whatever related amendments may be warranted in this area.</P>
    <P>Some concerns were expressed regarding the public private mix and the view that the position of public patients can be adversely affected under such a system. As stated in the White Paper, the Government is committed to ensuring that public patients benefit from the mixed system and that any potential drawbacks are addressed. To put this matter in perspective, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, notwithstanding nearly 45% of the population having private health insurance, only 21% of beds in public acute hospitals are designated for private patient care. Private facilities are also provided by independent private hospitals which receive no public funding.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 there has been an increase of over 25% in the proportion of the population insured, much of which is attributable to the rise in national prosperity and increase in employment, yet the increase in the proportion of designated private beds in the public acute hospitals has been just 6%. The recent ESRI study commissioned by my Department found no evidence to suggest that elective admissions of private patients to public beds were taking place.</P>
    <P>We should also bear in mind the acute health care needs of a significant number of people are catered for by the independent private hospital sector which has the effect of displacing a potentially significant demand for publicly-funded health services. That said, it is clear there are shortcomings in our system which need to be addressed, including equity of access. The Government is committed to improving public health services and is providing the necessary resources towards that end.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also during the debate to the need for investment to be accompanied by reform. I agree with the need to pursue reform. We must be careful that the manner of doing this does not impact negatively on patients in terms <Col N="827" /> of the continuity or quality of their care. I will provide some examples of areas where reform is being pursued by my Department in partnership with the relevant provider's interest.</P>
    <P>Nursing is a splendid example of where real and substantial progress is being made in pressing ahead with the agenda for change recommended by the Commission on Nursing. This is being done in partnership with all the key stakeholders involved, including the nursing unions. The implementation of the structural reforms advocated by the commission will transform the way in which the nursing profession is regulated, educated and developed.</P>
    <P>The work of the medical manpower forum is aimed at enabling us to move ahead with necessary and effective strategic changes in order to address the key medical staffing and training issues in our public hospitals. There is also important ongoing work to develop a process and culture of quality assurance in our hospitals. This will serve the interests of patients going forward and will ensure that delivery of these services is clearly patient centred.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that the provisions contained in this Bill facilitate competition to the maximum extent possible while protecting community rating. Any risk equalisation payments will arise only where there is real, not academic differences, in the risk profiles of insurers. The statutory scheme which will govern the operation of any such payments between insurers will also have the flexibility in terms of the exercise of discretion on the part of the health insurance authority, to ensure that it will not be commenced without good reason and that it will be proportionate in its application. The approach to these arrangements will have due regard to the overall best interests of all consumers.</P>
    <P>I again thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this Bill. I note, naturally enough, that many of them were extraneous and concerned the general health issues. There will be opportunities for Deputies to address these health issues in regard to the budget debate on health, which keep occuring.</P>

      <P>Our success enables us to project an annual increase of 5.3% in capital investment for 2000-03. The Minister and his colleagues can hardly be castigated for eating the seed corn by virtue of the cuts and welfare increases. Personal taxation reductions will benefit taxpayers by more than £1.2 million. Standard personal allowances increased by £800 for single people and £1,600 for a married couple. The PAYE allowance doubled to £2,000. A single employee earning £144 per week is now outside the tax bracket. That compares to £100 per week before the budget. Some 133,000 people have been removed from the tax net as a result of the budget and 107,000 have been removed from the higher rate. The percentage of all income earners on the top rate of tax has been reduced to 23%. Both the standard rate and the top rate have been reduced by a further 2% in each case. There has been a further widening of the standard tax bands for single, married, one-earner and married two-earner families. Income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over are £8,500 for single and widowed people and £17,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>The main PRSI rate has been cut from 4.5% to 4%. Under 55 rent relief has increased by one-third to £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple. There is a tax exemption of up to £6,000 for rented rooms in principal private residences. All these measures put money into people's pockets. It must increase the incentive to work and contribute fully to society. Giving money back to people frees them to make their own decisions on how to spend it and increase their personal happiness.</P>
      <P>Business taxation measures include a reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income by 24% to 20%. A 12.5% corporation tax rate will apply from 2001 for companies with trading incomes under £200,000 per annum, up from £50,000 per annum. Capital allowances are being increased for plant, machinery and business cars. These measures will enhance the attractiveness of Ireland as a place to do business and give further real incentives to the owners of capital to reinvest at a time of record company profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that the long running difficulties with the credit union movement have <Col N="829" /> finally been resolved and there are now new tax reliefs for credit unions. The movement is widespread and deeply rooted all over the country. It provides valuable lending and saving facilities to people of all classes. It must be recognised that many small business people in urban and rural communities&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the fourth of our five budgets. The cheers and jeers that met the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when he said his first budget was the first of five have disappeared. Since taking office, the Government has helped to stimulate an unprecedented level of job creation and economic activity. In turn, this has allowed us to spend vast amounts of income on the provision of health care, social welfare, education and other services. Over our term in Government, we have continued to deliver on the promises made prior to the election. That is how we should continue.</P>
      <P>We continue to emphasise the importance of caring for families and the elderly. That is why one of the budget's central provisions is the biggest increase in child benefit and old age pensions since the history of the State. Much has been done for various sections in society but more needs to be done. The best way to do that is by having a good economy generating wealth that can be used to provide services for the people. There are many specialist groups such as carers, the elderly, the handicapped, the socially deprived, who still need preferential treatment. Comparing the record of this Government to date with that of its immediate predecessor, the rainbow Coalition, it is the one most likely to provide that preferential treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed last year, and particularly this year, that whenever we refer to the rainbow Government the Opposition's mantra is we are raking over historical facts. I heard that line two nights ago from Deputy Stanton who referred to us raking over history. However, it is recent history. It is insulting to the voting public to suggest that they should not be in a position to compare records. It is only four years ago. Deputy Stanton mentioned three or four issues. He assured me and everyone else that in 1997 this country was left in a very good financial position. I was happy to hear that because when I criticised the increase of £1 in child benefit for the first and second child, I was told money was not available. There is a contradiction there. I am glad to hear there was money available and we must now see why it was not given out. A policy decision must have been taken to say we are raking over history. The <Col N="830" /> public are entitled to question and look back at the figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton suggested that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, was childish to quote figures from the past. The figures should be put on the record for all time. As regards the old age contributory pension, in 1995 pensioners received an increase of £1.80, in 1996 it was £2.20, in 1997 it was £3, a total of £7. By comparison they have received £28 over the same length of time. On child benefit &ndash; I have taken the year 1997 because it was so different from anything that happened before &ndash; there was an increase of £1 for the first and second child. The total increase was £10 for the first and second child and £14 for the third. That compares with the record of Deputy Ahern of £37.50 for the first and second child and £47 for the third. That is almost a four-fold increase. The public is entitled to hear this, not in an historical context but to compare these two records &ndash; you vote for A or B. I suggest B in this case. The present Government has done much better.</P>
    <P>I will put some of the other facts and figures on the record later. This has to do with delivering on promises. I might be wrong but it may have been Deputy De Rossa, a socialist Minister at the time, who gave these figures. Imagine what it would have been like had it been a conservative Minister. It is not being childish but factual and correct.</P>
    <P>The other phrase trotted out is &ldquo;what a lucky Minister for Finance&rdquo;. The rainbow Coalition was over and a new rainbow with a pot of gold appeared. It is the Minister's tax policy that has made the difference. In case the Opposition doubts me, it was good to hear it stitched into the record by no less a person than President Clinton. He did not just say this was the best economy in Europe, he went further and said it was one of the leading ones in the world. He referred to our policies. I am sure the public will be interested to hear that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has followed a very consistent pattern. He started when he cut taxation in one category in his first year. He came back the second year and showed he had doubled the take to the State. They are the type of policies we want. In Nice last week, our colleagues in Europe tried to change our taxation structure. The reason is that we take seven out of eight jobs coming from America and elsewhere because of our tax structure. That, in turn, is putting money in the coffers beyond what we would expect with our population. It is also creating jobs and priming the economy with income tax.</P>
    <P>When it was put to Arnold Palmer that he was a lucky golfer he said that the more he practised, the luckier he got. It is the same with the Minister &ndash; the harder he works at it, the better the economy gets. He should get credit for that and I am proud of what he is doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady mentioned sorting out outstanding issues. There was conflict with the credit unions but the Minister is capable of dealing with <Col N="831" /> any problems that arise. He has shown that he is also a considerate individual by giving taking account of the position of fostered and adopted children and of those who paid stamps pre-1953. He has dealt with issues which Ministers have failed to deal with for the past 25 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton criticised the Minister for taking the investor out of the housing market. I presume by that he meant the person who was buying five or six houses for the purpose of letting them. I am glad the Minister has taken action in this regard and that he has given the first time buyer a level playing pitch on which to play so that they will not be up against the moneyed people of this country. I am glad that as a result of his decisions, Peter Bacon was able to announce to the Cork Chamber of Commerce last week that he expects house prices to drop by between 10% and 15% next year. Deputy Stanton described those people who buy five or six houses as investors, although another name for them is multiple house purchasers. I am glad the Minister has ensured that young people trying to buy for the first time are taken care of.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding features in this budget was the treatment of the elderly. During my career I have had the privilege of serving the public in many capacities, one of which was as chairman of the Southern Health Board. During that time I met many elderly people who were sick with worry about the cost of health care and the fact they might have to pay for hospital care. The greatest breakthrough since we decided on free secondary education many years ago was the decision to treat over 70s as a special category and to give them free health care by allocating to them the medical card. I plead with the Minister to try to lower the age limit next year to those over 65 years of age. We should bear in mind that we are speaking about the people who gave me and others the chance to be elected to this House. They are the people who built this State and they deserve everything we can give them.</P>
    <P>The additional money for child benefit represents a real advance. There were arguments about giving child benefit across the board and that some people who do not need it would benefit. The fairest way for the State to assist families is through child benefit. It goes directly to the most important person in the home, the mother, who is well able to handle it. Means testing can be a crude and costly method of redirecting resources. I commend the Minister for Finance on his budget and wish him well with next year's budget. He has exceeded all his targets and whatever we get next year will be a bonus.</P>

      <P>The last speaker referred to housing. I support the Minister's comments on the Bacon report &ndash; I would like to put my little tatoo on the record. I suggest to Deputy Dennehy that he speak to Deputies Flynn, Ellis and Doherty. I received a letter a number of weeks ago to the effect that those Members want to and are going to change it. In my reply I quoted the record of the Dáil proceedings of 27 June when I voted with my party. If this issue comes before the House again, I will not vote with my party but with the Government on the basis that its view on this issue is correct. We will give Deputies Ellis, Flynn and Doherty and the Independents the opportunity to vote with or against the Government bearing in mind that in the letter quoted, which they signed, they stated they are going to get this matter changed.</P>
      <P>It has always been Fianna Fáil policy to say one thing in the Chamber and something else in the constituency. That was the case with the Ministers of State, Deputy Ó Cuív and Deputy O'Dea, and now we are seeing it again with these Members from the west but then, what should one expect? </P>

      <P>I remind my colleagues, because they have bad memories, that there are more than 50,000 people on the housing waiting list. About 8,000 will sleep on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Wicklow and elsewhere tonight in plastic bags and boxes. They will not have a bed in which to sleep. Is that the kind of society those in Govern<Col N="833" /> ment want? Is that the kind of Government that is in charge of the country? </P>
      <P>In Mayo, 1,300 people do not have a toilet in their house and they have to go out to the field or out the backdoor and Government Members are lecturing everybody about our wonderful economy. Of course, it is a wonderful economy when the richer are getting richer and richer. They are getting richer because the Minister for Finance is in the wrong party, although he has the right partners in Government &ndash; the Progressive Democrats. We know for what the Progressive Democrats stand. They do not stand for fair play; they speak, work and are in Government for the rich. They have certainly worked for the rich in this budget.</P>
      <P>We talk about young people having a house. There is a £3,000 grant for the first time buyer and stamp duty levied at 9%. I accept some people do not have to pay stamp duty if it is their place of residence. Why did the Government not increase the grant from £3,000 to £15,000 or £20,000 when the money is available? If one went to any part of this country, whether Mayo, Dublin or Wicklow, one could not buy a three bedroomed house for £100,000 and yet ten years on, the grant for first time buyers is still £3,000. Why did the Government not do something for those people? While Mr. Bacon has dealt with it, investors are coming into this country and buying six or seven houses. More people from Wicklow than locals own houses in Mayo.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should listen to me, although he may not like what he hears. He will get his opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>I want to give an example of how daft this country and society has become. There are tax breaks for seaside resort schemes and so on under section 23. Investors from all over the country are coming in to buy property. They get the tax break from the Government and for the winter months the health boards have to rent the property from investors for poor people who cannot get a home. They get the tax break from the Government for the summer months and they are paid by the health boards for the winter months. What kind of society is that? It is a two-tier society from which the rich gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process with regard to infrastructure and planning does not work. If one applies to Dublin, Wicklow or Mayo county councils for planning permission it is supposed to be decided within two months. On the last day of the two months one may get a letter from the local authority requesting further information. That means a further two months wait. There are not enough planners to deal with applications. Yet we are being told this is a wonderful economy. Young couples have to wait six or seven months to get planning permission while house prices continue <Col N="834" /> to rise while the Government does nothing about it.</P>

She was crying. She said she was 74 years of age and had worked all her life for the State and had never asked anything of the State. She said she was in receipt of a contributory pension and wanted a cataract operation which she cannot get. She cannot see with her right eye and her left eye is beginning to give trouble. She asked if I could do anything for her. I said I would do my best; I did not want to dishearten her. She has been waiting for months on end.

      <P>This budget was announced in the media over the past few months and every Minister tried to highlight his or her good points in discussing it. We knew before Wednesday what the budget would bring. One of our biggest social problems relates to the abuse of alcohol. President Clinton arrived in Ireland this week and everybody went out to see him but I did not go. The place for him to meet the members of parliament was in the Parliament. It was a disgrace that both the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children who has responsibility in the area of alcohol abuse had to show again the image of the drunken Irish by bringing him to the Guinness brewery. Why could he not be invited to the Irish Parliament to meet those Deputies who represent the people? Why had he to be taken to the Guinness brewery, which was a means of promoting drink? Last night I saw on television that Ireland is the second highest in the world in relation to its consumption of alcohol. The programme also stated that given the way we are going about it, Ireland will probably be number one in the next few months. It is no wonder, because we are sending out the wrong image and the wrong message to our young people. We should have had the President of the United States of America in this House, not in the Guinness brewery sending out the wrong message to young people.</P>

      <P>I will say what I think about the budget. The budget shows what the Government thinks about this country. It does not have the political courage to lead. President Clinton might have praised this country. However, we know that the minute the shareholders in America decide it no longer suits them to invest here, they will pull the plug as they pulled it before, when the ten years of grant aid are up. It suits them now to be here but it might not suit them in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has to deal with the serious problem of the abuse of alcohol and drugs. He should spend less time flying around the world and more time in the country trying to deal with that serious problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. Deputy Ring touched on many of the key issues when he said the budget expresses the values of the country and the plan the Government has for the nation. The first question one must ask is what values this budget expressed and what plan for the nation was shown in the decisions taken in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never before, as Deputy Ring said, was there such an opportunity to make an assault on poverty. This budget could have made an enormous difference to the quality of life, particularly for the most vulnerable. This was an opportunity to <Col N="837" /> use our resources to make a difference and to create an equal society.</P>
    <P>Report after report have stressed recently that we are a very unequal society. Many other countries when they became wealthy, as this country has, used their resources to make their societies equal and to provide better services for those who need them most. The question is whether we did that in this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I will quote from a number of organisations. The Carers' Association talked about the Government's disgraceful neglect of carers. The Disability Federation of Ireland disagreed sharply with the Minister from Cork, Deputy Martin, in regard to his views on what had been done for the disabled in this budget. Another group which analysed the budget, the Conference of Religious of Ireland, stated that the poorest people were betrayed as the budget favoured the better off, increased the divisions in society and failed to honour PPF commitments. The INOU, the organisation dealing with the unemployed, made the same point. The St. Vincent de Paul society, which deals with thousands of the most needy people every day made the same analysis.</P>
      <P>Can all these organisations and people who have analysed the budget really be getting it so wrong? I do not think they are. Key decisions were taken in this budget which ignored those who needed resources most.</P>
      <P>A headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated &ldquo;In terms of kindness, rich Ireland's budget is poverty stricken&rdquo;. These headlines tell a story. When one analyses the decisions taken in the budget, one sees very clearly that certain values were promoted, which said that we do not care particularly if we create a more unequal society and that we are not particularly concerned with the issue of equality in the Ireland of 2001.</P>
      <P>I will give a couple of examples of this. Let us take the question of the £8 increase in the rates of social welfare. Inflation has been running at 6.8%. The increases in social welfare last year were predicated on a 3% rate of inflation. People who are dependent on social welfare have, in fact, been losing out all year because of the increase in inflation. As the compensation package put to the Government by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was rejected some weeks ago, they have been losing out continuously. When the time came to allocate the resources, an increase of £8 was given in social welfare. That means, in effect, that the widow's contributory pension for those under 66 years is now £89.10, the invalidity pension is now £89.10, the personal rate of the carer's benefit is £96.50 and unemployment benefit is £85.50. This is at a time when we know that costs are escalating out of all proportion. The basic costs of food, clothing, transport and heat are all increasing, yet there has been an £8 increase in social welfare.</P>

      <Col N="838" /> This was an opportunity to deal with relative poverty in this country but it was simply not taken. A clear choice was made to reduce the top rate of taxation rather than increase the lowest social welfare payments, despite the inequalities. The people will show, in due course, that they are not happy with that choice. For example, a recent public opinion poll showed that people wanted the gap between rich and poor reduced. The Government could have shown political leadership in this regard. It could have made a real difference.</P>

      <P>I will deal with that in a moment. The Government could have made a real difference to people who are the most needy. A recent survey showed that 70% of disabled people are living in poverty. That is the reality. Resources could have been allocated in that direction, which would have made a difference.</P>
      <P>Another survey, the EUROSTAT survey, which was published a few days before the budget, showed that Ireland is at the bottom, and remains so after the budget, in terms of what we spend on social welfare and social protection. That is the choice of the Government, and it remained so in this budget. Sweden spends twice as much on creating a just society as we do. Countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Germany spend around 30% of GDP on social protection. The EU average is 28%. Ireland spends 16% of GDP. The next worse performer, Spain, is still far above us at 22% of GDP.</P>
      <P>The carers, the disability federation, CORI and the St. Vincent de Paul society are not inventing this material. The reality is that we are not putting our resources where they are needed most. The budget did not put resources where they are needed most in this Celtic tiger economy. Many people have been left behind and this budget created even more divisions.</P>
      <P>I will talk now about the 133,000 people who were taken out of the tax net. The interesting point about that is the fact that so many of them are on such low wages. Another interesting point is that 155,000&mdash;</P>

      <P>By the Minister's own estimate, we have 50,000 carers in this country. In fact, the true figure is probably closer to 180,000. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs accepts the figure of 50,000. Only a tiny proportion of those people receive any money from the State. The vast majority of carers are completely unrecognised, from a financial perspective, by the Government. A small number were brought into the scheme in the budget but the vast majority of carers will still receive no money or support, despite the fact they save the State hundreds of thousands of pounds. Whatever happened to community care? In a little noticed piece in budget 2001, for example, the Minister for Finance has made it easier for people to claim tax relief in respect of the cost of maintaining relatives in nursing homes. This is welcome as the arrangements are cumbersome and apply only to relatives with low incomes. Reasonably generous tax relief will be available for maintaining relatives in a nursing home and for employing somebody to care for an incapacitated relative, but very ungenerous income maintenance and tax relief arrangements will apply to people who look after incapacitated relatives in their own homes. Support will not be given to those who do the work of carers at home but it will be provided to institutional care. Surely that should have been examined in the budget and a cost of care payment based on a needs assessment and the work being done in the Western Health Board should have been introduced.</P>
      <P>This budget should have made a difference. A cost of care payment for those looking after those in need, incapacitated, ill and elderly should have been introduced. Once again it was a missed opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Ryan, is concerned about child benefit. If the national children's strategy is to mean anything it is time for the Government to set a minimum income standard for children. The Commission on Social Welfare set one for adults but it has never been done for children. The expectations around child benefit appear to be so enormous it is time to introduce one. The Combat Poverty Agency estimates that the cost of rearing a child per week is <Col N="840" /> £36.45. Current child benefit rates do not meet that. There is a considerable gap, which has huge implications for low income families. Many families would say it costs much more than the figure indicated, given the increase in costs and demands of children of all ages. The minimum cost, which does not include child care, does not reach the minimum income level required.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs need to consider what should be the minimum income payment for children. So much is expected from child benefit. It is expected to deal with child care and is viewed as an anti-poverty measure, which it is. I welcome the increases, but they should have been higher in view of what has been expected.</P>
    <P>There is a need to progress on the issue of child care. The programme the Government is concerned with needs to be implemented. Families must get real support and choice, especially in the early years. Better maternity benefit is required. It should be increased to 20 weeks. There should also be paid parental leave.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous surplus in the social insurance fund. It is time to be imaginative with it by improving benefits and making it a real insurance scheme and not just another tax on people. It is time to look at the kind of parental leave that can be introduced. Women are mostly involved, but it should cover parents who want to take time out in the early years. It is time to make choice a real possibility. The money is there in the social insurance fund. This is the time to use it imaginatively to introduce new benefits and allowances.</P>
    <P>Once again, the disabled did not get the kind of resources they need from the budget. I have referred to the study done on poverty and disability and the close connection between the two. Huge issues of access to public transport and jobs need to be addressed. Much work remains to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>At a time of enormous resources, a huge surplus and very serious inflation, the budget was an opportunity to make a difference, create a more equal society, to allocate resources to those who need it most. The Government did not grasp this opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his excellent budget. Unlike previous speakers I believe he has given great hope to the many people who have found themselves on the margins, including those who have found it difficult to care for themselves, who wanted a health service and interactive local government, and to those on social welfare and the elderly. He has ensured that substantial sums of money have been put aside in the budget to deal with the issues they face in their everyday lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the sums being debated in the budget, the challenge now is to manage the huge expectations of the people we represent. We must also address the challenge of ensuring that the vast sums of money allocated to the various Depart<Col N="841" /> ments is filtered down to where it matters on the ground and that such bodies as the health boards and local government not only take up the funding but begin to make it work in a cost effective and efficient way to deal with the problems I and previous speakers are highlighting.</P>
    <P>The health budget of £5.3 billion, set aside to fund the health services in 2001, represents a 23% increase in spending. A sum of £72 million has been set aside for services for the elderly. The South Eastern Health Board must prioritise Government policy on the provision of care for the elderly within the south-east region. Recently the health board made applications valued at £84 million for services to the elderly. It received £15 million in the current year. A step down facility is needed at St. Luke's hospital in Kilkenny. The Castlecomer community hospital needs to be prioritised to keep people in care in their local area. This will cost £2 million. A sheltered housing scheme is promised for Castlecomer. These plans are included in the health board spent, yet this year the board has failed to draw down the requisite funding.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children must ensure that these schemes, together with those that will renovate and modernise Thomastown hospital for the elderly in Kilkenny, will be given priority. The home for the elderly in Kilkenny city is another priority. We must focus on all these problems. We need to get the health board to work with us to ensure that the money allocated will deliver the services on the ground.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 billion in the budget has been allocated for local authority and affordable housing. If we are to spend that we need to get local communities on side. In this regard a local County Kilkenny village of Mooneenrow has been interacting with the local authority under the stewardship of Fr. Joyce. It is regrettable that with regard to an application it submitted in 1999 to provide affordable housing, further information was requested at the last moment. The group was criticised for the plan it submitted and was effectively told the officials in the council knew more than the group about what the village required. That is not good enough because it harms the progress made at local level. It does not implement the spend set aside by the Government. Fr. Joyce and others in his local community know as much as the county council officials about what they want for their community.</P>
    <P>A correction needs to be made to the planning process to allow such communities to deal in a proactive way with their problems by getting their land and affordable housing. A fast track planning process is required to allow them to solve their problems in a realistic way by availing of the £1 billion that has been put aside by the Government for that purpose. The planning process needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Youth services were mentioned in the budget. Counties throughout the country provide youth services at different levels. County Kilkenny is on <Col N="842" /> a par with other counties in this regard although it needs funding. I have made the case to the Minister and the neighbouring County Carlow has made an application in respect of the youth information services. There is an application for the purchase of a building in partnership with the local authority. That type of capital funding should be made available through this budget to organisations which will spend it for good purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>This debate is opportune, given that tomorrow the Minister for Health and Children will launch a report on the needs of teenagers in Dublin's north-east inner city which was commissioned by the Lourdes Youth and Community Services and which, regrettably, paints a gloomy picture of many of our young people in this part of the inner city. Some of the findings of the report are as follows: 88% of the sample group left school before completing the leaving certificate; 52% left without a junior certificate; 60% were suspended from school at some time; 63% were in low paid low skill jobs or were on training courses and 26% were not in any employment or training. I will not go into the findings of the report on crime and drugs which have already been well documented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scandal and tragedy about this report is that it is but one in a long series of reports drawing attention to the desperate social disadvantage of this community and specifically to the unacceptable inequality of opportunity in education affecting young people in this part of Dublin. My understanding is that several studies over the years have shown that this inner city community has the least number of children of any area of Dublin or the entire country who get the chance to go on to third level education. Well below 5% of the young people go to university <Col N="843" /> while across the Liffey in Dublin 4 the norm is that at least 55% go to third level institutions. That is a stark example of inequality.</P>
    <P>There are Dublin Corporation flat complexes in this area which have not seen one child get through to third level education. Some of these flats have the highest level of early school leaving in the State. It is important to state that a small number of young people, some of whom I know, have, despite all the obstacles presented to them by a neglectful State and a socially destructive environment, achieved the impossible against all odds and obtained third level degrees. However, they are few and far between.</P>
    <P>Ironically, this area, which suffers such appalling educational disadvantage, is where the Department of Education and Science and the Minister's office are located. Yet, incredibly, that Department has not attempted to formulate a policy response to tackle the area's dreadful social injustice. Is it any wonder that a recent internal report in the Department by Mr. Seán Cromien states that the Department has &ldquo;little local presence&rdquo; and that there is a &ldquo;vagueness about where in the Department policy is formulated and whose responsibility it is to formulate it, if any policy exists&rdquo;? There is no policy in relation to this area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>While there are a range of schemes intended to address educational disadvantage throughout the State, the strongly held view of all the community interests in the north inner city is that the only way to formulate a comprehensive policy with the objective of achieving equality of opportunity in education is to establish a task force on educational disadvantage specifically in this area of the north inner city. Everything else has clearly failed, as evidenced by the Lourdes Youth and Community Services current report to which I referred. ICON, the Inner City Organisations Network, recently made a detailed submission to the Minister urgently requesting the setting up of such a task force. The experience of the drug problem in the same area demonstrated that it was only when a similar task force strategy was initiated that any progress was made.</P>
    <P>This scandal of inequality of educational opportunity is far bigger than any scandal around which tribunals have been established, particularly at a time when there is such affluence and enormous budgetary surpluses which provide the opportunity to do something meaningful to address this injustice. There are an increasing number of job opportunities in the centre of Dublin, particularly with the expansion of the International Financial Services Centre and the ongoing renewal of the docklands. However, the bulk of the better jobs are beyond the reach of most of the local young people because we have failed to provide them with the education to which they are entitled as a constitutional right.</P>
    <P>I have raised this issue on many occasions in this House over the past 18 years with several Ministers for Education without result and the <Col N="844" /> injustice continues. I urge the Minister, if he reads my comments tonight as he is not present, to give a commitment to take the necessary action and establish a task force without further delay. I presume I have the support of the Taoiseach in this matter as he also represents this community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>A submission was made to my Department on 18 March 1999 that resulted in a meeting with the representatives of the Inner City Organisations Network on 5 May 1999. A further meeting was held between the social inclusion unit and the integrated services process development and monitoring officer and chairperson during May 2000 to further discuss the issue of establishing an education task force in the ICON area. The latest submission was received <i>via</i> the Taoiseach's office on 13 November 2000 requesting a meeting between the assistant general secretary responsible for social inclusion and ICON representatives. The Minister for Education and Science has asked officials to arrange a meeting at a mutually suitable date as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have a specific budget to support the work of a localised group, such as that proposed by ICON. However, my Department is making a significant contribution to address the education issues in the north inner city. My Department is represented on the integrated services process by a primary inspector who works closely with the chairpersons of both education task groups and links with the education co-ordinator in the Dublin inner city partnership, of which the principal officer of the social inclusion unit is a member. An inspector represents my Department on the education and training sub-committee of the partnership. In addition, my Department provides a full-time education officer post to the education and training sub-committee of the partnership who is involved in developing responses to tackling educational disadvantage and identifying gaps in provision.</P>
      <P>My Department has a wide range of supports in place to promote school attendance / retention / second chance education for pupils in Dublin inner city in addition to a broad range of adult education / literacy / community programmes. Rutland pre-school, all 12 primary schools in the ICON area, three second level schools, the two Youthreach centres located in the area and the extensive range of educational opportunities available through the City of Dublin VEC benefit from the many initiatives my Department has put in place to counter educational disadvantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter as a result of a parliamentary question I tabled on 21 November on the Folklore Commission. Many Members are probably not aware of the existence of the Folklore Commission. However, when I was a young <Col N="845" /> boy 50 years ago I recall it collecting material from the older generation. It did that through recordings on gramophones and by taking information down in long hand. It got people's experiences of what life was like in the middle of the 19th century. Indirect knowledge probably dates back to the 18th century or earlier as a result of traditions and stories which were passed down by word of mouth.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to learn that the works of the Folklore Commission were given to the department of Irish folklore at University College, Dublin in 1971 and that they are now the property of that university. I was informed in the reply to which I refer that there are 2,300 bound volumes in the main manuscripts and 1,100 bound volumes in the schools' collection and that there are also approximately 1,120 boxes of unbound material. The latter consist of a collection of sound recordings on gramophone discs, audio tapes, photographs, film and video tapes and a variety of plans, sketches and diagrams.</P>
      <P>I am asking that this material, which was collected by the Folklore Commission since the foundation of the State 80 years ago, be distributed to the county and city libraries throughout the country so that people can gain access to it. It is a great pity that this material is not available locally. Later in the reply, I was informed that it can be examined at the Arts Building in Belfield on weekdays. That is reasonably helpful but most people with an interest in this matter do not want to come to Dublin to study items such as those contained in the collection. Schools, local newspapers and libraries should all be given access to this material. It would be of massive benefit to this country and its people, in terms of preserving our heritage, culture and history, if we could gain access to the first-hand experiences of those who witnessed events surrounding the land wars, the Land League, the Fenian uprisings, the Famine and the War of Independence.</P>
      <P>I am requesting that this material be disseminated by University College, Dublin, to libraries in cities and towns where they can be examined and studied in order that people can learn from it. Unfortunately, many people do not appreciate local history until they become older. We love to listen to people who are 20, 30 or 40 years older than us and who have wonderful recollections about past events which we value. People are not learning from the recollections contained in the folklore department at UCD which date back 80 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am familiar with a man who frequents one of the many public houses in which I drink. This individual is about 70 years of age and he has an incredible store of knowledge about local history which has never been recorded in any book or newspaper. He gained this knowledge from his grandmother who was born in 1856 and who, in turn, had an incredible recollection of events from the middle of the 19th century. She also picked up knowledge of local history from her <Col N="846" /> parents and grandparents which dated back to the mid-18th century.</P>
    <P>We are losing out on a large part of our culture because we are not particularly proactive in this area. I ask the Minister of State to make available the material to which I refer and to make a conscious effort to have it distributed in order that it might be gainfully used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Folklore Commission was set up by the Government, at the instigation of Éamon de Valera, in 1935. It was responsible for the collection, preservation, study and exposition of all aspects of Irish folk tradition. Its establishment built on the earlier foundation of the Folklore of Ireland Society in 1927 and the establishment of the State-supported Irish Folklore Institute, 1930-34.</P>
      <P>In 1971, on foot of the recommendation contained in the Report of the Commission on Higher Education, 1967, the Government transferred the commission's holdings to University College, Dublin. Funding for the new operation, to be carried out under the name of the department of Irish folklore, was channelled to UCD through the Higher Education Authority. Over the years the commission had assembled a large and important collection of source material and UCD was given responsibility for its preservation and publication.</P>
      <P>To assist UCD in discharging this responsibility it was agreed between the Department and UCD that an advisory council should be set up to represent their joint interests. It was further agreed that the council should consist of ten persons, six to be appointed directly by the president of UCD and four to be nominated by the Minister for Education and Science. It was also agreed that the president of UCD would appoint one of the ten members as chairman.</P>
      <P>In addition to teaching Irish folklore at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, the department of Irish folklore at UCD &ndash; in direct continuation of the work of the commission &ndash; undertakes the collecting, classifying and study of all aspects of Irish folklore. The holdings of the department of Irish folklore include two manuscript series &ndash; the main manuscripts, amounting to over 2,300 bound volumes, and the schools' collection, amounting to over 1,100 bound volumes, together with 1,124 boxes of unbound material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range and scope of the collections embrace not only all aspects of folk narrative tradition folk customs and beliefs, but also the entire field of material folk culture as well as folk music, song and dance. It contains significant amounts of folklore from every Irish county and is representative of the whole island of Ireland. There are also collections of sound recordings, both on gramophone discs and audio tapes, photographs &ndash; about 100,000 &ndash; film and video tapes and a variety of plans, sketches and diagrams. Approximately three quarters of the manuscript and sound holdings are in the Irish language, most of the remainder are in English. The collections also <Col N="847" /> contain material in Scottish Gaelic and in the Breton and Manx languages.</P>
    <P>The main bulk of the materials was assembled by full-time collectors working for the Irish Folklore Commission and these collectors were thoroughly familiar with the dialect and lore of their respective districts. The school scheme was carried out in the 1930s by primary school children aged 11 to 14 who followed carefully prepared guidelines and covered most of the country.</P>
    <P>Since 1975, under the aegis of Comhairle Béaloideas Éireann, 17 main titles and three pamphlets have been published in the series <i>Scríbhinní Béaloidis &ndash; Folklore Studies</i>. As well as publication of material, the department of Irish folklore is also involved in occasional promotional activities to increase public awareness. These include: public lectures, workshops at summer schools, radio and television programmes and newspaper features. Photographic exhibitions and college days are also organised.</P>
    <P>The Irish folklore collection is housed, as Deputy Deasy stated, in the Arts Building in Belfield and is accessible to members of the public, students, researchers, etc., free of charge. Almost 1,000 individuals visit the department each year. Visitors to the collection can obtain photocopies of material but are not allowed to publish any of the information obtained without permission. The Irish folk music section of the collection is housed at Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
    <P>Material from the collection is also available in certain third level institutions to students, scholars and researchers but may not be published without the permission of UCD. Material for publication must be cleared by the department of Irish folklore but permission is granted in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>UCD has advised that for various reasons it is not possible to make the main manuscript collection available to county libraries. In particular, there are considerations concerning the sheer volume of records contained in the collection and the sensitive nature of some of the material &ndash; it is understood that it may include information on specific individuals &ndash; in the collection. Unlike the schools' collection, the materials in the main manuscript collection are not accessible on a county by county basis.</P>
    <P>Members of the public can access the schools' collection through their county libraries, all of which have been supplied with microfilm copies of the locally relevant material. This collection has proved to be a most valuable asset in local studies and school projects.</P>

      <Col N="848" /> The aim of Scoutlink and the project development team is to provide a permanent jamboree for peace and reconciliation at the Castle Saunderson site along the Cavan Fermanagh border, which is adjacent to the Belfast-Galway road between Clones and Cavan town. Scoutlink is an umbrella group formed to fund and manage this major project, bringing together the three scouting bodies operating on the island of Ireland: Scouting Ireland, CSI; Scouting Ireland, SAI; and the Northern Ireland Scouting Council. These bodies have a total membership of approximately 55,000. That number, together with leaders, trainee leaders and helpers could run to 70,000.</P>
    <P>No other project will encompass so many young people taking part in activity. This is truly a millennium peace project with young people from every part of this island taking part. This means that people of all religions and none can meet and enjoy each other's company. Scouting associations also seek in every way to support those young people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In 1993, in the midlands of Ireland, 8,000 scouts from 25 countries took part in an international jamboree. Imagine the potential of Castle Saunderson to bring tourism and spin-off jobs to this Border region through this type of international involvement. The restoration of the castle and church is surely a heritage project so this means a number of Ministers must be involved to cover tourism, heritage, youth and education.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must lead this project as no other project can so truly be classified as a cross-Border youth related peace project. This site can be used in the long-term for other groups such as the community games. It must be funded as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The scouting project team estimates the capital investment of £9.7 million is required to bring its proposals to full fruition and it can be covered in five phases. When fully operational it will need £875,000 in annual costs and it is estimated that it will produce annual revenue of more than £1 million. Funding has already been raised in the United States and there is opportunity for private donors, statutory bodies and investment funding agencies. It will foster peace and reconciliation among scouts and non-scouts alike. If other bodies, such as community games are to use the site, it will become a much larger project and more beneficial to the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation must pull together the different Departments and make sure no stone is left unturned in funding this project. The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance must make sure funds are committed. Funding should not be left to INTERREG lll and Peace and Reconciliation 2000-2004, as suggested by the Minister for Finance in a reply to a parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Castle Saunderson project is to promote the development of young people in achieving their full potential, physically, intellectually, socially and spiritually as individuals, responsible citizens and members of local, <Col N="849" /> national and international communities; to provide a permanent jamboree campsite for local, national and international scouts; to serve as a centre for cross-community dialogue which will lead to reconciliation; and to serve as a focal point, due to its unique location on the border between Cavan and Fermanagh, to facilitate the sharing of resources among scouting organisations and youth associations throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is in the prime position to spearhead this major project. I look forward to his support and assistance. I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle appreciates what I am trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister McDaid thanks the Deputy for raising this issue and he shares his views that the energies and dedication of the scout movement should be supported whenever possible in the provision of a range of appropriate facilities. Minister McDaid understands submissions for funding have been made to a number of Ministers. Earlier today, in the company of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, the Minister met representatives of Scouting Ireland, CSI, the scouting group which is the driving force behind this ambitious project which, as the Deputy is aware, is to provide for a cross-Border cross-cultural activity centre for the youth of Ireland. Minister McDaid explained to them that as the project was of such magnitude and as some aspects of the proposed development impinged on a number of Departments, consideration of the application for funding would have to be addressed on a cross-departmental basis.</P>
      <P>There are several programmes under which funding for the project could be considered.</P>
      <P>Under the sports capital programme operated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, grants are awarded to voluntary and community groups for the development of sporting and recreational facilities. For the 2001 sports capital programme, advertisements will be placed in all the national newspapers tomorrow inviting applications from any sports and recreational organisations for funding in the next round of the sports capital programme. The closing date for the 2001 sports capital programme will be Friday, 9 February at 5 p.m.</P>
      <P>There is a new peace operational programme 2000-04, which replaces the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation which covered the period 1995 to 1999. The operational programme covers Northern Ireland and the Border region to the south consisting of counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Monaghan, Cavan and Louth.</P>
      <P>Funding of 500 million has been committed by the EU to the programme and 20% of that funding is in respect of the Border region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme recognises that there is a continued need to promote actions which remove barriers to reconciliation and break down community divisions within both jurisdictions and between North and South. Much can be done by <Col N="850" /> bringing together interests, groups or individuals who have been separated by the conflict for co-operative and joint actions.</P>
    <P>North-South institutional arrangements developed under the Belfast Agreement are an important factor in the relationship between both parts of the island and the new programme is designed to underpin these positive developments. Specifically, the programme will support economic and social activities of similar nature on both sides of the Border and a minimum of 15% of total funding will be dedicated to joint North-South projects.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new peace programme were prepared jointly North and South earlier this year and submitted for consideration to the European Commission. The expectation is for development work on the programme to be finalised in early spring and to invite proposals for projects shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>As proposals stand, support for a range of cross-Border activities will be provided. Such activities will have to be provided jointly to attract funding from the programme. The areas of activities will include youth, sport, culture, business and economics, arts, social inclusion, public service provision and delivery and co-operation in the agricultural, rural development, fishery and tourism sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been approached and he explained in a recent parliamentary question that proposals for funding of a permanent jamboree campsite at the Castle Saunderson Estate in County Cavan for Scouting Ireland have been received and are currently being considered in the context of developing and promoting North-South relations. This consideration will explore the opportunities for funding the project under either of the two new EU supported pro grammesfor cross-Border co-operation, namely INTERREG III and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 2000-2004. The Minister for Finance understands the authorities in Northern Ireland have not been approached with a request for similar funding.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Finance has been active in his support of the scouting associations in recent years. In 1999 he approved a capital grant of £400,000 to Scouting Ireland towards the cost of their new national headquarters.</P>
    <P>Officials from the youth affairs section of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Reconciliation and I met the CSI on 28 June 2000 to discuss the Castle Saunderson project. The CSI organisation outlined their proposals for the estate and made a request for funding for the project. In the course of an extensive discussion on the project it was explained that there is no capital funding available to the youth affairs section of the Department which would enable the Department to make available a grant towards the extensive refurbishment programme involved.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the youth services grant <Col N="851" /> scheme operated by the youth affairs section of the Department, grants-in-aid are provided on an annual basis to voluntary national and major regional youth organisations throughout the State. The aim of this is to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people. Such funding is intended only to help meet their day to day running costs and staff costs.</P>
    <P>Scouting Ireland, CSI, currently receives funding under the scheme and in the four years 1998 to 2003 an amount of £1,015,408 was awarded to that organisation. In addition, the funding of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation towards the cost of Scouting Ireland, SAI, the other scouting body in the State, under the youth service grant scheme has amounted to £761,410 over the same period. Furthermore, the youth affairs section also funds the Federation of Irish Scouts Association, the organisation which represents both scouting organisations at international level.</P>
    <P> This project will be considered for funding on a cross-departmental basis and, as the Minister explained to representatives of Scouting Ireland at today's meeting, he will be considering how best to have the application considered on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to express my disgust at the temporary release from Castlerea Prison in recent months of each of the four of the murderers of detective garda Jerry McCabe. I cannot understand the reasoning which led to these temporary releases. They are described by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as being on compassionate grounds. Each of them appears to be based on the alleged illness of a family member. To say the least of it, the reasons for their release are very dubious and almost certainly would not be adequate if these people were not members of the IRA and did not have the other part of the IRA, Sinn Féin, lobbying for them. The lobbying is done for them by other convicted terrorist criminals.</P>
      <P>It was made abundantly clear prior to, and at the signing of, the Good Friday Agreement that the benefits of that Agreement would not extend to these four people. Notwithstanding that, their releases are described in some quarters as &ldquo;confidence building measures&rdquo;. I would have thought we need to build confidence in the legal system, particularly the criminal justice system, and not confidence among the members of an organisation which has spent several decades murdering, maiming and robbing people on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State acknowledged in the House yesterday that discussions had taken place with Sinn Féin about these prisoners and how <Col N="852" /> they would be treated. I doubt if the Department or the Government would enter into discussions with any other political party a member of whom had been convicted of killing a garda on duty. Why do these people get special treatment? Would a freelance, unattached murderer of a garda get this treatment? The answer is unquestionably no.</P>
    <P>If compassion is to be shown it might first be shown to those who themselves demonstrated some compassion. What compassion did these thugs and their associates show to Jerry McCabe and Ben O'Sullivan on that awful morning in Adare? Why should these people be shown constant favouritism?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats is deeply disturbed by the action of the Minister in releasing these people temporarily. It looks to us as if this is simply the gradual build-up to their eventual premature total release. If the Minister requires, through legislation or by way of motion, the agreement of this House for further favourable treatment for these people and their associates, support for such a measure will not be forthcoming from the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>These four people have been convicted of extremely serious crimes and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of up to 14 years. Why are they not in Portlaoise Prison? This is the appropriate place for people convicted of this type of offence and nowhere else is appropriate. Is it at the request of other convicted criminals in Sinn Féin that they are now enjoying themselves in Castlerea Prison in an individual bungalow of their own, with telephones paid for by the taxpayer and the IRA sending down the town for Chinese or other take-aways whenever the normal diet is not to their liking? Why are they allowed the privacy of living together in one house which was described in newspapers as a luxury bungalow with the freedom to talk, by telephone at least, to anyone they want, anywhere they like and at any time? Are they using this access to the outside to plan further crimes and to give instructions to their less experienced associates in Sinn Féin and the IRA as to how certain serious crimes might best be carried out?</P>
    <P>When moderate democrats who seek to abide by and uphold the rule of law come a bad second in Government esteem to these kind of people, it is surely time to ask ourselves some fundamental questions about how we order our affairs. When the lives of our policemen, and the welfare of their widows, come second to the creature comforts of these sort of people, we may find ourselves quickly in a position that the thin blue line disappears and our society and its institutions are put at grave risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that this matter was the subject of Private Notice Questions yesterday at which I dealt as comprehensively as possible with the matters raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I fully appreciate the concerns expressed in the House about the releases in question. No one could deny that the prisoners involved were party to a dreadful and brutal crime in Adare which shocked all right-thinking people. It is all too understandable that the family of the late detective garda McCabe, in particular, are distressed that the people in question have been granted short periods of compassionate parole. It is only right that Members of this House in whose constituency the family lives have been to the fore in raising concerns about these releases in the House.</P>
    <P>The reality is that no Minister for Justice would have lightly decided to authorise compassionate parole in these cases. In many ways the easier thing to do would have been to refuse the applications in question. As I informed the House yesterday, ten such applications from the prisoners in question had been turned down by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    <P>Wider considerations arise. To have refused all the applications in question would have amounted to a departure from normal practice which in the view of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, could not ultimately be justified. The High Court has found that it would be unlawful for a Minister to impose a blanket ban on releases for a particular group of prisoners. Each case must be considered individually by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the House that the releases in question were unprecedented. This is simply not true. In this context it may be worth making the point that one of the prisoners in question was released early by the previous Government substantially in advance of the completion of the sentence he was then serving. During the course of the time he spent in prison he received compassionate parole on seven occasions. I am not criticising those decisions but it serves to illustrate the point that very difficult decisions have had to be made by successive Administrations in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is important to reiterate a number of points. First, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated on many occasions that the persons convicted in connection with the death of detective garda McCabe do not qualify for release under the Good Friday Agreement. That remains the position and to suggest that the granting of short periods of compassionate parole in any way contradicts the assurances given is entirely misplaced. The four prisoners in question were each released for three days compassionate parole in a period of about 22 months of their sentences. Clearly that does not represent early release.</P>
    <P>Second, no breaches of the conditions surrounding the releases have been reported to the prison authorities. I mentioned yesterday that inquiries are being made into the allegation that one of the persons involved was found by gardaí after hours on a licensed premises.</P>
    <P>While the inquiries are continuing I should tell <Col N="854" /> the House that the prisoner involved denies having been in a bar while gardaí raided it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he run into the yard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the inquiries indicate that a breach of the conditions may have occurred, it would be a matter for the prison governor to pursue the matter by way of disciplinary proceedings. Any reported breach of conditions of temporary release could have serious implications not least in relation to consideration of any future applications for parole. There are also sanctions available to prison governors should a breach be proved, including loss of entitlement. Equally, while breach of a condition attaching to temporary release might not be at issue, the suggestion that one of the prisoners booked into a hotel with a particular person is also denied by that prisoner. For the sake of clarity, one prisoner was released on compassionate grounds last weekend, not two.</P>
      <P>Third, there have been suggestions in the House that the releases in question arise as part of some secret deal entered into with Sinn Féin. There is no basis for that suggestion. Representatives of Sinn Féin regularly raise the case of the prisoners at meetings with officials. Their strongly expressed view is that those prisoners qualify for release under the Good Friday Agreement. As Members are well aware, the Government holds an opposite view. As with members of all political parties, from time to time representatives of Sinn Féin have made representations about authorising periods of release in particular cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Fourth, it has been suggested in the House that the use of the term &ldquo;compassionate parole&rdquo; is wrong. I said yesterday it is not a term I would use, especially in this case. What is at issue is the temporary release of the prisoners. The prisoners in question were granted short periods of temporary release under rules made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. Those rules apply to all prisoners released from Castlerea Prison. While it does not appear in statutory form, the term &ldquo;compassionate parole&rdquo; is used by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform simply to describe releases that are warranted on compassionate grounds. Generally, the criteria relating to compassionate parole arise from some family circumstance, say, an illness of a family member, which is considered sufficient grounds to warrant the authorisation of a period of parole. It is not the practice to disclose the specific reasons for such releases in individual cases, not least because this could require releasing sensitive information about a family member. Clearly, what is at issue is not early release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> There are three further issues which it is important that I deal with. The first relates to notifying the family of the victim when such releases take place. As I informed the House yesterday, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in the particular circumstances of the case, has asked that a procedure be put in place to ensure that the family is informed should the situation arise again.</P>
    <P>The second relates to suggestions which have been made to the effect that different standards have been applied in these cases than would apply to other prisoners. I assure the House that each case for compassionate parole is assessed on its individual merits and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be satisfied on the basis of the information available to him that the granting of parole is warranted by all the circumstances surrounding the application. Suggestions which were made here yesterday to the effect that one doctor provided medical certificates in all the four cases are not true.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The third relates to the regime which applies to the prisoners in question at Castlerea Prison. The prisoners in question were transferred there when it was concluded that they could be held in less intensive settings from a security point of view than Portlaoise Prison, which is our sole maximum security prison. They are subject to the regime at the prison and, of course, prison rules apply to them. The prisoners in question are held in a group in a compound within the walls of Castlerea Prison, which has been in operation for over three years.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy O'Malley for raising this matter this evening. I fully understand the concerns which he has about this matter. I assure him that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is acutely aware of those concerns and will fully take them into account.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 15 December 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a core policy goal of my Department to reverse the decline in the use of Irish as the principal means of communication in the Gaeltacht and to extend the use of Irish in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>To examine the health of the Irish language, in terms of usage and competence within the Gaeltacht, broad terms of reference have been given by the Government to the recently established Commission on the Irish Language in the Gaeltacht. The first term of reference of the commission is to establish and analyse from available data including the census of population returns and statistics from Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge administered by my Department the extent to which Irish is the spoken vernacular in the various Gaeltacht areas. As the Deputy is aware the usage of Irish varies throughout the Gaeltacht &ndash; areas being strong and weak in varying degrees.</P>
      <P>As regards the usage of Irish in the State in general the results of the 1996 census of population indicate that a total of just over 1.43 million persons aged three years and over were recorded as having an ability to speak Irish and over a quarter of those who indicated that they could speak Irish were reported as speaking it on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The position of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht is of concern and that is the reason that a commission was established to make recommendations to Government with regard to strengthening the Irish language as the spoken language therein.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the replies to the question on usage of Irish in the 1996 census of population that there is a strong foundation of Irish speakers in the State on which a bilingual society can be developed. To achieve this concerted action will be required by the State and it citizens. My Department, Foras na Gaeilge and the Irish language organisations will have a major role in the matter. A key action being undertaken by my Department at present is the ongoing work on the preparation of a language Bill, the Official Languages Equality Bill, which will give legislative effect to Article 8 of the Constitution regarding the Irish language and which will provide for the improvement of the availability of State services through Irish throughout the country.</P>

      <P>While no survey or research has been carried out on the level of interest in archaeological excavations in the medieval core of Dublin, members of the public, schoolchildren, tourists and scholars of the period in Ireland and other countries all take an interest in the results.</P>
      <P>Temple Bar Properties which carried out the most recent excavations in this area under licence from my Department have produced a series of summary reports on the results of their excavations entitled Archaeology in Temple Bar. In addition, public viewing of the Essex Street excavation was well received. Artefacts from these excavations are included in a permanent exhibition on findings from the Viking period in the National Museum of Ireland. Research findings and artefacts from earlier and later excavations are on display in the Dublinia and the Viking Adventure Centre run by Dublin Tourism, in association with the National Museum of Ireland. These centres attract many foreign and local visitors and help to present this rich archaeological heritage to a wider audience. Summary accounts of all licensed archaeological excavations can be found in the excavation bulletin series, which have been supported financially by my Department. These publications are available from all good booksellers. Seminars have also been held and the proceedings published under the editorship of Dr. Sean Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These excavations have been of invaluable benefit in that they have greatly extended our <Col N="859" /> knowledge and understanding of the development and everyday life of Dublin in the Viking-Anglo Norman periods. The historic core of Dublin is of international importance given the remarkable state of preservation of organic materials such as house foundations and other timbers. Such knowledge and information has obvious spin off-benefits for cultural tourism as I have already outlined, but more importantly, it assists us in devising policies and strategies for the protection of the archaeological heritage, a resource that is non-renewable and is therefore very precious.</P>

      <P>While I am responsible for wildlife conservation in Ireland, and specifically for maintaining the favourable conservation status of species naturally occurring in the wild my role in relation to game management-propagation is concentrated on deciding on open seasons for huntable species and licensing hunting to ensure that wild, naturally occurring species are hunted in a sustainable way. All gamebirds are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and may not be hunted save during a limited open season. Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service of my Department <Col N="860" /> is not engaged in restocking for any of the species listed on the open seasons order. Restocking of certain species, particularly pheasant and mallard is carried out by gun clubs and by the National Association of Regional Game Councils.</P>
      <P>A range of initiatives is in place to promote the conservation of game species which are subject to pressure. Grey partridge is now close to extinction and my Department has provided major support to a grey partridge research and conservation project. Dúchas has from time to time offered advice to game interests who are interested in developing strategies for the propagation of game species.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the conservation of the habitat of these species will be improved by the designation by my Department of large areas of land as special areas of conservation, special protection areas, natural heritage areas, under both EU and domestic legislation. Measures such as the rural environment protection scheme promoted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, other agri-environment measures and changes in policy relating to afforestation of peatlands. will further benefit these species.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor my officials have met the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on this matter in recent years.</P>

      <P>The once off £1 million announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget for the Ark Cultural Centre will help support a practical but visionary action plan which has been developed by the Ark to extend its services. The ark has been very successful since it opened in 1995 and is now regarded as a centre of excellence of arts provision for children. However due to this very success its building in Temple Bar has reached operational capacity. The new action plan, which is costed at over £2 million has the aim of extending access to the arts programmes and activities of the ark through the development of innovative outreach and touring initiatives and through the use of information technology. In particular the action plan will promote initiatives to provide access to the arts for children that for reasons of social or economic exclusion, ill health or special needs cannot access the programmes that take place in the current Ark building in Temple Bar.</P>

      <P>The Screen Commission is under the aegis of the Irish Film Board and I do not have any statutory functions regarding its ongoing operations.</P>
      <P>The incentives for the use of Irish locations include the section 481 tax scheme, which the Government extended for a five year period with effect from April 2000, and the Irish Film Board production loans scheme. I am pleased that I was able to increase funding this year for the film board by £1.1 million in the current year by way of Supplementary Estimate. The provision for the board in 2001 will be £8.75 million, more than twice the provision in 1997. The production infrastructure here has been strengthened and the skills-base expanded, facilitating international production here. Ireland of course offers a wide variety of spectacular, diverse and accessible locations along with highly qualified film crews, and excellent post-production facilities and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 report of the IBEC Audiovisual Federation indicates that a total of 22,258 employ<Col N="862" /> ment placements occurred in film and television productions in 1998, of which 95.7% were Irish. Direct and indirect employment amounted to some 3,235 full-time job equivalents.</P>

      <P>Arts and culture initiatives on the islands are encouraged in a number of ways both directly by my Department and by Údaras na Gaeltachta. For example, my Department is financially supporting the development of an arts centre on Inis Oirr under the cultural development incentive scheme. Island communities were eligible on an equal basis with everybody else to submit proposals for funding for capital infrastructure initiatives under the Access scheme. My Department also provides arts and culture grants to various island groups for activities such as the holding of island festivals and the mounting of exhibitions by island artists. The grants awarded in 2000 are outlined in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>I do not have the information requested by the Deputy and have no responsibility for providing information on the condition of buildings.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within the next two years and the complete national inventory within a period of 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within <Col N="863" /> its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals that affect them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>I explained to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 355 of 21 Samhain 2000 that, in view of the depth of feeling around the issue, it seemed prudent to me in the circumstances following the decision by An Bord Pleanála to refuse planning permission for an entry point to the Burren National Park, to provide space for calm reflection on the search for a solution which would command broadly-based support. I believe that the time is now right to start the process and arrangements have been made to meet at official level with Clare County Council in the near future to open exploratory talks to establish in general what options may exist in the whole north Clare area.</P>
      <P>This issue is an important and complex one, and the necessary time must be taken to get it right. Clearly, all relevant views must be factored into the deliberations that will take place and, when the available options have been identified, ample opportunity for consultation must be provided for all interested parties. In the meantime, I will be happy to receive proposals or views from anyone who feels they can contribute to resolving this issue, and any views received will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>Ar iarratas uaimse, tá Údarás na Gaeltachta faoi láthair i mbun oibre ar dhearadh agus pleanáil aerstráice d'Oileán Thoraí. Tuigim ón Údaras go bhfuil i gceist acu iarratas ar chead pleanála don aerstráice a dhéanamh ach ráiteas thionchar timpeallachta a bheith curtha i gcríoch acu roimhré. Chuir mé in iúl don Teachta i mo fhreagra ar Cheist Uimhir 195 den 10ú Deireadh Fómhair 2000 go raibh an obair ar an ráiteas sin tosaithe cheana féin agus rabhthas ag súil go mbeadh sé críochnaithe faoi cheann ocht seachtainí. Tá curtha in iúl dom anois ag Údarás na Gaeltachta go mba éigean don chomhlacht a cheapadh chun an staidéar a chur i gcríoch tarraingt amach as an gconradh a bhí acu leis an Údarás agus gur chuir sé seo moill ar an bpróiseas dá bharr.

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 131 and 329 of 14 November 2000 an examination is being carried out on the submissions received to determine and record the issues raised and to analyse the overall trends in the submissions. This process is ongoing and I hope to have this phase of the evaluation process concluded by the end of this year. Its outcome will establish the need, if any, for more focused consultation with the sector to inform the development of a new legislative framework for the arts which I intend to introduce by way of an arts Bill in 2001.</P>

      <P>One of my central objectives as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is to make the arts accessible to all sectors of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the barriers to providing access to the arts has been the deficit of high standard arts and culture infrastructure particularly in the regions. This infrastructural deficit is being addressed by <Col N="869" /> my Department which has co-funded 37 arts and culture capital projects under the cultural development incentive scheme, under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999. This scheme has already made a significant contribution towards improving access to the arts in every region of the country.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to be able to secure funding of £36 million for a new capital scheme Access &ndash; arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme &ndash; over the years 2001-04. Over 170 applications for support under this scheme have been received and are being examined. I expect to be in a position to announce funding decisions on this scheme early in 2001.</P>
    <P>Access to the arts also continues to be an underpinning objective for the Arts Council and under its Arts Plan 1999-2001 it undertakes to work with every local authority in the country in fostering participation in and building audiences for the arts.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to recent reports of the very high percentage of young persons driving cars without insurance; and if she will take immediate and appropriate action to eliminate such irresponsible behaviour so that the high insurance costs currently imposed on young, legitimately insured drivers can be significantly reduced. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any indicators of a very high percentage of young persons driving cars without insurance. The National Roads Authority carries out surveys on parked vehicles on behalf of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, which compensates victims of untraced accidents or accidents caused by uninsured drivers. The surveys since 1987 have shown a consistent fall in the percentage of cars detected without insurance. The NRA feel this is due to the now compulsory requirement to display insurance discs and the greater enforcement by the Garda. As the surveys <Col N="872" /> are carried out on static vehicles they do not give any indication as to the age of the drivers.   </P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the number of notified claims to the MIBI increased by 57% in the five year period to 2000 and payments in that period increased from £18 million to £33 million, an increase of 82%. The increase in costs is not directly attributable to an increase in the level of compensation but rather to an increase in the cost of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>
      <P>It is also worth stating that the figure of increased claim notifications to the MIBI contained an increase of 98% in the number of claims relating to untraced accidents, or so-called &lsquo;hit and run' accidents. These accidents do not necessarily involve drivers without insurance cover.</P>
      <P>The high delivery costs of personal injury compensation was identified in a Deloitte &amp; Touche report as the main contributory factor to high insurance costs in this country. Following on from that report a special working group was established to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the group's report it is hoped to bring proposals to Government as quickly as possible with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation by streamlining the claims process.

      <P>The Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Act, 2000 allows for payment of a lump sum of £20,000 each to certain former employees who had been employed in the company for a period of not less than two years which was a period of continuous employment and continued to be so employed on 1 November 1986 or later.</P>
      <P>Since the Act was passed in July last, the number of eligible applications that have been finalised and paid is 139. A further four eligible applicants will be paid before Christmas. Some 12 applications are still being processed and the documentation is awaited from these applicants.</P>
      <P>With regard to the person concerned, the committee established under the Act has reviewed his application. Much correspondence with the personal representative was necessary in this case to seek to establish the relevant facts. The committee found that his application is ineligible for the payment because it does not meet the requirements of the Act. In particular, there is insufficient evidence to meet the requirement of being employed by Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited on 1 November 1986 or later. In the circumstances, his application has been refused. He will be notified of the refusal of his application within the next few days.</P>
      <P>The Act provides that any refusal may be appealed within 21 days of the receipt by him of the notification.</P>

      <P>The Port of Waterford Company is one of eight port companies charged with a commercial mandate to manage, control, operate and develop our commercial seaports. These ports handle in excess of 99% by volume of Ireland's external trade. The port of Waterford's Belview <Col N="875" /> terminal is one of four container ports in the country.</P>
      <P>I support, as does the port of Waterford Company, the general strategy of utilising the public private partnership contract model for appropriate contracts. The port company has advised my Department of its concerns about the imposition of hard tolls on the second river crossing at Waterford. This, in their view, could have an adverse effect on haulage to and from the port in what is already a price sensitive business and thus result in a possible loss of trade to the port particularly if access to and egress from competing ports is not similarly tolled.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the proposal for the imposition of tolls will, in any event, be the subject, under the Roads Act, 1993 as amended by Planning and Development Act, 2000, of a toll scheme prepared by the National Roads Authority and the subject of a public consultation process. I am further advised that the Waterford Port Company intends to contribute fully to the process.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999 grant aid of some £200,000 was made available to Waterford County Council in 1996 and 1997 towards coast protection schemes at Cunnigar and Tramore costing £266,164.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department received from the county council a consultancy study on further protection works at these locations, and the local authority put forward a proposal for development works based on the study. The council's priority was the strengthening of the promenade wall at Tramore. Under the 2000 coastal protection programme an amount of £465,000 was approved for carrying out this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2000 coastal protection programme also provided funding of £35,000 in respect of the detailed design of protection works at Cunnigar. A decision on the protection to be provided at that location will be informed by the outcome of this design project, and the allocation of funding for the carrying out of those works will be <Col N="876" /> addressed in the context of overall coastal protection programmes and the funding available for such works.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make representations to the Indian authorities regarding the continued use of the system known as bonded labour which amounts to a form of slavery; if he will urge the Indian Government to ensure full implementation of the 1976 Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The incidence of bonded labour in India is a matter of serious concern to the Government and to the international community.</P>
      <P>Bonded labour has long been recognised as a contemporary form of slavery and is forbidden by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, by the 1956 Convention on Practices Similar to Slavery and by the International Labour Organisation, ILO.</P>
      <P>The question of bonded labour in India has been raised at a number of international organisations, in particular the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation. The working group on contemporary forms of slavery, a working group of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of bonded labour. At its session in Geneva in July 2000, the working group devoted priority attention to the question of bonded labour, in particular in India, and adopted a number of recommendations aimed at eliminating this practice.</P>
      <P>The ILO has been addressing bonded labour, and in particular bonded child labour, in India since 1992, through a large series of action and other programmes. The programmes are designed to raise awareness of the problem and to provide education and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to supporting efforts to eliminate this fundamental abuse of human rights and all other forms of slavery. Ireland fully supports the work under way in the UN and ILO to eliminate bonded labour and our concerns have been voiced on this matter in all relevant international fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has provided financial assistance to the UN voluntary trust fund on contemporary forms of slavery, which was established in 1991. This trust fund assists NGOs to participate in the work <Col N="880" /> of the working group on contemporary forms of slavery and to provide assistance to individual victims of contemporary forms of slavery, such as bonded labour.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work for the elimination of this unacceptable practice.</P>

      <P>The RPII report essentially concluded that while the likelihood of a serious accident involving the high level waste tanks is low, there are a number of actions BNFL should undertake to lower the risk further. The actions considered necessary by the RPII include the need for BNFL to complete its analysis of the potential hazard from seismic disturbances and to carry out a further assessment of the consequences of a severe accident. The RPII has urged BNFL to take action on these matters.</P>
      <P>I have requested the RPII to take up the safety improvements recommended in its report with the UK nuclear installations inspectorate. The RPII will report any progress to my Department. I understand that work is in progress in BNFL in undertaking a full review of risks arising from possible seismic disturbances and that the results of this review will be available in due course. I will be monitoring progress on these matters very closely.

      <P>Following a report commissioned by CIE &ndash;&ldquo;Dublin Suburban Rail Strategic Review&rdquo;&ndash; which was concluded earlier this year, a proposal for the upgrading of the northern suburban line to three tracks, from Connolly Station to north of Howth junction, has been incorporated in the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy 2000-2016 &ndash;&ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo;. This strategy was launched by An Taoiseach on 2 October 2000.</P>

      <P>I have held a number of meetings with my counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</P>
      <P>I met with Sir Reg Empey in Dublin on 7 December 1999 where we discussed a wide range of matters of common interest in the energy sector including the upgrading of the North-South electricity interconnector, co-operation and matters in the environment-energy area and possible new gas infrastructures.</P>
      <P>I had a further meeting in Belfast on 8 September this year. The topics covered were a proposed North-South energy study, developments in the natural gas sector including future gas pipeline infrastructure North and South, the issue of a proposed new electricity plant at Coolkeeragh, and electricity interconnection between the two parts of the island.</P>
      <P>I have also met Sir Reg Empey at North-South Ministerial Council meetings in Armagh on 13 December 1999 and in Dublin on 26 September 2000.</P>
      <P>I received a Northern Ireland cross-party delegation from the Enterprise Trade and Investment Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly in Dublin on 23 November 2000 to discuss energy matters.</P>
      <P>On next Tuesday 19 December 2000, I am travelling to Belfast to attend a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council where,<i> inter alia,</i> transport issues are to be discussed.</P>

      <P>The safety of overhead pylons to residents living in close proximity has been the subject of widespread international study and research over many years. The bulk of international scientific opinion does not support the association of health risks with overhead power lines.</P>
      <P>Last month, the UK childhood cancer study which is examining, among other things, health risks associated with residential proximity to overhead power lines, substations and underground cables, reported &ndash; British Journal of Cancer (2000) 83 (11), 1573-1580 &ndash; no evidence that either proximity to electrical installations or the magnetic fields they produce is associated with increased risk of childhood leukaemia or any other cancer. The UK childhood cancer study is the largest and most comprehensive yet undertaken anywhere in the world into the question of health and electricity power lines.</P>
      <P>The siting of pylons and power lines is a day-to-day matter for ESB and not one in which I have a function. However, in the course of regular meetings with the chairman of ESB, he keeps me updated on such matters. My officials also keep in regular contact with ESB officials in order to keep up-to-date with ESB infrastructural developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 to 80, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to Mr. Fischler's statement. The overwhelming weight of current scientific evidence is that the most likely transmission routes for BSE are through the consumption by cattle of infected meat and bone meal or from dam to calf. I am not aware of any new scientific data suggesting grounds for suspecting that environmental contamination of the kind referred to by Mr. Fischler is a factor in the transmission of the disease. However, I am currently seeking clarification in relation to his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that the practice of burying BSE suspect animals is a factor in the spread of BSE in cattle or vCJD in humans. Indeed I understand that research conducted by the UK Environment Agency in 1997, concluded in relation to burial in landfill sites, that the risk of an individual ingesting sufficient infective material from carcasses buried in those sites was negligible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department no longer buries the carcases of BSE infected animals on farms. However, this was the practice up to recently, as there was no satisfactory alternative for the disposal of such animals. In all cases of burial, the rules of regulation 4 of S.I. 257 of 1994 had to be applied. BSE suspect carcasses were buried under licence from my Department and under the direct supervision of a Departmental veterinarian. This officer was required to ensure that the site was located away from water courses; the burial pit was dug to a depth of ten feet; the head was removed at the edge of the pit and any contaminated soil was buried; and the carcase was covered in quicklime, to accelerate decomposition, before being covered in soil.</P>
    <P>Veterinary officers supervising burials are obliged to consult with local authorities in cases where two or more animals are being buried together. Such an obligation does not apply in cases where a single carcase is buried.</P>
    <P>In relation to the location of BSE infected animals, and as I have already indicated on numerous occasions, I do not consider it appropriate to publish the precise locations of burials in each county, which would entail the publication of the name and address of every farmer in whose herd a BSE suspect animal was found.</P>
    <P>My Department is, however, prepared to release to each county council, upon a written request by the county manager, the names and addresses of every farmer in the county in whose herd a BSE suspect animal was found. This information is being released on the understanding that it is treated in a confidential manner as its public release could have various repercussions, both for the person in question and from a BSE control perspective. The general release of this information could discourage farmers from reporting BSE suspect animals thereby undermining the national effort to safeguard public and animal health and to contain and eliminate the disease from the national herd.</P>
    <P>Finally, there have, to date, been 41 outbreaks of BSE in County Meath: 1989, one case; 1990, one case; 1993, one case; 1994, one case; 1995, two cases; 1996, five cases; 1997, seven cases; 1998, four cases; 1999, eight cases and 2000 to date, 11 cases.</P>

      <P>The person named has still not responded to queries from the area aid unit in regard to his 1998 area aid application, but the results of the 2000 area aid inspection have been used in the processing of his 1998 area aid application. The 1998 area aid application for the person named has now been fully processed with no outstanding errors, and the area for payment purposes has been determined at 40.90 hectares.

As for any potential threat to water supplies, this is, of course, a matter for which local authorities have the requisite statutory responsibility. Naturally, my Department will provide Mayo County Council with all available information to enable it to assess any potential risk to water supplies.</P>

      <P>The rural environmental protection scheme was revised in 1999 to include a new supplementary measure A &ndash; in the new scheme recently introduced, this is known as measure A. Under this measure, the EU Commission approved very substantial payments of up to £77 per acre to REPS participants farming eligible commonage lands. The agreement with the EU Commission under which this measure was introduced provides for a global approach to the problem of overgrazing on commonages.</P>
      <P>As with all payments under REPS, the supplementary measure A payments are calculated to compensate farmers for income losses arising from the use of more environmentally friendly farming methods. The substantial SMA payments are based on estimated reductions of 400,000 ewe equivalents on commonage, and 320,000 in natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation where SMA is also payable.</P>
      <P>The actual reduction in sheep numbers will be determined by detailed commonage framework plans which, under the terms of the agreement with the EU Commission, must be drawn up for all commonage land. These plans are being prepared under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The main aim of these plans will be to set sustainable stocking levels, which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation. My Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of detailed framework plans for individual commonages. The interim plan required destocking from November-December 1998 equivalent to 30% of mountain ewes for flock holders not already in the REP scheme who use commonage in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, where the overgrazing issue was deemed to be most serious.</P>
      <P>The preparation of detailed commonage framework plans for every commonage is at an advanced stage, and when these plans are implemented stocking rates will be set which will reflect the environmental needs of each commonage.</P>
      <P>The agreement with the Commission provides for a global approach to the problem of overgrazing on commonages, of which supplementary measure A is one element. It also provides for a complementary national scheme, and I am informed that the EU Commission is currently considering proposals from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for such a scheme. Following the introduction of the national scheme, it will be a condition of eligibility for my Department's compensatory allowance and premia schemes that farmers with commonage land are participating either in the national scheme or in REPS.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the fact that commonage land in any of the six western counties that may have a very low stocking rate, such as two acres to one ewe, is in a position that if a farm of good quality private land comes onto the market the owner of the commonage land can only stock it at the level he currently holds, such as two acres to a ewe, in view of the fact that another person can lease this land and stock it to a maximum number of ewes in a REP scheme; and the reason this is the case.</Quest>

      <P>The preparation of detailed commonage framework plans for every commonage is at an advanced stage, and when these plans are implemented stocking rates will be set which will reflect the environmental needs of each commonage.</P>
      <P>It is important to recall the context in which limits on stock levels had to be set. In certain environmentally sensitive zones in Ireland, a number of farmers have grazed sheep at levels that caused environmental degradation. The problem is particularly acute on commonages.</P>
      <P>Supplementary measures in the initial REPS programme to address overgrazing and degradation of land did not have the desired effect, because take-up was particularly low in commonage areas and where one farmer might make efforts to improve the environment they were often offset by the behaviour of other farmers on the same land. It was necessary to devise a global approach.</P>
      <P>The REP scheme was therefore revised in 1999 to include a new supplementary measure A &ndash; in the new scheme recently introduced, this is known as measure A. This measure includes the requirement that framework plans be drawn up, under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, for all commonage land. The main aim of these plans will be to set sustainable stocking levels, which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation. Under this measure, the EU Commission approved very substantial payments of up to £77 per acre on eligible commonage lands.</P>
      <P>As part of the agreement on the introduction of supplementary measure A, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of detailed framework plans for individual commonages. The interim plan required destocking from November-December 1998 equivalent to 30% of mountain ewes for flock holders not already in the REP scheme who use commonage in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, where the overgrazing issue was deemed to be most serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> When the detailed commonage framework plans are in place, farmers with commonage land must, as a condition of the compensatory allowance and premium schemes, be participating in REPS or in a national scheme to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>In approving the agreement with the EU Commission which forms the basis of the approval of measure A, strict eligibility conditions had to be put in place in order to secure funding for commonage land under the REP scheme. Commonage framework plans must be completed in respect of all commonages setting out the environmentally sustainable level of farming activity permitted. Payment may only be made in respect of owned commonage shares over which farming rights are exercised. No increase in stocking intensity is permitted, and where destocking is required this can not be achieved by a re-distribution of stock on other parts of the holding. Payment is expressly prohibited in respect of leased commonage and dormant shares.</P>
    <P>Where destocking is required the stocking intensity on the entire holding is established and the percentage destocking required is applied only on the commonage area of the holding. Quota rights suppressed as a result of destocking are frozen in the name of the farmer and may be restored as regeneration of the commonage occurs.</P>

      <P>All commonage land is subject to an agreement negotiated with the EU Commission in 1998 following which the rural environmental protection scheme was revised to include a new supplementary measure A &ndash; in the new scheme recently introduced, this is known as measure A. Under this measure, the EU Commission approved very substantial payments of up to £77 per acre for participants in REPS farming eligible commonage lands.

      <P>On foot of the agreement with the Commission, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of detailed framework plans for individual commonages. The interim plan required destocking from November-December 1998 equivalent to 30% of mountain ewes for flock holders not already in the REP scheme who use commonage in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, where the overgrazing issue was deemed to be most serious.

      <P>Planting in areas which are protected or qualify for protection under EU Directives 79/409 and 92/43 on the protection of wild birds and the protection of habitats is possible only with the agreement of Dúchas, the statutory body with responsibility for such areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July and since approved by the European Commission, some £360 million in additional funding has been committed over the period 2001-06. This will increase the total value of the schemes to £1.080 billion over the period concerned. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001. Total expenditure in 2001 will increase by some £60 million to £180 million. Some 81,000 farmers stand to gain under the new arrangements while about 28,000 will incur some losses. The rates of payment approved under the new scheme are £70 per hectare for up to 45 hectares of lowland in the more severely handicapped areas, £60 per hectare for up to 45 hectares of lowland in the less severely handicapped areas and £45 per hectare for up to 60 hectares in areas classified as mountain. Where a farmer has a combination of lowland and mountain he will be paid on up to 45 hectares of lowland first and then on his mountain land up to an overall limit of 60 hectares. In order to minimise any loss under the approved scheme the compensation package which I have negotiated with the European Commission ensures that 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
      <P>I am committed to reviewing the scheme and I have asked my officials to carry out a review in the early part of next year with a view to finding an equitable long-term solution to the problem of reduced payments.</P>

This was primarily in order to make the earliest possible determination of the extent of the hardship endured, viz. numbers and geographical spread of claimants, and to establish the levels of funding required to assist affected householders and others to get back on their feet.</P>
      <P>While applications will be accepted by the Irish Red Cross Society within a reasonable period after the date the scheme cannot be left open indefinitely. The society envisages being in a position by mid January to advise me of the total amount of aid required under the scheme.</P>
      <P>All submissions received will be strictly confidential between the individual applicant and the Irish Red Cross Society. The levels of hardship and the priority with which they shall be relieved and the timetable for payments etc. will be a matter for determination exclusively by the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased with the prompt action by the Irish Red Cross Society in administering the Government's humanitarian aid scheme. The society has commenced its assessment of the early applications and I am happy to state that the first <Col N="901" /> tranche of the £1 million of aid has been forwarded to the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 482 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act (formerly section 19, Finance Act 1982), provides a relief from income tax and corporation tax to the owner-occupier of an &ldquo;approved building&rdquo; in respect of certain expenditure for the repair, maintenance or restoration of an approved building. The building must first be approved by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.</P>
      <P>Once this determination has been made by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, then the Revenue Commissioners must determine that reasonable access is provided to the building for members of the public. The most important condition in this regard is that the premises must be open for at least 60 days per year of which at least 40 must be in the period May to September and that at least ten of these days must be at weekends.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that section 482 requires the owner-occupier of the approved building to give details to Bord Fáilte of the name and address of the buildings and its opening times or, where the approved building is a tourist accommodation facility, the times of the year during which it is so used. The information is given to Bord Fáilte on the understanding that they or another body concerned with the promotion of tourism may publish such information.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the information available to the public, the Revenue Commissioners will shortly supply Bord Fáilte with a list of approved buildings and their opening times for use by the bord in its tourist publications. This list will, I understand, be placed on the Revenue and Bord Fáilte websites in the new year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the particular case in question, it is an established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about the tax affairs of an individual or a company, other then when the Deputy asking the question is seeking information on behalf of the taxpayer. In this instance, it is not clear that the Deputy is asking the question in this context. In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that I must follow the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that the information sought should not be divulged on the grounds of confidentiality.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department formally notified the European Commission of the business elements of the new town renewal scheme on 19 July 2000 around the same time as the specific towns selected for the scheme were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Commission responded on 6 September 2000 with a request for additional information. The matter was discussed in detail at recent meetings with the Commission and a reply is currently being prepared. As things stand at present, it appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the scheme will be approved by the commission. Such a delay is normal where Commission approval is concerned. My Department is continuing to work with the European Commission to ensure the expeditious approval of the business elements of the town renewal scheme.</P>

      <P>With regard to tax incentives in the area mentioned by the Deputy, the situation is as follows.</P>
      <P>Capital allowances of up to 100% are available to farmers in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of buildings and structures to control pollution.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act, 1998, I provided for tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects for a three year period. To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, or £7.5 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that the 2001 Estimates includes a provision of £10 million for waste man<Col N="903" /> agement, including recycling projects. This represents an increase of 22% over 2000.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce additional tax incentives to promote waste management and recycling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with Government guidelines, the staff of ICC Bank will benefit from an employee share ownership plan. The ESOP was negotiated earlier this year between the management and staff of ICC Bank and was recommended to me by the board. It was based on a valuation of £200 million, which was related to an end 1999 price.</P>
      <P>The ESOP consists of two elements a 5% stake in exchange for a transformation agreement, and a further 9.9% through purchase on an optional basis.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the transformation and flexibility agreement are: increasing the hours in the working week; outsourcing of services; open-ended option to reduce staff numbers on a voluntary basis; transfers within the bank; changes in duties; closer linking of performance and reward; no cost increasing claims to be submitted for a period of three years; and continuation of staff flexibility.</P>
      <P>The purchase of 9.9% of the shares in ICC for £19.8 million is funded through increased pension contributions, borrowings, dividends and a 5% profit share arrangement subject to a cumulative limit of £6 million.</P>
      <P>Based on the value of the offer made by Bank of Scotland of £275 million the 5% element which relates to the transformation of ICC would be worth about £40,000 to each staff member. Again based on the offer price, the staff would, having purchased the 9.9% stake for £19.8 million, get a further benefit amounting to an average of £20,000 per employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> It is likely to be at least four years before staff receive any benefit with the final benefit being received at the end of 20 years.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the full allocation of shares, the employee needs to have joined the bank by 1 January 1998. Those with a shorter service with the bank will receive reduced allocations.</P>
    <P>There will be a notional allocation of shares on 1 February 2001 and 1 July 2001.</P>

    <P>The data shows the very significant reduction in personal taxation which has taken place over the period which has greatly reduced the burden of taxation on all income earners and increased the incentive to work. This is especially so over the last four budgets where both the top and standard rates of tax have fallen by four percentage points respectively.</P>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</P>

I have no responsibility for oil price issues or for pump prices, but have answered in relation to tax matters. The following information, supplied by the Revenue Commissioners, sets out that information:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that an individual, aged 65 or over, who is otherwise exempt from tax can complete a simplified claim form in order to claim a refund of DIRT deducted &ndash; form 54D. This form requests details of certain information required in tax returns generally, e.g. other income, marital status, age, <Col N="909" /> etc. and the certificates issued by the relevant financial institutions in respect of the deposits.</P>
      <P>The form is returned to the individual's inspector of taxes. Where the individual has not received any correspondence from the tax office and lives in Dublin, Meath, Kildare or Wicklow the form should be returned to the Inspector of Taxes, Claims Section, 9-15 Upr. O'Connell Street, Dublin 1. If the individual lives elsewhere in the country the completed form should be sent to the local tax office.</P>
      <P>Form 54D is available from all tax offices or by phoning Revenue forms and leaflet services at (01) 878 0000. The form is issued automatically at the beginning of the tax year to individuals who qualified for a DIRT refund in the previous year.</P>
      <P>I have forwarded a copy of the form to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Legal fees paid in connection with the break-up of a marriage are not tax deductible.</P>
      <P>If maintenance payments are made under a maintenance arrangement &ndash; see below &ndash; the spouse paying maintenance can claim a deduction for those payments made in the year of assessment for the benefit of the other spouse. The spouse to whom the maintenance is paid is taxable under case IV, Schedule D, in respect of such maintenance payments received. Where an individual can claim a tax deduction for the maintenance payments, he or she is not entitled to claim the married persons tax allowance.</P>
      <P>A tax deduction cannot be claimed in respect of maintenance payments made for the benefit of a child.</P>
      <P>Where maintenance payments are not made under a maintenance arrangement, the person making the maintenance payments cannot claim a tax deduction for those payments and the recipient is not taxable on them. In such circumstances the married person's allowance may be claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally I should explain that a maintenance arrangement means an order of a court, rule of court, deed of separation, trust, covenant, agreement, arrangement of any other act giving rise to a legally enforceable obligation and made or done in consideration or in consequence of the dissolution or annulment of a marriage, or such separation of the parties to the marriage as is referred to in section 1015(2) and a maintenance arrangement relates to the marriage in consideration or in consequence of the dissolution or annulment of which, or of the Spartan of the par<Col N="910" /> ties to which the maintenance arrangement was made or arises &ndash; section 1025(1) Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>

It was envisaged that the construction of the station would be carried out as a joint development to include a new library, civil offices and a community centre.</P>
      <P>As a result of An Bord Pleanála's decision to uphold the appeal against the demolition of Newtown House, a revised site was offered by Kildare County Council and was considered unsuitable for the construction of a new Garda station.</P>

      <P>Most public sector pension schemes provide that the death gratuity is payable to the estate of the deceased person, while the spouse's pension, if any, is payable to the legal spouse. The question of nominating a beneficiary to receive the death benefit was one of a wide range of issues examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. I have recently received the Commission's final report and I am making arrangements for its publication. The Government intends to make formal decisions on the commission's recommendations &ndash; including any relating to death benefits &ndash; once it has had an opportunity to consider the report in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any health problems experienced by Irish consumers due to imported genetically modified foods. If the Deputy wishes to provide me with such information I will be happy to pursue the matter further.</P>
      <P>The importation and labelling of GM foods in Ireland is governed by the following EU Regulations: &ndash; Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients; Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 49/2000; Regulation (EC) No. 50/2000 on the labelling of foodstuffs and food ingredients containing additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labelling requirements as prescribed in these regulations ensure that the final consumer <Col N="948" /> is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.</P>
    <P>The controls which exist in the regulations outlined above provide protection to consumers and I am keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has embarked on a nationwide GM food surveillance campaign to ascertain compliance levels with these regulations, initially targeting food products which possibly contain illegal GM ingredients, and improperly labelled authorised GM food. I look forward to receiving the results of this survey which I understand will be available early in 2001.</P>

      <P>Homelessness is a serious social issue and the dynamics of homelessness involve a complex interrelationship of social and economic factors. Recognising this, the Government published a strategy in May of this year aimed at tackling homelessness. This strategy, entitled Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, aims to tackle all aspects of homelessness in an integrated manner.</P>
      <P>The strategy recognises that local authorities and voluntary bodies use bed and breakfast accommodation when hostel or other accommodation is not available. Bed and breakfast accommodation is intended to be used only as an emergency or short-term accommodation. However, in the absence of hostel or other long-term accommodation, the local authorities and the Eastern Regional Health Authority may have to use more of this type of accommodation and to keep people there for longer periods. It is acknowledged that bed and breakfast accommodation is unsuitable for long-term accommodation, particularly by families.</P>
      <P>The strategy proposes that all local authorities and health boards will draw up a three year action plan for the delivery of services to homeless persons and the action plan for Dublin will prioritise the elimination of the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families other than in emergencies and for only short-term use. Additional funding from the Department of Environment and Local Government and my own Department is being made available to ensure implementation of agreed action plans.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that a director for homeless services for Dublin has recently been selected and is due to take up appointment as soon as possible. This appointment will facilitate the establishment of the Dublin homeless services agency in the near future. This agency will manage and co-ordinate the delivery of all services by both the statutory and voluntary agencies to the homeless in Dublin. It will have staffing from Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and other agencies.</P>
      <P>I have also referred the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that the issues raised be further examined and a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if mercury is an ingredient in certain vaccines; if so, the vaccine in which this is so; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that patients can have a reaction to this ingredient; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that in the US persons are informed of the possible side effects before being offered vacci nation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Irish Medicines Board, which is the expert authority in Ireland regarding medicinal products, about this matter. I understand that, while mercury itself is not an ingredient in any vaccines authorised by the board, an organomercuric compound, Thiomersal, is used as an anti-microbial preservative in some vaccines for human use. In addition to its anti-microbial capacity it may perform other functions affecting antigenicity and stability. Manufacturers and authorities generally have accepted the use of anti-microbial compounds because the pharmacopeial methods recommended for the preparation of sterile products by physical means such as heat and-or filtration cannot in general be applied to the active ingredients of vaccines.</P>
      <P>The use of Thiomersal in vaccines has been considered on a number of occasions by the scientific committees of the European Medicines Agency in which the Irish Medicines Board participates. In July 1999 they recommended that all medicinal products containing Thiomersal be required to state in the patient information leaflet that: &ldquo;this medicinal product contains Thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you-your child may experience an allergic reaction&rdquo;. &ldquo;Tell your doctor if you-your child has any known allergies&rdquo;. Companies were required by the Irish Medicines Board to implement this statement by the end of June 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the biotechnology working party of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products has recently (16 November 2000 CPMP-BWP-2517-00) issued a consultation document entitled Points to Consider on the Reduction, Elimination or Substitution of Thiomersal in Vaccines. This document has been released for consultation with a deadline for comments of February 2001 and encourages authorisation holders to reduce and-or eliminate or substitute Thiomersal. It is recognised that this is a complex task which may require additional clinical studies before it can be implemented.</P>

      <P>Where the patient is in an at-risk group and is not a medical card holder, there should be no charge for the vaccine itself, as this is available free of charge to general practitioners from health board supplies.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>I have made funding available to the Health Service Employers Agency to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad. Nurses from the Philippines and certain other non-EU countries are required to undertake such placements prior to registration with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of nurses from abroad is helping to ease staffing difficulties across a range of health care settings. However, some problems have arisen in relation to the availability of supervised clinical placements. I am determined that nurses requiring such placements will be provided with them. The Health Service Employers' Agency co-ordinator will have a nationwide remit in ensuring the availability of sufficient clinical placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met representatives of An Bord Altranais last <Col N="953" /> week to discuss the need for greater flexibility in relation to the clinical sites where nurses from abroad may undertake their supervised placements. I am confident that the board will respond positively to my proposals.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to provide funding to teaching hospitals involved in the provision of supervised clinical placements in respect of the salary of a clinical co-ordinator for the duration of such placements. Since this is the biggest single cost element, the availability of funding to cover it will greatly reduce the overall cost to agencies, such as nursing homes, which are recruiting nurses from non EU countries. However, other costs associated with these placements, including vaccinations and meals, are a matter for negotiation between the individual hospital and prospective employer concerned. I am not in a position to provide funding for such matters.</P>

      <P>It is vital that the techniques used in screening for cancer are proved to be medically effective and accurate before screening programmes, covering large segments of the population, are introduced. Reliable screening techniques for breast cancer and cervical cancer are now well established internationally.</P>
      <P>I will keep the question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer under review, having regard to the most up to date advice on the medical effectiveness of the available screening techniques. The National Cancer Forum, which advises me on all aspects of cancer services, will continue to have an important role in this regard and I will be asking the forum to ensure that all relevant research is taken into account in arriving at a conclusion on the introduction of new screening programmes and techniques.</P>

      <P>While a considerable volume of research has been carried out over the years in this area it has not substantiated a definite link between electromagnetic fields and cancer. I am advised that the research referred to by the Deputy is not conclusive on this matter and recommends that further research be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major research project, the international electromagnetic fields project, is being co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. The EMF project was established by the WHO in 1996 and is due to complete its work in 2001. The <Col N="956" /> WHO, in collaboration with international agencies and organisations, is pooling resources and knowledge concerning effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields and is trying to identify gaps in knowledge in this area. This includes recommending better focused research programmes that allow better health risk assessments to be made and updating critical reviews of scientific literature. The WHO is working towards an international consensus and resolution on the health concerns in this area. The studies referred to by the Deputy will be incorporated into the existing body of scientific literature and assessed by the broad scientific community.</P>
    <P>Medical officers in my Department keep informed of any significant developments in this area in regard to human health concerns. Should evidence emerge of any significant risk to public health, I would seek to have remedial measures put in place by the appropriate Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>The new taxi regime which I have recently announced already includes a number of measures designed to improve the quality of taxi services. Annual instead of two yearly testing of vehicles has been introduced and this will soon come fully under the auspices of the national car test. By end 2001, all taxis will have to be fitted with taximeters capable of issuing automatic receipts. In addition, it is intended by end 2003 to begin the process of making all taxis wheelchair accessible.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a rapid improvement of taxi services under the new arrangements. In addition, I intend to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term.</P>
      <P>Licensing of drivers of small public service vehicles continues to be the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and this process includes checks as to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence to drive a small public service vehicle as well as a knowledge test of the taximeter area in question.</P>

Having regard to this position, my Department has, in the context of its permitting of certain buses or bus types, imposed requirements for the safe location of controls for public address apparatus and for self supporting microphones for drivers' use.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in order to assist local authority tenants purchase their <Col N="959" /> homes a discount of 3% of the value of the house is allowed for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum of 30%. In addition to this, a further discount of £3,000, equivalent to the new house grant for first time purchasers, is provided. Thus, a local authority house with a market value of £100,000, would be available for purchase at £67,000 by a tenant of ten or more years' standing. By any account, this is a generous discount.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of the sale of local authority houses to tenants are used to part fund the local authority housing programme. I consider that the terms of the present scheme strike a reasonable balance between the aspirations of existing tenants to own their own homes and the needs of those on the local authority waiting lists. While I have no proposals, at present, to amend the terms of the current scheme I will continue to keep them under review and the Deputy's suggestions will be borne in mind in this context.</P>

Recruitment of these additional staff is ongoing. As at end November 2000, An Bord Pleanála had vacancies for 23.5 administrative positions and for ten professional planner positions.</P>
      <P>The percentage of appeals not decided by the board within the four month statutory objective as set down in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, was 37% and 53%, in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The latest statistics, year to end October, 2000, show that 52% of cases were not decided within four months. However, the board has been giving priority to housing developments in excess of 30 units and the percentage of such cases not decided within four months was 38% in the year to end October. Details of the measures being pursued by my Department and the board to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously are set out in my reply to a parliamentary question on 13 December 2000.</P>

    <P>Output from the voluntary housing sector had been in decline since 1995. On my appointment as Minister in 1997 I resolved to reverse this trend. I have increased the unit cost limits for assistance under the voluntary housing schemes in each of the last three years and these will continue to be reviewed. These improved terms are clearly having a positive effect on activity in the sector. Returns received from local authorities for the first nine months of this year show a substantial increase in the number of completions achieved by the sector for the year so far and also a marked increase in the numbers under construction and at planning stage compared to the start of the year. Definitive outturn figures for this year are not yet available, however, I expect that some 1,000 additional units will be provided.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 20, 29 and 70 of 12 December 2000, I gave approval at the end of October to a more detailed analysis by local authorities of 11 of the 25 sites put forward by them as potential strategic development zones for residential development under Part IX of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Submissions have been received in relation to each of the sites and an assessment of these submissions is currently being finalised by my Department. As part of the analysis, and where the matter had not previously been addressed, the local authorities concerned were asked to assess what structures needed to be put in place to deliver necessary infrastructure to these sites in the event of their designation as strategic development zones. In this context, the local authorities were asked to have regard to the preferred approach set out in Action on Housing regarding the establishment of project offices to drive infrastructure development. This particular issue is being assessed as part of the overall evaluation by my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department also wrote separately to key local authorities in August asking them to examine the operation and resourcing of existing project offices for water and sewerage schemes necessary for new housing development. Proposals have been received by a number of authorities including south Dublin, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Meath and Wicklow county councils for the expansion of existing offices or the creation of new offices. The arrangements required to facilitate this are being considered by my Department in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</P>

The main focus of the team is currently on the implementation of the various Government measures set out in Action on Housing and with a particular emphasis on identifying and addressing constraints or bottlenecks to securing maximum housing output in the short and medium term. The team is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department with representation by senior officials of my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Public Enterprise. The team has met on three occasions to date and presented its first progress report to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure on 26 October.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 20, 29 and 70 of 12 December 2000, planning authorities are required to prepare their housing strategies under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, by 1 August next. They have a maximum of a further three months thereafter to complete the procedures to vary the development plan to incorporate the strategy. I have urged them to complete this process ahead of this so that they can operate the social and affordable housing provisions in planning permissions as soon as possible. Based on available information, it appears that, in general, county councils and county boroughs are at the early stages in the preparation of their strategies. The four Dublin planning authorities, however, have been working over the last few months on the preparation of their strategies and it is expected that the draft strategies will be submitted to the respective councils early next year for consideration. I will be asking county and city managers to report to my Department by the end of January next setting out the position in relation to the preparation of the housing strategy for their area at that time, and specifically when it is proposed to complete the draft strategy and the procedures to vary the development plan to incorporate the strategy. When that information has been collated I will be able to estimate when the first planning permissions containing social and affordable housing conditions will be granted.</P>

      <P>The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, provided <Col N="968" /> that disposals of land with planning permission for residential development would be subject to a reduced rate of capital gains tax of 20% up until 5 April 2002 with a new 60% rate to apply for disposals from 6 April 2002 onwards in order to incentivise the early release of land suitable for housing development. This provision was subsequently amended in the Finance Act, 1999, to provide that all land zoned for residential development would be liable to a 20% capital gains tax rate when disposed of before 5 April 2002. The 1999 Act also provided for a general reduction in capital gains tax rates from 40% to 20%.</P>
      <P>Disaggregated information on land transactions for residential development since the reduced rate of capital gains tax came into effect in 1998 is not available in my Department. There are, however, a range of indirect indicators such as the increase in house completions, the number of planning permissions granted, HomeBond registrations, and the availability of serviced land which indicate that substantial tracts of serviced residential land are being brought into development.</P>

      <P>The Government's integrated strategy on homelessness clarified the respective roles of the local authorities and health boards in providing services for homeless persons. In essence, local authorities have responsibility for providing accommodation for homeless persons and health boards are responsible for their care and welfare needs.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's strategy, local authorities, working together with health boards and voluntary bodies, are currently drawing up local action plans to meet the needs of homeless persons in their areas. These plans will identify what additional services, including accommodation and settlement and outreach programmes will be provided in each area over the next three years. In the meantime I continue to urge local authorities to provide directly or acquire additional premises for use as accommodation for homeless persons.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Graiguenamanagh and Kilmacow schemes were originally proposed for inclusion in the water services investment programme by Kilkenny County Council in 1991. The Thomastown proposal dates back to 1994. The proposals remained unapproved until I authorised their inclusion in the programme for the first time, in 1998 in the case of Thomastown, and in 1999 in the cases of Graiguenamanagh and Kilmacow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999 the council's preliminary report for the Thomastown scheme, estimated to cost £1.6 million, was approved by my Department and the council was authorised to engage consultants to prepare contract documents. In October 1999 my Department issued a new policy circular (L12/99) to all local authorities requesting them to consider grouping projects on a catchment basis for procurement as single design-build-operate contracts in order to bring greater focus to water services investment in reducing the volume of sewage and phosphates entering inland waters from municipal discharges. In January 2000, the council sought the Department's agreement to the Thomastown scheme proceeding under the traditional procurement method in order to avoid delay in meeting pressing development requirements. The Department's agreement to this course was conveyed to <Col N="973" /> the council on 21 February 2000, subject to consideration being given in due course to the operation of the completed plant being grouped with other suitable projects. In the meantime, a brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare the contract document's had been submitted by the council and this was approved by the Department in March. The submission of the contract documents by the council for approval is now awaited. Once the contract documents have been cleared the council will be free to invite tenders for the work.</P>
    <P>Following the inclusion of the Kilmacow scheme in the 1999 investment programme, at an estimated cost of £1 million, a revised preliminary report for the scheme was approved in principle in July 1999, subject to the submission of certain additional information to the Department. A reply was received from the council in July 2000, following which they were asked to address a number of issues, including the feasibility of the scheme being advanced as a design-build or design-build-operate scheme in accordance with established departmental procurement policy.</P>
    <P>In November 2000, the council requested my Department's agreement to the scheme proceeding under the traditional procurement procedure. However, the council has made no substantial case in favour of that approach and the Department's response of 24 November, to which a reply is awaited, advised it that the report requested in July would have to be submitted before a decision could be made in this respect. Apart from these procedural issues, I understand that the council has yet to finalise acquisition of the site for the treatment works.</P>
    <P>Because the contract documents for the Graiguenamangh scheme, estimated to cost £1.6 million, had been approved at an earlier stage, the Department has raised no objection to this scheme proceeding along the traditional procurement route. The council's tender report and recommendation for the civil works contract was received in the Department in July this year. The Department subsequently sought clarification from the council on some aspects of the tenders and an amended report was received on 20 November. This is currently being examined in the Department and will be dealt with expeditiously. Work on the civil and mechanical and electrical elements of the project, which are the subject of separate contracts, will need to be co-ordinated. A tender recommendation for the mechanical and electrical contract has yet to be submitted by the council. When both tenders have been approved the council will be in a position to start work on the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that these schemes should proceed without delay so that the development needs of the areas concerned are provided for as quickly as possible. Funding has been set aside for them in the water services investment programme and once the outstanding issues have been dealt with the council will be encouraged by my Department <Col N="974" /> to progress the schemes to construction with all possible urgency.</P>

      <P>I understand from Sligo Corporation that land in their ownership at Rathquarter was purchased approximately 20 years ago. In the period 1994-2000 two separate schemes of 20 houses were completed and a 26 house scheme is currently under construction. The total land cost attributed to these three schemes amounts to £127,000 and has been funded as part of the overall capital cost of the projects.</P>

      <P>In general provisional licence holders are required to be accompanied and supervised by a person qualified to drive the vehicle concerned. However, in deference to practical considerations, successive Governments since 1979 have permitted some concessions in relation to this general rule. At present, driving of motor cycles and tractors-work vehicles is exempted from it. In addition, a learner driver who holds a second provisional licence in respect of category B vehicles &ndash; cars &ndash; is exempt from being accompanied during the two year term of that provisional licence.</P>
      <P>This latter arrangement reflects a presumption that, in general, persons on a second provisional licence should have sufficient previous driving experience to be allowed to drive unaccompanied for the period of the second licence. The limitation of the exemption to this period is intended as an incentive to pass the driving test during it.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that when applying for a provisional licence a person must, inter alia, make a declaration that he or she has a satisfactory knowledge of the rules of the road. It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, for a person to furnish particulars in relation to an application for a provisional licence which to his or her knowledge is false or misleading, </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> A driver theory test will be introduced in mid 2001 as an additional requirement for novice drivers and will cover in greater depth than the existing practical driving test such areas as knowledge of the rules of the road, risk perception, hazard awareness and good driving behaviour.</P>

      <P>In calculating means for the purposes of farm assist, account is taken of the gross yearly income which the farmer and his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive from farming or any other self-employment, less any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on the business. Where the farmer has dependent children, £200.00 per annum is disregarded in respect of each of the first two qualified children and £300.00 each per annum for subsequent children. Some 70% of the remaining net income is then assessed.</P>
      <P>The assessment is designed to form a basis on which entitlement to farm assist can be determined. This means that the assessment of the expected annual income is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity and market trends. Where a farmer disagrees with a means assessment, he or she may appeal the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. In addition, where a farmer feels that his or her circumstances have changed since the most recent assessment, he or she may request a means review.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. Regulations prescribe the circumstances which determine whether, a child aged 16 years or over, may be regarded as receiving full-time education, for child benefit purposes.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, a child must be attending, on a full-time basis, a course of full-time instruction by day at an institute of education in order to be regarded as receiving full-time education. The regulations also stipulate that certain courses of training or instruction, including those which form part of an employment or work experience programme, may not be regarded as a course of full-time instruction at an institution of education. In the latter circumstances, child benefit would not be payable as the child would not be regarded as receiving full-time education as prescribed in the regulations.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is proposing that the existing regulations should be amended in order that child benefit would be payable in a situation where work experience was a compulsory pre-entry requirement to a third level course. The introduction of such a measure could raise equity issues in relation to other people, in the same age group, who undertake work experience in order to enhance their prospects of gaining a place on a course or obtaining employment. In addition, the extension of child benefit to this category would have cost implications and consequently, would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to Government priorities and the available resources.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant <Col N="977" /> aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. One of the features of the scheme is that voluntary groups apply to the Department on behalf of individuals.</P>
      <P>The individual referred to in the Deputy's question sought assistance under the 2000 scheme of community support for older people through a voluntary group. I can confirm that the application submitted by this group on behalf of some 409 individuals, has been approved and arrangements have been made to issue payment. The allocation represents 90% of the total amount sought and is the maximum funding payable under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that no such argument may be made legitimately. The requirements of the Habitats Directive are quite straightforward with no room for interpretation. The main requirements of the directive may be summed up as follows: member states to provide a list of special areas of conservation to the EU Commission; and member states to maintain or improve the favourable conservation status of these sites.</P>
      <P>To this end Dúchas has provided the EU Commission with a list of 362 candidate SACs. The favourable conservation status of these sites on farmland will be maintained through the implementation of a rural environment protection scheme plan or the implementation of a plan prepared by my Department. Rather than imposing conditions on farmers in these sites my Department has successfully agreed farming practices in respect of the farming conditions to be applied in the Burren, on blanket bogs, heaths, upland grasslands, sand dunes, machair. Conditions in respect of other habitat types are ongoing.</P>

      <P>The National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks is open to the public from Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. The annual visitor numbers for this site totals approximately 150,000, which taking seasonal variations into account, shows an average attendance of 3,000 visitors per week.</P>
      <P>Collins Barracks represents one strand of the national museum's operations. As part of a normal consultative process, the museum authorities advise my Department of its plans and objectives in line with its strategic development plan. It accordingly seeks the necessary resources to meet these needs on a regular planned basis.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the certification of film projects availing of tax relief on investment under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Since its inception in 1994, over 200 projects have been certified, involving some £400 million of section 481 investment and an Irish spend of over £460 million. Earlier this year, the Government extended the section 481 scheme for an unprecedented span of five years, to 2005. In the period 1994-99, the Irish Film Board has provided development loans in excess of £2.5 million and production loans of approximately £20 million. Screen Training Ireland training initiatives have been jointly funded from Exchequer funding &ndash; 25% &ndash; and the European Social Funding &ndash; 75%. Again, in the period 1994-99, the total funding to Screen Training Ireland was £3.8 million. This included a contribution of almost £1 million from FÁS. Since taking office, I have more than doubled the provision for the Irish Film Board, which will be £8.75 million for the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Under its strategic plan for the Irish film industry, the Government has decided to assign the audiovisual industry a central place in Ireland's industrial policy through the co-ordinated commitment of the industrial agencies of the State, together with the Irish Film Board, to the development of the industry's full potential and in particular, to fostering strong indigenous companies in this sector.</P>
      <P>Underpinned by the five-year extension of the section 481 tax scheme for investment in film, the Government, under the strategic plan devised for the Irish film industry, has approved the strengthening and enhancement of the Irish Film Board to address the strategic goals identified in the report of the Film Industry strategic review group. I am assigning substantially increased capital and staff resources, to the board for its new functions and later today the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which will increase the capital ceiling for the board from £30 million to £80 million is expected to complete Report and Final Stages in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The EU habitats directive lists habitats and species for which SACs must be designated. Outside the boundaries of some SACs there are lands which, while not hosting such species or habitats, may need to be subject to restrictions of use in order to maintain the <Col N="983" /> favourable conservation status of the relevant species or habitats within the actual sites. These restrictions are likely to affect activities such as the spraying of fertiliser and pesticides.

      <P>Proposed SACs were widely advertised in the regional newspapers and on local radio. In addition maps of the sites are available for public inspection through Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in county council planning offices, Teagasc county offices and farm development service offices. My Department has directly notified over 13,000 individual landowners and will notify any additional landowners that come to notice. My Department <Col N="984" /> operates a freephone line to assist landowners in respect of SAC proposals. I wish to assure the Deputy that all landowners who come to notice will be provided with an opportunity to object, on scientific grounds, to the inclusion of their land in these sites.</P>
      <P>Landowners were identified through various methods. Initially a contract team was engaged to search Land Registry records. Rates records were also examined. However, these methods were found to be too time consuming and inaccurate at the time. Accordingly, Dúchas arranged for its local officials to identify landowners. I do not consider that the notification procedures have been inadequate.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether the Irish regulations implemented through the habitats directive go far beyond what is necessitated by the directive by choosing and imposing restrictions on non-priority sites in a manner which lacks transparency; and if this flawed interpretation of the habitats directive has been used as the basis for all subsequent discussions including compensatory mechanisms.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish regulations transposing the EU habitats directive provide the necessary powers to designate and protect special areas of conservation, and to compensate landowners for any losses arising from the imposition of restrictions necessary to ensure the maintenance of the favourable conservation status of these sites. The directive requires all activities, plans and developments impacting significantly on SACs to be assessed in the light of their likely effect on the relevant conservation interest. If in spite of a negative assessment of the implications for a site, and in the absence of alternative solutions, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, the only considerations which may be raised, in the case of priority habitat sites, are those relating to human health or public safety, to beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment or, further to an opinion from the Commission to other imperative reasons of overriding public interest. In the case of non-priority habitat imperative reasons of overriding public interest may also include those of a social or economic nature. These facts provide the basis for discussions between my officials and interested parties. I am satisfied that the Regulations correctly give effect to these provisions in Irish law and that they have been implemented in a transparent manner.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to compensation is that I have agreed to compensate landowners, in full, for actual losses arising from the imposition of restrictions. If landowners are unhappy with any compensation awards offered, they may refer the matter to independent arbitration.</P>

      <P>My Department has proposed over 250,000 ha of raised and blanket bog for SAC designation. In general this is relatively intact peatland with only marginal cutaway areas included. Bogs, which are entirely cutaway, do not meet the criteria for designation.</P>
      <P>Bórd na Móna has sold or transferred bogs suitable for NHA-SAC or SPA designation to Dúchas. The bogs which it has retained are worked or degraded ecologically and do not meet the criteria for designation.</P>
      <P>The afforestation of peatlands alters the ecology of the land afforested and consequently it no longer merits designation for conservation purposes. In mapping the boundaries of proposed NHAs and SACs, all substantial areas of existing conifer plantations were excluded, whether owned by Coillte or private landowners.</P>

Article 2 of the habitats directive clearly states the aims of the directive as follows: &ldquo;the aim of this directive shall be to contribute towards ensuring bio-diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of the member states to which the Treaty applies; measures taken pursuant to this directive shall be designed to maintain or restore, at favourable conservation status, natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of Community interest; measures taken pursuant to this Directive shall take account of economic, social and cultural requirements and regional characteristics&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Activities or developments that are incompatible with the maintenance of the favourable conservation status of land included in SACs and SPAs are prohibited, other than in exceptional circumstances of overriding public interest.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 213, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In excess of 1,300 monuments and sites in County Kildare are protected under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, histori<Col N="987" /> cal, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. The number of structures that are so protected in County Kildare is a matter for the planning authorities there.</P>
    <P>In addition to Castletown House, there are 15 national monuments in State care in County Kildare to which the public has access. There are a number of other sites in both public and private ownership that are open to the public. The Deputy will appreciate that my Department would not have access to the information that she is seeking in regard to properties not in the care of my Department.</P>

      <P>Good progress is being made on the restoration of Maynooth Castle. The priority for 2001 is to have work on the restoration of the ground and first floors completed.</P>
      <P>Once the castle is open to the public in the second half of 2001 my Department will then be in a position to assess the needs of the site in terms of visitor numbers and facilities and make a determination as to the level, if any, of additional works require to ensure its successful operation. At that stage a decision will be made as to a budget allocation for Phase 2.</P>
      <P>As you are aware the estimated cost of the project is £1.3 million and the expenditure on this project in 2000 is likely to be in the region of £623,000 and the balance will be incurred in 2001.</P>

      <P>The Record of Monuments and Places &ndash; RMP &ndash; which was fully established in 1998 gave legal protection to some 120,000 sites nationwide. The RMP for each county consists of a set of Ordnance Survey constraint maps, together with an accompanying index.

    <P>My Department's published policy states that preservation of archaeological sites <i>in situ</i> is the preferred option. Generally it is only in situations where sites are being unavoidably impacted upon such as in road construction, that preservation by record, i.e. archaeological excavation is undertaken.</P>

      <P>Within the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, I have attended one meeting with my Northern colleague, Minister Michael McGimpsey in the Waterways sectoral format. This meeting dealt with issues relating to the establishment of Waterways Ireland. Further sectoral meeting arranged for Scarriff, County Clare, in October last was postponed but arrangements are being made to reschedule that meeting in Scarriff for January 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition, I attended two plenary meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, one in Armagh and the other in Dublin, at which Minister McGimpsey was also present. These meetings were concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, with the setting up of the North-South bodies.</P>
      <P>I have also met Minister McGimpsey on a number of occasions outside the ambit of the North-South Ministerial Council, as follows: Monday, 17 January 2000 Opening of Clothing Exhibition, Collins Barracks, &ldquo;The way we wore&rdquo;; Thursday, 14 September 2000 Opening of &ldquo;Flight of the Earls Exhibition&rdquo;, Draperstown, Derry; Wednesday, 11 October 2000 Opening of Texaco Children's Art Exhibition, Ulster Museum, Belfast; Friday, 17 November 2000 Dinner of joint meeting of Northern Ireland Arts Council and An Chomhairle Ealaíon in Dublin Castle; Sunday, 3 December 2000 Presentation of Irish Film and Television Awards in The Waterfront, Belfast.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are approximately 1,050 neighbourhood watch schemes in the Dublin metropolitan region. Due to the very high number of schemes it would not be practicable to provide a complete list in this reply. I will, however, forward these details to the Deputy in due course.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that a total of 267 gardaí are appointed as liaison gardaí to neighbourhood watch schemes in the Dublin metropolitan region and that while members of community policing units may from time to time perform other duties, in the main they are employed in a community policing and crime prevention capacity.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that there is now a need for some form of overarching structure to co-ordinate the entire neighbourhood watch operation on a national basis, and my Department has been considering how best to achieve this. This has necessitated careful consideration of the recommendations contained within the evaluation of neighbourhood watch and community alert which was commissioned by my Department.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that I have already obtained Government approval to provide additional posts within the Garda Síochána at Inspector level and I am pleased to note that the Commissioner will assign one of these posts to work with the new structure.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to proceed with the establishment of a new structure to support and develop neighbourhood watch early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, as amended, prescribe the criteria for recruitment of trainees to the Force. In general, the upper age limit for recruitment of trainees to the Garda Síochána is 26 years. Subject to certain limits, deductions in age can be granted in respect of service in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, exempts the Garda Síochána from the provisions of the Act relating to discrimination on grounds of age as the essential functions of the force require that it comprise a reasonable proportion of young people. Other factors to be borne in mind in considering the upper age limit for recruitment are the cost of Garda training and the voluntary retirement arrangements in the force.</P>
      <P>No difficulty has been experienced in obtaining sufficient applicants of an appropriate standard to meet recruiting requirements. In this regard, the strength of the force is due to reach 12,000, the highest level in the history of the State, by the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my previous reply on this matter, the person in question was recently granted permission to remain on the basis of his parentage of Irish born children. A number of standard conditions are attached to this permission and these were set out in the letter granting him residency. The person in question should now register with his local Garda registration office in order to be issued with a Garda registration book and to have the necessary endorsement placed in his passport.</P>

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services which is responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers has entered into an agreement with the proprietor of Mosney holiday centre for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services for asylum seekers on part of the holiday centre.</P>
      <P>The making available of any of the balance of the facilities at Mosney holiday centre to ESB community games is a matter in the first instance for the proprietor of the centre. At no stage did I or the Directorate for Asylum Support Services indicate that the centre would not be available to the community games organisation. In fact, I have indicated to the officials of the community games organisation that I would support and facilitate them as much as possible in the holding of the games at the centre.</P>
      <P>I should also add for the information of the Deputy that given the overall severe shortage of accommodation, the acquisition of facilities to accommodate asylum seekers, who continue to arrive here at a rate of approximately 1,000 per month presents a great challenge to the directorate. In those circumstances, it would have been most unwise of it to spurn the offer of accommodation at the centre which to all intents and purposes was ready for immediate occupation. If, of course, the Deputy has any alternative suggestions as to how asylum seekers might be accommodated, I would be glad to hear them.</P>

The reasons for this decision were outlined in detail to the council last month.

      <P>I met my ministerial counterpart in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Sir Reg Empey MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on four occasions to discuss the establishment of the North-South tourism company, envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement. Our first meeting took place at the North-South Ministerial Council &ndash; NSMC &ndash; inaugural plenary meeting, in Armagh, on 13 December 1999. We had two further meetings, on 30 June and 12 September 2000, for informal exchanges of views on the company's establishment.</P>
      <P>Our last meeting was at the inaugural meeting of the NSMC in tourism sectoral format in Belfast, on 27 October 2000. At the meeting, a number of important decisions were taken in relation to the establishment of the all-island tourism marketing company, leading to the formal incorporation of the company &ndash; Tourism Ireland Limited &ndash; under Irish company law on Monday, 11 December 2000.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The assessment of means under the third level maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income. Certain social welfare and health board payments are not taken into account, in the calculation of reckonable income. When assessing income from self-employment-farming, the amount assessed is the adjusted profit-loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit, in computing reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>The student in question is currently pursuing the second year of a bachelor of arts degree course at UCD. My Department understands from Galway County Council, the body charged with the administration of the grants scheme in this case, that she did receive a maintenance grant, at the non-adjacent rate, in respect of her attendance on the first year of the course, in the academic year 1999-2000. However, her eligibility for grant assistance in respect of the current academic year was re-assessed by Galway County Council, under the terms of the scheme. It was established that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limits set down in the 2000 scheme, in order to qualify for a grant. Accordingly, she is not eligible for a maintenance grant in respect of the current academic year.</P>
      <P>However, the student in question did qualify for a fees-only grant and, in this regard, she will benefit from a grant of £292 in respect of the charge for student services, registration and examinations.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, accordingly, it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases such as this.</P>

      <P>Section 26 of the Act states that where a parents' association in a school is affiliated to a national association of parents, the rules made by the association to govern its meetings and the business and conduct of its affairs will be in accordance with guidelines issued by the national association of parents, with the concurrence of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In February 1999, the Government took a decision to establish a national educational psychological service agency, NEPS. Under the terms of that decision, the agency has an overall target number of 200 psychologists and this target is to be achieved as soon as possible, beginning in the school year 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>In the last few months, I have appointed 38 new psychologists to NEPS and a further ten are in process of being recruited. I also expect to be in a position to announce a further expansion of the service in the near future. The current situation is that NEPS provides a psychological service to all post-primary schools and approximately 725 primary schools. The expansion of NEPS is now well under way, with, at present, 75 psychologists serving with the agency. As soon as the newly appointed psychologists have completed their induction training, they will be deployed in schools.</P>
      <P>The NEPS psychologists are being deployed in ten regions corresponding to the health board regions. It is envisaged that, by the end of its development period, the NEPS psychologists will be providing an educational psychological service to every school in the country.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by some schools in gaining access to psychological assessments, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. Two initiatives are aimed at meeting this need.</P>
      <P>Firstly, a working group, including representatives of NEPS and of the health boards, has been set up by the management committee of NEPS. It is to consider joint structures and procedures that may ensure that children in urgent need of psychological assessment are not left without psychological support during the expansion phase of NEPS. It is expected that this group will give this task a high priority.</P>
      <P>NEPS is also undertaking a pilot project with the aim of developing a strategy for responding to requests from schools not yet served by NEPS for urgent psychological assessments. This exercise will be completed early in the new year. If the results are satisfactory, consideration will be given to extending the arrangements to other areas of the country.</P>
