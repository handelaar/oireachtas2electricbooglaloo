      <P>Before we commence business today I remind Members that when voting they must pass through the lobby in order to have their names recorded by the Clerk and be counted by the tellers. When a second vote is called immediately after a vote, Members who are on the wrong side of the barrier in the lobby in deference to their colleagues should go around to the centre lobby and proceed to vote from there.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 7, ICC Bank Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 8, National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 48, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 49, Statements on the Clinical Vaccine Trials Report to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter. It is proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 49: (i) the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes; and (iii) Members may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I express our anger, as Deputy Bruton did earlier this week, at the way in which the Minister for Health and Children is dealing with this issue. While this issue will be supposedly debated for approximately one hour this afternoon, the only Members who have been given the report are the Minister, the Government and the Opposition spokespersons. Approximately 30 minutes of that debate will consist of contributions by Members who have not had sight of the report and will first hear what is in it when the Minister speaks on it.  The Taoiseach must give a commitment to this House that this report will be passed to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, given there are questions to be answered by the Department of Health and Children. That will not be done if the report is sent to the Laffoy Commission, where it might have to wait its turn to be examined, which could be many months if not years. I want a commitment from the Taoiseach that the report will be in Members' pigeon holes this morning to enable those participating in the debate to have some time to read it. I want a commitment that this report will be passed to the Oireacthas committee, irrespective of what the Minister wants to do, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Laffoy commission. The report must be passed to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. We will not agree to this debate this afternoon unless we get a commitment on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, will the Taoiseach make this report available to each Member of the House. There has been extensive media coverage of this report, yet some Members have not seen it. That is grossly unfair and inadequate. The Labour Party wishes to support the referral of this report to the Laffoy Commission. We stated that publicly. I want a guarantee from the Taoiseach this can be done. Can he guarantee it will not require a change in legislation in the terms of reference of the Laffoy commission to ensure there is no undue delay in dealing with it and that in terms of the process of that commission it can be done in parallel with investigations rather than be backloaded to the end of them?</P>

      <P>Some Members of the House have been naive and are being sucked in. My concern about this report is that the Department of Health and Children was complicit in some of the implications, having regard to the tests that were carried out in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am coming to. For that reason the Department of Health and Children have questions to answer and the approximate place for it to answer them is not at the Laffoy commission but at an Oireachtas committee. There are strong implications that Department has questions to answer. I will tease this out further in the debate on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard one of the people affected by what is in this report being interviewed this morning. Those people have not seen this report. It is uncaring of the Government to allow a report to be introduced here for a very limited debate. It would be helpful if the Taoiseach would even agree to the debate not finishing today to allow those of us who have not seen the report and may have comments to make on it, which we cannot do sight unseen, to do so. I do not know what is going on in the Department of Health and Children or what the Minister is playing at. Why is there such a frantic hurry, with this report to be rushed in here for one hour and then rushed off to the Laffoy commission? Is there something we do not know or understand about what is going on in this report that the Minister for Health and Children wants it off his desk so quickly? If there was an explanation for this perhaps we would not have to argue about the way it is being handled.</P>

      <P>As I said twice during the week, the Minister will reply this afternoon to many of the questions raised.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that it is not being given to all Members is that the Minister and Government were advised that legally the only way the report could be circulated to everyone, including the people concerned, would be if it were dealt with in the House and if the debate triggered the circulation of the report. That is the reason for the short debate. There is no other reason. That is the advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to reopen the discussion on this matter but, in view of the fact that the Government won the vote, would it be possible to grant a degree of latitude in terms of the time allowed for the contributions of spokespersons? Ten minutes is a limited period in which to make a contribution and perhaps the Chair could allow spokespersons to overrun their time by a few minutes. Few Members will be able to participate in the debate because they have not seen the report.</P>

The Deputy first inquired whether terms of reference would be needed to send the report to the Laffoy commission. The answer to her question is no. The Deputy proceeded to ask if the report could be taken early and I understand that there is no difficulty in doing so, if necessary.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I seek your advice on this matter. It is unprecedented, in the 20 years that I have been a Member, that a report which Members have not seen has been ordered for debate. It is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. I ask you to consider, in the context of the Standing Orders of this House, making a statement on the issue this week on where the rights of Members stand. In a broader context, in no circumstances should Parliament in any parliamentary democracy be required to debate a report of a nature as serious as this which has not been distributed to Members. The advices of the Attorney General, if they are such, are wrong. The Taoiseach should make them known to the House.</P>

In relation to the future, I will protest very strongly if there is any repeat of these arrangements in terms of the availability of information in order that this House can do its work with due regard to the information that we must have if we are to be able to speak with any kind of authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of ICC Bank and to put in place the enabling provisions required to facilitate the future sale of ICC Bank subject to the approval of the House at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies may be aware, the Government decided in mid-1998 to dispose of the State's interest in ICC Bank plc because of the fundamental changes in the banking sector and the economy generally. Following this decision, a sale process was initiated and the House will recall that the Minister for Finance suspended this temporarily in December last year. At that time, the Minister asked the board to review all the options for the future and he reiterated his view that the <i>status quo</i> was not an option.</P>
      <P>The board has carried out such a review and recommended that the bank should pursue the option of seeking a strategic partner or an outright sale because it would benefit from access to capital, broader expertise and, possibly, international opportunities. The staff of the bank fully supported this view and the Minister has mandated the board to explore the options in relation to this course of action. He has also authorised the board to oversee the negotiation of a new employee share ownership plan which was provided for in the ICC Bank Act, 1999, last year.</P>
      <P>The negotiations have been completed. The ESOP has been agreed and the employees accepted it by ballot on 9 October. The ESOP, which is being put in place in the context of a sale, consists of a 14.9% stake in ICC, of which 5% is in return for change in the bank and 9.9% is being purchased.</P>
      <P>One of the main purposes of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank. The current authorised share capital of £40 million has been largely subscribed. The bank is continuing to grow strongly and as long as it remains in public ownership, the shareholder has to provide the necessary share capital. It is the Minister's intention to subscribe for the shares available to him in a £15 million rights issue which the Bank intends to carry out following the enactment of this legislation. The other objective of the Bill is to put in place the enabling provisions to facilitate a change in ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ICC Bank has expanded steadily and has enjoyed consistent profitability. While the State has made equity investments totalling £36.9 million over the years, the bank has grown through <Col N="1136" /> retained profits and deposits and loans to a stage where its balance sheet now amounts to more than £2.8 billion. In 1998, the bank made pre-tax operating profits of £23 million. ICC announced its interim results in April of this year. These showed pre-tax profits up by 64% to £18.3 million and the cost to income ratio reduced to 35.8% from 47.1 % for the same period last year. In any assessment of the contribution of ICC Bank, its performance in the venture capital field deserves special mention. It has had a pioneering role in the provision of such funding in Ireland and the bank continues to hold a market leader role in the venture capital area, an area which is vital to ensure the continuance of the accelerating development of Irish SMEs.</P>
    <P>The strong performance of the bank during the last 12 months shows it is in a strong position. It confirms the strengths of the bank in its specialist market segments. I have every confidence in the bank going forward. However, I see the long-term future of the bank being best served by a change in ownership and both the Minister and I would like this to happen sooner rather than later. The skills and expertise in ICC will be best used under the umbrella of a bigger commercial operation. The board, management and staff of the bank are all agreed in this.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the definitions section and is self explanatory. Section 2 is a standard provision in relation to the expenses of the Minister. Section 3 provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank from its current limit of £40 million to £80 million. It is the Minister's intention, as he has already indicated in public, to make sure that the bank remains adequately capitalised as long as it remains in State ownership. Almost £37 million of the current limit has been subscribed. He proposes, following the enactment of the legislation, to subscribe a further £15 million which will meet the present needs of the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the disposal of shares by the Minister for Finance. It also currently provides that a motion for approval by the House is required in the event that any disposal of shares would result in the Minister's shareholding dropping below 50%. Following concerns raised by the Opposition, particularly by Deputy Noonan, I have reflected on this provision and I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage which will provide that a disposal of shares, other than those for the ESOP, will require a motion of approval from the House. I trust that this will meet the concerns expressed. There is no proposal before the Minister for Finance from the board at present, but he would like to be in a position to react quickly should any such proposal emerge. I hope the motion of approval will meet the concerns of the Deputies in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the continuation of existing guarantees given by the Minister. No guarantees will be given in the future and the amount <Col N="1137" /> which is subject to guarantee will continue to be reduced as existing facilities expire.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a standard provision requiring ICC Bank plc to take relevant action to alter its memorandum and articles of association in the context of the Companies Acts to make them consistent with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 and the accompanying Schedule to the Bill will only come into play if and when the bank is sold. This section provides for the repeal of the ICC Bank Acts, 1933 to 1997, and the deletion of references to ICC in other legislation. The purpose of these repeals and deletions is to ensure that ICC Bank, once sold, will operate on the same basis as any other private commercial bank. They will be given effect by ministerial order under section 8(2) of the Bill. The relevant order will not be made until ICC Bank plc is formally granted a licence by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the Short Title and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, particularly given the Minister's commitment to remove by amendment on Committee Stage the proposal which should not be in the Bill. ICC is a good, small and highly profitable bank, with pre-tax profits up by 64% to £18.3 million. I compliment the effective and efficient management of the bank and the dedicated staff. While the banking industry in general is not the most popular, particularly following the debate the on liabilities of various financial institutions for DIRT, it is noteworthy that the ICC had little or no liability.</P>
      <P>One of my first official functions when I became Minister in 1982 was to open a new ICC office in Limerick. Because of that and my ongoing relationship with the bank I have an interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions arise from the Minister's speech. The policy in the Department of Finance seems to be that ICC should and will be sold. There is probably not much future for small banks. The report of the committee into the banking industry in Ireland, under the auspices of the Department of Finance, indicates there is not much opportunity for smaller banks. They cannot impact on the market and have difficulties of scale which makes it difficult for them to be profitable. They are also vulnerable to take-over or buy out. Even the main commercial banks &ndash; AIB and Bank of Ireland &ndash; are quite vulnerable when their share price is low, as it was earlier this year. The vulnerability arises from a major European bank purchasing them, now that we share a common currency with the main EU countries and where exchange rate difficulties do not arise. The other danger is that an American or Japanese bank which wants a banking presence in the Euro zone will use Ireland as a foothold, given that it is English-speaking. Therefore, while the banking industry is profitable and effective in Ireland, it is vulnerable. While the considerations which apply to AIB and Bank of <Col N="1138" /> Ireland are different from those which apply to ICC, ACC and the TSB, there are also similarities.</P>
    <P>The current management of ICC are doing a very good job. The bank is profitable and the loan book seems good. They have operated very successfully in a niche market and their movement into the provision of venture capital has been successful. Therefore, it seems there is some information which has not been put at the disposal of the House about ICC, and I would like to tease this out with the Minister to see if he can fill the gaps when he is replying on Second Stage or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Last year it seemed ICC would be sold. When the Minister initially made his announcement there seemed to be a certain degree of interest in the market which was sufficient to trigger detailed inquiries from four financial institutions. After they had examined their position in a serious way, one major financial institution went to the line with a developed offer to purchase the bank. Yet sometime between 8 December and Christmas the bottom seemed to fall out of the offer. This has never been fully explained, either in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service or in the House.</P>
    <P>I know there are arguments to suggest the banking industry had changed internationally and had changed substantially in Ireland, that the DIRT liabilities were overhanging the industry, that values which would have been realistic in July were no longer realistic by Christmas and that in effect there was a general marking down of the values of banks, big and small, the consequence of which was that the purchaser of ICC became very reluctant. There is another story in financial circles in Dublin which has not been adequately addressed either by the management or the Department of Finance. It says that when the due diligence was carried out by the purchaser, they did not particularly like the balance of the loan book.</P>
    <P>No adequate explanation has been given to the House as to why a deal which was on the verge of being concluded suddenly collapsed. If I recall correctly, officials of the Minister's Department had spoken to Deputy McDowell and me at the time on the basis of giving speedy passage to legislation before the Christmas recess to enable the sale proceed. It is a good bank, it is well managed and has a good loan book. What I want from the Minister is the strongest possible confirmation of the excellence of this bank in the interests of the bank because the conclusion, which was inconclusive, and the fact that the sale did not go ahead have put an overhang on the prospect of a successful sale of the bank. The Minister is following the right course. ICC should be sold. I do not know whether it can be sold in full or in part. The Minister in this Bill sought the power to sell up to 50% of ICC without referring back to the House. That was a serious mistake. It is a bank owned by the people and the representatives of the people should be given the oppor<Col N="1139" /> tunity to sign off on it in some formal way if a portion is to be sold.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the proposal that the Minister may, without reference to the House, proceed with the employee share ownership plan. We have all agreed that in any sale there should be employer participation and shares should be available to employees. That is already agreed and if the Minister needs the power to make these arrangements without referring again to the House I have no difficulty in agreeing that. However, I do have a difficulty in agreeing a proposition whereby a partner would come in, an arrangement would be made and a deal would be done and Members would read about it in the newspapers. There is too much of this going on here and in circumstances where the ultimate owners of ICC, to the extent of 98.5% of the shares, are the people of Ireland there should be reference back here. I thank the Minister for committing himself to introducing this amendment on Committee Stage. It is the only controversial aspect of the Bill. I have no difficulty with the remainder of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the extension of the share capital from £40 million to £80 million, the issue from the State side is about £38.5 million already. It has almost reached the ceiling available under present legislation and the extension is necessary. As with the raising of all ceilings whether for State boards or State banks I presume there is no intention that the bank will work its way up to the ceiling immediately. I note in the Minister's contribution that he envisages subscribing about £15 million.</P>
    <P>In terms of the equity base of the bank and the issue of shares being sold to employees, I wish to raise one issue with the Minister which I raised with the chief executive of the company when he came before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. ICC is publicly quoted but the Minister for Finance holds more than 98% of the shares. While there is a small private holding of shares, it is not a very active share on the stock market. There is a quotation for ICC but there is not an active market in ICC shares. The basis of share options for employees and the basis of favourable purchase arrangements for shares by employees or the realisation of a capital gain on shares, whether <i>ex gratia</i> or purchase by employees, is the availability of a market. While the ESOP is developed on the one side in the allocation of shares to employees, there is no mechanism that I know of where the employees can realise the value of the share because there is no real value in the share. Is it the intention that they would go to the stock market and that willing purchases would emerge? It is difficult to envisage that happening. I do not know when last there were transactions in ICC shares. The Minister may get advice on when the shares were last traded and what kind of monthly volumes are going through on the stock market. It is not an active share because the private holding of the share is so small. It seems to have a valid ESOP <Col N="1140" /> that a market must be created. I would like to hear the Minister's views on the creation of that market.</P>
    <P>It is a good bank. Any minor clouds that hang over it from the failure of the sale last year should be removed by a very strong statement from the Minister. I support the Minister's policy of proceeding to sell to the best possible partner either on a partnership basis or to sell the bank completely. That is a matter for the management of the bank and the Minister. In the final analysis, this House should sign off on any such arrangement. I welcome the fact that the Minister has given a commitment to amend the Bill to allow us do that.</P>
    <P>The other sections are routine and are of no great consequence. Fine Gael will support the Bill. We have points to make on Committee Stage but we will not divide the House on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading on the grounds that the stated reason for its urgent enactment (in order to increase the funds that may be subscribed for the Bank's share capital in order to restore capital adequacy ratio) should more properly be dealt with in separate legislation, rather than being added to unconnected provisions that enable a change of ownership of the Bank, which deserve more detailed consideration by the Oireachtas and do not require immediate legislation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I opposed the previous effort by the Government to sell off or privatise ICC and I am still opposed to efforts in that regard. My first thought this morning is with the staff and management of the bank because they have been badly served by bungled Government efforts to dispose of it and by a measure of indecision which preceded this Government coming into power in relation to the future of the banks. At best there has been indecision and uncertainty for the past five or six years. Clearly that has not helped either the staff or the bank in terms of their morale or the management of the bank in terms of trying to devise a future for the bank. That is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, we came to the cusp of sale about a year ago in circumstances which, as Deputy Noonan said, have never been properly explained. In the event it did not happen. That was unfortunate because it would have represented a decisive change in where the bank was at. During the course of the summer the Minister's official, Mr. David Doyle, assistant secretary,   came before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 19 July 2000. He gave an interesting expose as to where the bank was at. He explained what had happened in 1999 in relation to the abortive sale of the bank. Effectively he said there was a change in the banking <Col N="1141" /> environment, that financial stocks had fallen over the previous period and that there was increased competitiveness in the market. He spoke specifically about the Bank of Scotland's entry into the mortgage market and Northern Rock's entry into the deposit market and the reduced profitability and increased competition which resulted from that. In response to all of that in December 1999 the Government withdrew ICC from the market for the present. I do not have a difficulty with that analysis. I am prepared to accept it at face value. I do have a difficulty, however, with trying to understand what has changed since then.</P>
    <P>The circumstances and the environment in the banking sector are much the same as they were a year ago. If anything it is more competitive. Banking stocks or stocks in the financial sector generally are lower now than a year ago. In respect of a potential sale, the environment is certainly no better than a year ago and one could easily construct an argument for saying it is a good deal worse than a year ago. The possibilities of the State realising good value for the bank are diminished and obviously the prospects for the bank in any new circumstances are diminished because there is likely to be less interest in acquisition or takeover. I ask the Minister to address what has changed since 1999 to make him willing to undergo another effort to sell. I assume that is what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has said, since he came into power, that &ldquo;the <i>status quo </i>is not an option&rdquo;. He has consistently told us he does not have any particular prescription in mind but that the <i>status quo </i>is not an option. All of us listening to him knew what he meant. He has been seeking to get rid of, sell or float off this bank from the moment he took office, for reasons which are entirely ideological and not driven by the best interests of the bank. Only a few weeks ago, Mr. Michael Quinn, the managing director of ICC, appeared before the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He gave an interesting history of the bank and expressed, relatively briefly, his views as to where the bank should go from here. I read his comments again this morning with some interest. He described how in the 1970s and 1980s the ICC operated as what he termed &ldquo;Ireland's development bank for business, providing SMEs with longer-term finance than was available in the market place&rdquo;. He said some of this finance was provided on concessionary terms for business with support from the State. He went on to say that these were key industry support facilities at a time of sustained, high domestic interest rates and industry under capitalisation. He also spoke about how the bank had managed to blend profitability while still providing concessionary assistance to SMEs. That is precisely the argument that I have been making during the course of this debate &ndash; that there is a real role for a development bank of that kind, that ICC has developed that niche quite well, and that nobody else is doing that job, or at least there have been times <Col N="1142" /> in the past when nobody else has been doing that job.</P>
    <P>I freely acknowledge that it is easier now for SMEs to come across venture capital than it was ten or 20 years ago. None of us, however, has a sufficiently short-term view of the future to consider that we could not find ourselves once again in circumstances where SMEs would require a certain amount of development assistance provided through the banking sector and directly or indirectly through the State. That is the major strategic role ICC has so successfully played in the very recent past and which it could be called upon to play in the future.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the past my party has taken an ideological view that the State sector was good and the private sector was perhaps not quite so good. It has traditionally opposed most privatisations, though not all, that have been carried out in recent years. I do not take a strictly ideological view of this matter. We have to look at semi-State companies on a case by case basis. The primary criterion has to be whether those State companies, or the State ownership of those companies, fulfils any significant strategic role.</P>
    <P>Looking at the three banks &ndash; the TSB, ACC and ICC, but excluding the Post Office Savings Bank &ndash; which are currently within the State sector, one can come to different conclusions. I came to the conclusion quite some time ago that ACC and TSB were effectively, to use Deputy Noonan's phrase, &ldquo;just small banks&rdquo; which would find it difficult over time to remain profitable and to fulfil a significant role. I felt, and still do, that there is no good strategic reason for retaining those banks within the State sector. I supported the effort to set up a new bank and I am following with interest the current efforts to resurrect a proposal of that kind or to formulate a new developmental proposal for those banks. My view is that both banks would be better off in the private sector, which would allow them to form the sort of strategic alliances that would help them in future. I do not take the same view of the ICC, simply because there is a genuine strategic role for that bank to fulfil and to which we may have recourse in future. That is to acknowledge that at the moment its role is less obvious than it might have been in the not too distant past.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance published the document, The Banking Sector: Some Strategic Issues, over the August bank holiday weekend. The report makes interesting reading and looks at the issues of competitiveness, mergers and monopolies. It is very long on analysis but, unfortunately, pretty thin on proposals for charting a future for the banking industry. It mentions the facts with which we are all familiar, that Irish banks are relatively profitable, that there is a concentration in a relatively small number of banks, and that there is a reasonable level of competition in terms of providing services to customers in the domestic retail market. It then uses an interesting phrase, stating that &ldquo;the group was not satisfied that it had sufficient information available to it <Col N="1143" /> on the cost of borrowing for small business, to draw a conclusion on the competitiveness of the cost of this type of financing&rdquo;. This is precisely the area where ICC is active in seeking to assist SMEs by providing facilities for them. I am interested that the group set up by the Department was not able to draw a conclusion that that is being done on a competitive basis, even now, in a significantly more competitive market than we had ten years ago. Many small businesses are still being screwed in their dealings with the banks and that is one significant reason the State should maintain a toe-hold or a competitive leverage within that sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to give the Minister power to sell ICC, subject to a resolution being passed by the House, and it also seeks to increase the capitalisation of the bank. I have no difficulty with increasing the capitalisation of the bank. Traditionally, we have under capitalised virtually all our semi-State companies, and ICC is no exception. I am quite happy to support that move but I continue to be opposed to the way in which the sale mechanism would be approved by this House. I have already said that, in any event, I am opposed in principle to the sale of the bank, but neither am I satisfied to sign what is effectively a blank cheque. Prior to this it would have required legislation to do so. We went through the legislation last year and at least that process allows the House an opportunity to examine proposals that are put before us, either in committee and to a lesser extent on Second Stage. I am not convinced, however, that debate on a resolution would have the same effect. I am not sure we would be able to do it in exactly the same way. There is always a risk that resolutions of the House simply pass without anyone noticing them. In any case, the deal will very likely be done and dusted by then, and the resolution simply becomes a <i>post facto</i> confirmation of something that has already been done by Government. I do not like that position. No doubt it helps the Minister and the board, in going to potential purchasers, if they can say a minimum of legal red tape is required to dispose of the Minister's interest. I certainly would not approach it from that angle. If we are seeking to sell a State asset we should give it every possible scrutiny in this House. I am opposed, therefore, to using the mechanism that is set out in the Bill, which is effectively a blank cheque. In the current circumstances of the banking market, it could be a fire sale. This is not a good time to sell because the market is not good for obtaining full value for the State. It is not in the interests of the bank and the honest answer is that we should not sell it, period.</P>
    <P>I have a couple of questions concerning ESOPs. An ESOP has recently been approved by the Government and I assume that at this stage it has been accepted in principle by the staff, as well. It is a good thing. I like the principle of participation by the work force in ownership of the company through profit sharing in the event that <Col N="1144" /> the company is profitable. I do not, however, like ESOPs or ESOTs to be used as a bribe to facilitate privatisation. In principle, there is no reason we should not extend part ownership of virtually all the semi-State companies to their work forces As the Minister knows, that was done with Aer Lingus some five or six years ago when 5% ownership was granted to the staff. I see no reason we should not move to do that now. Within the State sector, ESOPs are effectively being used as a bribe to facilitate privatisation, but that link needs to be broken and should be broken forthwith.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will know, I have a difficulty in principle with the disposal of the bank. I also have a difficulty with the mechanism proposed for this in the Bill, and for that reason I have moved the amendment in my name.</P>

      <P>I must contradict Deputy McDowell as regards the morale of staff in ICC. Recently, I spoke in a social context to junior and middle-ranking staff members in ICC. I have spoken to senior members of the ICC in preparation for my contribution to the Bill. I can tell Deputy McDowell that the morale in the ICC is as high as it could possibly be. They are very excited by the direction in which the bank is going and by the possibility of its future sale or takeover and development.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell accepted that the turbulence in the financial sector generally and in shares was part of the reason for the failed sale of the bank. This sort of turbulence occurs. At present, there is turbulence in the technology sector where the share price of many technology stocks have fallen by about 90% over the past few months.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why, if that turbulence took place so long ago, the sale has not taken place in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be argumentative but what I said was that nothing has changed since. Financial stocks are still as low, there is greater competitiveness, and profitability in the sector is lower than it was a year ago. I said that nothing has changed since a year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says nothing has <Col N="1145" /> changed. He complains the Government cannot sell the bank or do anything with it while at the same time putting forward a motion that the bank should remain in State hands. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot give out about the failure of the Government to sell or deal with the bank while at the same time saying the State should not do it.</P>
      <P>On the question of State ownership and the strategic State role of the bank, even Deputy McDowell will understand that a small bank such as the ICC will not work in the times in which we live. The products and services the bank has to offer are insufficient to keep the business customers it has at the leading edge or fully satisfied given the financial products available generally in the marketplace. To develop, the ICC must find a larger partner in whatever way it can.</P>
      <P>On the question of the ESOT, as opposed to an ESOP, I understand from my conversations with staff members that they are delighted with it. They will have to fund a share of about 9%. I have a problem with ESOTs generally because I find that all the shares are put together and a cosy board position is created either for someone from the trade union movement or a member of the Labour Party approaching retirement.</P>
      <P>On the question of the capital requirement, the bank is definitely growing significantly and it is well acknowledged. In the first six months of this year, profits have increased by 64% to £18 million. Although figures are not given, there is no reason to believe that the trend will not continue. Advances to customers are around the £2 billion mark and the company has reduced its costs to income ratio. It has significantly increased the earnings per share and the dividends it pays to the State have increased dramatically. The amount of tax it paid last year increased to about £4.7 million. The bank is growing, but it cannot do so on a base of £40 million capital. As Deputy Noonan stated, £38.5 million is being used so it needs topping up, and I am delighted to see it is being topped up to £80 million in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The enabling provision for the sale is necessary for the bank to be able to operate and I am delighted the Minister stated that, on Committee Stage, he will bring forward an amendment which will mean that any sale will go through on agreement of a motion in the House. Lending to customers was £1.4 billion in 1998 and increased to £2 billion this year. That is an increase of about 40% and is a significant one in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards privatisation, contrary to Deputy McDowell, I believe the ICC would die in the long-term if it did not have the type of scale needed in the current financial climate. It needs to be able to access new products for all its customers. Given its size, it needs a larger market in which to sell any new products it develops and to be competitive. It also needs the international stage to obtain the financial backing to ensure it becomes a major player. The Irish market is not sufficiently large to contain a bank such as this <Col N="1146" /> which is open to development and increasing in size.</P>
    <P>On the question of venture capital, I remember 30 years ago the ICC gave loans to companies and took a small equity in them, not because it was greedy but to give a helping hand and strengthen management controls so that customers would benefit from the expertise and discipline placed on those companies. The ICC did that well at the time and it has developed its venture capital to such a stage that it is now the market leader in venture capital in the software and technology sectors.</P>
    <P>It has done so well in the management of those sectors that significant funds have been generated. A £100 million fund has already been taken up and another £100 million fund will go to market shortly. Some £20 million to £30 million was invested by the ICC in small software technology companies in the past year. For this the ICC takes minority stakes of between 10% and 30% with a view to getting a capital gain on those stakes along with helping the companies in which it invests to develop and prosper. As regards equipment leasing and asset financing, the staff of the ICC are exemplary in that they knock on doors, hunt down customers and help them to get business.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the people involved. The chairman of the ICC, Phil Flynn, is doing a superb job. He came up from the unions. He has done a marvellous job in any position he has had recently, be it conciliator in trade union talks or labour relations and certainly as chairman of ICC Bank. I pay tribute to his work.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. The ICC managed the European Investment Bank funds in the 1970s for the Government. It was a partner in the early 1990s managing the interest subsidy loans. It is not that long ago that interest rates were going through the roof. It is easy to forget that, given the current low interest rates. Even if it sells it, I look forward to the State continuing to have a good relationship with the ICC Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should state my interest in this at the outset, as I have been a client of ICC Bank for more than 25 years. One of the luckiest breaks I got in my earlier days in business was probably the fact that, while a local branch of another bank was unable to see the merit of a proposal I had, I secured the loan from ICC and at a much more competitive rate.</P>
      <P>The morale of the company has been spoken about. However, it is my strong view that every aspect of the company, including the board, management and staff, is in very good shape. Most people are looking forward in a very positive way to this Bill being passed and the future development of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ICC has been one of the few continually profitable semi-State bodies over the years, along with Aer Rianta, which is in my area. It has not been given the credit it deserves for its part in the pro<Col N="1147" /> motion of small and medium size enterprises over the past 30 or 40 years. It has been one of the leading factors in the promotion of small businesses. It has moved with the economy and has been very much to the forefront in the success stories of many of the excellent small and medium sized companies in the software, technology and telecommunications areas. It has also successfully brought many companies to the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>My colleague mentioned the venture capital arm of the company. That is probably one of the most important aspects of the strength and growth of the company and illustrates the importance of what the Bill is trying to achieve, in terms of the added funding that is being made available.</P>
    <P>The success of ICC Bank has been overshadowed by developments in worldwide banking, where banks have tended to become larger to provide protective financing at a competitive rate. If the bank is to go forward, as the board proposes, to compete in the financial markets, it may need to be strengthened by the addition of a partner.</P>
    <P>The success of the economy over the past number of years has meant that ICC Bank's lending has increased threefold over the past six years. However, it is important to remember that, as Deputy Ardagh said, years ago when the economy was in a very different state, many companies were in serious trouble in relation to interest rates and the lack of available funding. The interest subsidy loans, which were proposed by the then Government and implemented by ICC, saved many jobs. As the economy grows, the changes made in section 3, providing for the allocation of extra funding, will allow ICC to compete and promote many of the companies in our economy that are looking for funding.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly in the employee share option plan. Such plans have been a success in our economy and in many of the companies where they have been introduced. I am pleased the Minister told us today that this was agreed by the staff and management on 9 October.</P>
    <P>If a suitable partner emerges for the company, the expertise at board, management and staff level that has been spoken about today will be very much to the forefront in promoting a new company and ensuring it plays a major role in financing our economy.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, said he will table an amendment to section 4 on Committee Stage, following concerns raised by the Opposition, which will provide that a disposal of any shares, other than those for the employee scheme, will require a motion of approval from the House. It is important that that will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The movement of Irish industry into the computer hardware and software development sphere and telecommunications has been underwritten by many investments by ICC through its own ven<Col N="1148" /> ture capital and other software funds that it manages for many pension funds. Over the next number of years, there will be rapid changes in the relationship between customers and banks, with greater partnership orientated banking, through the use of venture capital seed finance, rather than traditional loan finance. We will also see a greater influence of external banks in the Irish market, especially in asset financing and new product development.</P>
    <P>Over the next number of years, we will see the development of indigenous small companies, tied into the technology of the major telecommunications companies coming into Ireland. In my constituency of Dublin North, there have been announcements by major companies coming into Ireland. The production and development of their products in this country will lead to many opportunities for indigenous companies.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. ICC has been a great success story but it has not been given the credit it deserves in many areas. It has been very important in the development of many of the smaller companies in our economy, which has led to the creation of many jobs. The expertise in the company will survive any changes in the international market, depending on what proposal comes forward from the board and agreed by the House at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Before we deal with the provisions of the Bill, especially those dealing with increasing the share capital of ICC and preparing it for sale, it is important to acknowledge the contribution ICC has made to the development of industry in this country over the years. As many previous speakers said, at many times in the past when other lending institutions did not have the confidence to support certain proposed ventures, ICC stepped in and supported those ventures at very keen rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a change in the type of support in which ICC is now involved, particularly the funding of tourism projects, transport and the communications sector. One of the newest areas in which it is now involved is renewable energy sources projects. As we approach budget time, I ask the Minister for Finance to look at this sector. It is very welcome that ICC has acknowledged the growth potential of renewable energy, particularly wind energy, and its benefits for the economy and the environment. Individual private landowners in an area with the capacity to develop wind energy could only get finance, support and guidance from a continental organisation. However, the ICC now supports this important growth area and, no doubt because of the market potential, it is on a winner and has recognised that. Would that other lending institutions would do likewise and support small farmers living in disadvantaged areas who see the potential in this area. Will the Minister and the Minister for Finance level the playing pitch in the forthcoming budget for such capital and personal <Col N="1149" /> investment? I hope they will respond positively. It is important that the State recognises the significance of developing this area and gives support by way of tax incentives or otherwise to the development of alternative energy.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that any lending institution that has invested in communications, as has the ICC, was guaranteed tremendous returns over the past number of years. Perhaps that is why there is such significant growth in its investments and growth profits. There is a great turnover in that area. I acknowledge the part played by the ICC in supporting small industry in the past when other institutions did not want to go down that road.</P>
    <P>This legislation prepares the bank for sale. When the ICC, TSB and ACC were previously offered for sale nobody wanted to buy them. There were four buyers in the case of ICC initially and then it was whittled down to one, the Bank of Ireland, which withdrew at the last moment. There is an acknowledgement that they were offered for sale in a hasty and unprepared fashion. However, under this legislation the ICC will be prepared for sale. It was mentioned at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and General Affairs that it would be two years before the ICC would be sold.  Either Mr. Quinn or Mr. Flynn stated that. Will the Minister say why in the view of the executive and management of the bank it will take so long, particularly as this legislation has been introduced? </P>
    <P>Just as in the case of the ACC and TSB it is important that the new purchaser continues the policies of the ICC. I do not know if the Minister will have an input to that but it is important that acquisition of ICC does not lead to a sea change in policy. If there were, it would be a retrograde step particularly for those who recognise the contribution and support given by ICC in a unique way to its clients. I hope there will be some safeguards for its customers.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that £100,000 per employee would be the net proposed income as a result of the offer to them in relation to share capital. It is obvious that employees would seriously consider the award and value of such shares. Is this being done to get their support? If that is the carrot, what is the other side? There will be changes in work practices, extended working hours to regularise them with the banking hours of similar lending institutions and so on. There must be give and take but was this incentive introduced solely for the purpose of getting employees to accept the possibility of a new owner? There was a doubt in the minds of many employees of this and the other banks about their future employment conditions if the banks were sold. In many towns the ACC, TSB and ICC operate side by side in prominent locations. It was obvious that if they merged some employees would have to take redundancy packages. If we are offering the ICC for sale again, which we are preparing to do under this legislation, I hope safeguards will be provided with regard to conditions and continuation of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> Deputy Ardagh pointed out that the ICC is a small bank. Although there is a growth in lending and profits over the past two years, we are saying it is too small to continue in its present form. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. The bank is highly profitable with £18 million profits in the six months to last April and is enjoying huge growth with a 24% growth in lending. These are positive indicators of an organisation that is working well and has a future. It also has the potential to secure more customers. Despite those indicators it is still said that the bank must be prepared for sale. Are we going in the wrong direction? Are we just sprucing it up for somebody else to reap the benefit? That is my only reservation in this instance. It would be different if the bank were ailing and needed constant support from Government. However, it can stand alone. It has shown that it is profitable and can expand, yet we still choose to off load it.</P>
    <P>I will support the Bill. I again acknowledge the contribution the ICC has made in a particular sector of the economy. That sector will always be there and it would be unfortunate for industrial growth if the sale of ICC to a concern such as the Bank of Ireland, if it does renew its interest, will mean there will no longer be the same level of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment the Minister of State and welcome the proposals in this legislation. I have always been a strong supporter of the ICC Bank. I saw the good work it did in the west of Ireland helping small and medium enterprises at a time when such industrialists found it difficult to get help. Preferential loans and other products were available as a package to people in industry.</P>
      <P>My only criticism of the ICC was that people in the west of Ireland had to travel to Limerick to conduct their business with the bank. At the time the bank only had branches in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. The Galway branch was opened in 1992 and the Waterford and Belfast branches opened later. It was a small but good network. The commercial loans and savings it offered were good for industry. We tend to forget that interest rates were high but competitive preferential rates were always available from ICC. That was of great benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a welcome day for the west of Ireland when the Galway office of ICC was opened in 1992. Subsequently, other regions saw the great benefit of dealing with ICC. It is a little ironic that the final bidder for ICC, the Bank of Ireland, and other commercial banks are withdrawing their branches from smaller towns when ICC is doing more business with industry in those areas. <Col N="1151" /> Bank of Ireland has announced that from next Monday it will restrict the cashing of cheques in its branches. In a way the commercial banks are forcing people to open accounts. I say that in passing because I intend to discuss the Bank of Ireland later.</P>
    <P>The House has previously discussed the question of disposing of the State's interest in ICC. It was decided to do that in July 1998. At that time up to ten banks expressed an interest in acquiring the bank but only three firm indications of interest were received by the closing date in August 1999. One of those banks, National Australia Bank, withdrew from the process and two banks remained. They carried out the preliminary due diligence exercise and met key management and union officials. When the Irish Intercontinental Bank withdrew there was one remaining bid from the Bank of Ireland which was received on the final deadline, 19 October 1999. That bid was less than the top range of the earlier indicative bids. It was no surprise, therefore, that a decision to withdraw the ICC Bank from the market might be required. We discussed that during the debate on the ICC Bank Bill, 1999.</P>
    <P>Bank of Ireland made it known to the Minister in December 1999 that it no longer wished to proceed with the acquisition. It acknowledged the strength of ICC Bank in its specialist market but it felt that acquiring the bank was not the best way to develop its SME lending business. The Minister withdrew ICC Bank from the market.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister made it clear that it is his intention to ensure that the bank remains adequately capitalised while it is under State ownership. The authorised share capital was last changed in 1997 when it was increased to £40 million from £12 million, a figure that was set in 1971. Between 1997 and 1999 total assets of the bank increased by 53% to more than £2.4 billion. Banking is a capital intensive business and the Minister has had to waive the last two dividends to boost the bank's shareholder funds. This allowed the bank to continue growing, a fact that is reflected in the excellent interim results for 2000 with profits of £18.3 million, representing an increase of 64% on the same period in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about another provision in the Bill which relates to the question of looking at all the options for a change in ownership. There were enabling provisions in the ICC Bank Bill, 1999, but there is an initial provision in this Bill requiring the Minister for Finance to seek a motion of approval prior to making any disposal of his shares. It is right and proper that the House should have the opportunity to consider the matter at the appropriate time. It is also important that we ensure the capital arrangements are put in place now.</P>
    <P>The ICC Bank has been a great success story. It has provided great support for indigenous industry. I am glad, therefore, that it is to be put on a good footing.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the management <Col N="1152" /> and staff of ICC Bank. I know the staff and management of the Galway branch which was set up in 1992. I hope their work will lead to continued profits and success for ICC Bank. I again welcome what has been announced in this legislation and thank the Minister for bringing this Bill forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about ICC Bank. In assessing the success of ICC Bank, it is important to look not just at the bank itself but at its contribution to the development of Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in relation to small and medium-sized business. The traditional banks were very conservative in their approach to providing venture and seed capital to small and medium-sized business breaking into areas of industry that were heretofore new to this country, particularly telecommunications, software and other forms of e-commerce. ICC Bank's contribution to developing that type of market has been beneficial to the economy at large.</P>
      <P>Last year the Bank of Ireland expressed an interest in purchasing ICC Bank. It carried out a due diligence exercise but later indicated that it would not be proceeding. From the outside that might have looked as if there was a problem with ICC. I believe, however, that the problem was within the financial sector. Financial stocks had dropped. New banks were entering the Irish market. The opening up of the market and the entry of the Bank of Scotland meant competition. That was new to the Irish banking scene. Rather than there being a problem with ICC Bank, there was a problem with the traditional banks who were unsure where they were going and how they could address the more competitive market that heretofore had not existed in our economy.</P>
      <P>I have always been concerned that lack of competition among lending institutions has stymied the development of our economy. We have two large banks &ndash; AIB and Bank of Ireland. These have not been proactive enough. They have not been brave enough in embracing new types of development or in providing capital to small and medium-sized companies entering unknown territory. But for ICC Bank, many very successful companies, innovative and very profitable companies that grew to be publicly quoted companies, would not have developed.</P>
      <P>ICC Bank should be sold off to grow and develop. At the very least, it needs a partner, because of the competitive nature of and changes within the whole banking sector here. It has proved itself a success. It is well managed by the board, the management and the staff, which comprise a very dedicated group of people. The level of expertise it possesses would be of great benefit to any larger institution that wishes to purchase ICC Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ICC Bank is to be sold, there are one or two things I would like to see encompassed in any agreement. For example, in the event of a downturn in the economy or of the Government having <Col N="1153" /> to bring forward a scheme along the lines of the interest subsidy loan or a venture capital scheme, or in the event of a further take-off in the economy resulting in small and medium-sized businesses having difficulty getting access to funding, there should be some mechanism in place whereby the apparatus that is ICC Bank could still be used for such schemes after it has been taken over by another institution. It is something that might never arise. However, it would not cost anything to ensure the goodwill of whoever purchases this bank in giving a guarantee that if ever the Government required its services in bringing forward a scheme to encourage further growth and development of small and medium-sized businesses they would be, at the very least, co-operative. I would be concerned if that was not part of any sale, and it would not affect the price we hope to achieve for the bank.</P>
    <P>The fact that ICC Bank was not sold last year was due more to the downturn in financial stocks and the concerns of the larger financial institutions than to problems within ICC Bank. The Minister has in the interim included in this Bill a provision for an increase of share capital from £40-£80 million. This gives the bank scope and opportunity because, over the last five or six years, it has achieved remarkable success, even against a backdrop of uncertainty. There has been talk for some time of selling off some of the family jewels and it was intended from an early stage that ICC Bank was one of the institutions that would be sold off. From that point of view, it has done remarkably well against that backdrop of uncertainty. Its profits and the increase in its capital assets is an indication of that. It is an indication also of the excellence of its staff and the expertise it has built up over many years. Deputy Kitt referred to the fact that the bank opened up branches in Waterford, Galway and Belfast in that interim period. This shows that there was confidence in the bank. Anybody looking to purchase ICC Bank would have to acknowledge that even against a backdrop of uncertainty it was able to perform.</P>
    <P>There is one thing the Minister might clarify. Given that ICC Bank is a publicly quoted company, has there ever been any trading on the market of ICC Bank stock? If not, why? It baffles me that if ICC Bank is a publicly quoted company there would never have been trade in ICC stocks.</P>
    <P>This Bill is preparing ICC Bank for sale. I certainly hope prospective purchasers know how much it is worth. I would be concerned if only one bidder conducted a due diligence exercise and subsequently did not offer what we would consider a fair price for ICC Bank. It is important that ICC Bank should be marketed well and its strong points highlighted at every opportunity. Members of this House have an opportunity to do likewise today and point out how great a benefit is the wealth of expertise that has been built up in ICC Bank. In buying this bank, a buyer is not just buying bricks and mortar but a wealth of expertise in areas that other banks are only now <Col N="1154" /> realising. In the dark old days of the 1970s, 1980s and even the early 1990s, ICC Bank was at the cutting edge, looking at innovative companies and new forms of development. Reference was made earlier to wind energy. ICC Bank was looking at this as an opportunity. In the 1980s it was looking at software and e-commerce. It has always been to the fore. If that were to be lost, I would regret that very much. I hope that whoever purchases this bank will allow it a certain amount of autonomy to continue in a focused manner what it is best at, that is, providing capital to small and medium-sized business and start-up business where it sees potential that other banks and lending institutions frequently fail to recognise.</P>
    <P>As I said on a Second Stage debate in 1999, I would have a difficulty in selling a State owned bank to a company that does not have a tax clearance certificate. That is an important marker to put down. A publican when renewing his licence must have a tax clearance certificate. We must ensure that requirement is rigidly enforced when selling any State asset. The people own this bank. With regard to people who renage on their duties or are not co-operative in paying their fair share of tax, they should first and foremost have a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue. An inquiry has been held and most of the banks have settled with the Revenue. If any bank is interested in purchasing the ICC, even if it is offering top dollar, as a point of principle, we should not negotiate until such time as it has made a full and final settlement with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I thank the staff of ICC, the management and the board for many years of excellent service they have provided and the contribution they have made to creating the Celtic tiger, particularly in the areas of e-commerce, software and many of the innovative developments for which Ireland is now renowned. We owe a great deal of gratitude to the management, board and the staff of the ICC for their years of service. I hope their share option scheme will go well and that the staff will become wealthy from the sale of the bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Bill, as this is the first time I have spoken on the ICC, although I have had an interest in it for the past 20 years. I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Kelleher said. The debate on the Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect on the role the ICC has played and can play in our industrial development. One of the hallmarks of a rapidly expanding economy is that old friends are often easily forgotten. I am not sure whether reflecting on history is good or bad, but I remember times in the 1970s and 1980s when people with great enterprise and flair, who had put every single penny of their disposable income into enterprises, were not helped by the big banks. Those people put their case to the big banks, but from the banking perspective the return on their enterprise was not considered satisfactory and those enterprising individuals <Col N="1155" /> had to look elsewhere. While that was not always the case, it happened on many occasions. I remember that for many people to whom I tried to give a hand, the same as many other Members, it was the ICC that came up trumps. The ICC never acted in a lame dog capacity. It was not a St. Vincent de Paul outfit, as one cannot run a bank on that basis.</P>
      <P>The ICC had an ethos, which was not to be found in the bank fraternity until recently, although if there was a downturn in the economy I am not sure if that ethos would exist. The ICC's ethos was one of genuine help and interest. That ethos is terribly important in the banking sector and it is also found in the credit unions. While our big banks are doing extremely well and it is important for our economy that they do well, it is also important to understand there are niche markets, and ICC was in one of them. I am wise enough to understand that this Bill is a preparation for another resale or attempt at reselling or refloating ICC. I do not consider there is anything wrong with that, as I assume that if it is left the way it is it will be outflanked by the major banks, particularly if our economy keeps pressing ahead. It would be preferable if the ICC got a partner with an ethos compatible to its own or if is subsumed into a much bigger outfit ICC's ethos would shine through, in other words, that the ICC under a new banner would be good at doing what it is currently good at doing.</P>
      <P>I understand fully that in the big bad world of sales and commercial activity if one puts a burden on a title, as in the case of a house, it is difficult to get a buyer. If and when ICC is offered for sale or a partnership arrangement is agreed a burden should not be placed on it. Given the State's involvement in ICC, it would be remiss of us if we did not put down a marker that there should not be a legal burden on that asset, but we must realise that the commercial environment is such that a purchaser will not touch ICC unless there is money in it for that purchaser. There is a niche market for those enterprising young and not so young people. The effort they must make is pure torture. While I am not a businessman, I have been associated with many businesses over the years. If one wants to stay up at night, one should try starting a small business. It is nearly as bad as politics, maybe it is worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unbelievable what such people go through. I speak on their behalf. They and their families put in untold hours of work and experience great anxiety for years and years before some of those projects get off the ground. I know of such people who have been struggling for years. We all know those who have been successful. Their names are on the tips of our tongues. For every successful entrepreneur, there are five or six struggling and five or six more who have gone under. While there are a multiplicity <Col N="1156" /> of reasons a project works or fails, it is important to note that a helping hand at the right time is extremely beneficial. One of the reasons for the continued progress of the credit union movement is its ethos of giving a helpful hand when people require it. The same principle applies to enterprise. If one thought that one's gale day had come up for the repayment of one's loan, a hallmark of ICC was that it would say it trusted one, it had confidence in what one was doing and it would change the date of repayment or reorganise the repayments. The ICC operated in a humane yet businesslike way. It was not in the business of writing off debts and anyone who checks its portfolio will realise that. Much of the success in industrial terms of small and medium sized enterprises &ndash; and not so small enterprises &ndash; in the 1970s and 1980s was due to the helping hand and culture of understanding found in the ICC. For that we owe it a great deal of gratitude. I hope that will not be lost to the nation, irrespective of who buys it. I assume there will be some compatibility in terms of the purchaser who will want to buy the ICC and with what that purchaser will want this arm of its business to do in the future. That is why we should not sell ICC just for the sake of selling it. There was a debacle last time and though I am not privy to what happened, whatever happened was a mess and was no credit to anyone. I do not know what happened and I am not sure if anyone else knows either. Suffice to say that the ethos regarding the business community in ICC remains &ndash; whoever takes it over. I assume that who ever buys or goes into partnership with ICC will be doing so for that reason. I do not see them dramatically changing what ICC was good at, because if they did a niche market would open up that would have to be filled by someone else, though I do not know who.</P>
      <P>We speak glibly about entire capital but the problem with it is the ability to see the opportunity for a project to go ahead or not. The idea from the banker's point of view is to be good or lucky enough to spot a venture that will work so that one can be sure of getting one's money back. The problem for an individual is that his or her money is gone into the project also and often that money does not come back. That is the great argument in this area.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the sale of ICC. Other speakers have emphasised different aspects of the sale. We should move slowly and pick the partner as best we can but we must also get good value for the State's investment over the years. I have always felt that the administration and board of the ICC were always above board. It passed the litmus test on the DIRT issue; I understand it was not really involved which is important and to its eternal credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC was to small industry what the ACC was to farming until recently. There was a parallel there until the big banks moved in on the agriculture industry. I always had a soft spot for the <Col N="1157" /> ACC because it helped out greatly over the years, but this situation is almost the same.</P>
    <P>More than eyebrows were raised last year when the Bank of Scotland entered the market. There was a fair degree of scurrying by the bigger banks. There is still a monopoly in this area. The banks can talk about their various products and the competition but they are extraordinarily close to each other on charges. There is no great variety there &ndash; there may be a tweak here and there but they are taking branches out of small towns and villages all over the country and it does not matter which one of them is doing it. Against that, one should always have a bank like the ICC which has cut a niche out for itself in the world of industry.</P>
    <P>It is important to a modern economy to have sound, well-financed banks. Some people may say they have inordinate profit levels but it is important they are sound. One must also remember in the context of ICC that most of the profits of our two major banks is generated outside this jurisdiction and that that is the way banking will go in the future.</P>
    <P>I have little expertise in flotation on the stock exchange and what this means for bank staff. I find it hard to understand that as the shares are not traded as such there is very little activity in them. What does this mean for people who will get shares? I understand this deal has already been made.</P>
    <P>The share capital ceiling is to be raised from £40 million to £80 million; I assume that is a technical matter and there is no reason to believe that in two weeks' time the £80 million barrier will be met. I understand it is expected to rise to no more than another £50 million. Obviously with the progress of the economy it is normal that this sort of thing would happen and nobody has a problem with that.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have said, various projects such as e-commerce are coming on stream while other projects came into being some years ago, such as the short-term small industry division of the IDA. Factories were being built in a great rush 20 years ago in an effort to get factories into every spot in the country but that all died away in the 1980s. We noticed that many of the enterprising people involved in the boards of those small industries found it quite difficult to get funding for both the projects they were in and locating them where they wanted. I hope the ICC will become involved in newer areas such as e-commerce and sustainable wind energy. Since taking up my new portfolio I have visited some wind farms around the country and there is no doubt about the need for huge capital input in this area, as five wind towers cost almost £4 million. That gives some indication of the kind of investment needed. I hope the ICC will be very involved in this and one hopes the Government attends to this in the upcoming budget. In fairness to this Government and its predecessor, I am led to believe by the wind energy sector that the <Col N="1158" /> legislation in place gives every opportunity to get into this but the problem is the high capital cost.</P>
    <P>Everyone understands that wind energy is a green energy source, is a great import substitution and is a great alternative to greenhouse gas producers. So is wave energy, though we have not done as much with wave energy as we should. When one considers that there is hardly a day in Ireland when there is not a breeze of some kind along the west coast it is obvious that there is a good future for this industry. However, we must have the ability to fund it in such a way as to enable ordinary people with a business idea to be backed to the hilt in order that they can make a living out of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope the reservations being sincerely expressed by so many Deputies will be taken into account when the ICC is being sold. The ICC played an important role in the country's industrial development, but it will do even greater things in the future once the right partner is found. The expertise developed by those employed by the ICC must be available to further boost our economy in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the ICC in the context of the Bill. It is no harm, at this stage, to place on record some historical facts about the ICC. The bank was established in 1933 by the first Fianna Fáil Government which identified the need for&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation to establish it was prepared by the previous Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;economic development in the country. The ICC was established to be a source of finance for indigenous industries at a time when money was flowing out of the country and into the London stock market and not being used to strengthen our economy. Through the establishment of the bank, funds were made available to allow people to establish businesses. Companies such as CRH, Newbridge Cutlery, the Irish Sugar Company and many others can thank the ICC for helping them to establish their operations and develop them over the years.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the commercial banks were not keen on providing finance to those with burgeoning businesses. It was left to the ICC in many instances to provide seed capital, working capital, etc., to people who wished to establish a business. In those days, the ICC was in a position to provide loans at interests rates lower than those on offer by the commercial banks because it was in a position to obtain funds from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank and benefited from support from the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC's function was to help people in establishing their businesses and to encourage the growth of indigenous industries, and it was successful in that regard. However, times have changed and the commercial banks are now in a <Col N="1159" /> position to provide loans at rates as low as those offered by the ICC. In that context, we must reconsider the <i>raison d'être</i> of the ICC and decide whether it should continue to operate as it did in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance reached the conclusion that the ICC should consider its position and, consequently, it was put up for sale. None of the ten interested parties, the last of which was the Bank of Ireland, decided to proceed with the purchase of the bank. The main reason the Bank of Ireland did not purchase the ICC was because the two operate in much the same market. In addition, the ICC had moved away from its initial mandate, namely, the provision of funding for those seeking to establish businesses. It moved away not out of choice but because times have changed. Much of the money it now lends goes into asset backed projects, the building industry and other businesses of that nature which are not involved primarily in job creation.</P>
    <P>What percentage of the loans issued by the ICC goes towards the establishment of small and medium enterprises and what percentage is invested in asset backed projects? With regard to lending policy, does the bank comply in full with the Central Bank's guidelines on property lending? Perhaps the Minister will provide answers to those two questions in his reply.</P>
    <P>The bank's financial performance has been extremely good. Any business which has shown a year-on-year profit from 1993 to the present has undoubtedly been a success. In recent years the bank's performance has been good. It doubled its 1995 profit of £12 million before tax to £25 million in the year up to October 1999. In the past six months, its half-year profit has increased by 64% to £18.3 million. That performance is not to be sneezed at.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for managing the bank have performed exceptionally well in recent years. They have tightened up they way things are run and the profit margins have increased as a result. These people are doing an excellent job, particularly in light of the circumstances in which they currently find themselves. I referred earlier to the bank's original mandate and the changes made to it over the years. I intend no criticism of the current management because its members are doing an outstanding job and enhancing the bank's value. They encouraged the movement of the bank into the area of venture capital and it is now obtaining good returns in respect of the funds it has provided in that regard.</P>
    <P>The bank's funding comes from commercial sources in the domestic and international markets. It raises its funds from the inter-bank market, domestic and international bank deposits, through syndicated loans, by deposits from financial companies, business introducers and from corporate and personal depositors. It has been successful in raising funds, lending them out and raising a profit margin on them. The management of the bank has done an excellent job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> The ICC has identified a niche in the market, namely, in the area of software investment, and it has two specialist software investment funds which have proved particularly profitable. For a small bank to be successful, it must concentrate on such niche areas and I compliment the management of the ICC on not sitting on its laurels. Its members have identified, pursued and been successful in grasping opportunities that have arisen.</P>
    <P>Electronic commerce is growing at an enormous rate. The bank has foreseen the need to move with the times and it is becoming involved in the electronic banking area. I am delighted, however, that is has not lost sight of the necessity of having a personal relationship with its customers. As a small bank, its road to success must lie in having hands-on and personal contact with its customers. The bank sees this as a priority. Having discussed the matter with management, it will continue, even in this age of electronic banking, to maintain personal contact with its customers.</P>
    <P>The question of DIRT was raised with the chief executive officer of the bank when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service recently. He confirmed that its DIRT liability was minimal. When one considers the large liabilities of other semi-State and private institutions, one is glad that the bank is operating a clean business and that its DIRT liability is next to nil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelleher mentioned that whoever is in the market for purchasing the bank should be required to produce a tax clearance certificate. While this could only apply to Irish based institutions, I agree that if any of them expresses an interest, it should confirm that its tax affairs are in order. Applicants for grants and licences are already required to do this. The Minister of State should, therefore, ensure the tax affairs of any institution which is in the market for purchasing the bank are in order.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that section 3 provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank from its current limit of £40 million to £80 million. At a time when it is doing so well, it is important that it is not constricted by a lack of share capital. It is welcome to hear that it will have adequate share capital as long as it remains in State ownership.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement with regard to section 4. He indicated that following concerns raised by the Opposition there will be no disposal of shares without the matter first being put before the House. It is right and proper that there should be no sale of State property without Members on boths side of the House being given an opportunity to express their views. I, therefore, welcome the Minister of State's decision to introduce an amendment to section 4 on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Where employees have a share in the ownership of a company, be it publicly or privately owned, they tend to see it as their own own and <Col N="1161" /> put in more and a better effort on its behalf. This is only natural. ESOPs have, therefore, proved to be a success. Where employees are of the view that a company belongs to them, they will see it as something to be improved and enhanced; otherwise, there is a danger that it will be ignored. I, therefore, agree with the employment share option programme in principle. While I agree that it may be used in a situation such as this as a sop to accept change, it should be enhanced and used in many organisations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment and congratulate the management of ICC Bank which has done a tremendous job down the years. Times have changed since the 1930s. The time has come to look at a new model. I wish the board, management and the Minister of State every success in finding the bank's proper niche in the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to the debate on the Bill. ICC Bank has made a major contribution to the economy since its establishment in 1933 under the Industrial Credit Act. It was a time, at the start of the economic war, when, generally, a protectionist attitude was adopted towards Irish industry and when we were still trying to come to terms with our new found independence and freedom. We had lost many entrepreneurs. Most of the big investors prior to the War of Independence had slowly moved out of the economy with the result that most of the available resources were in the hands of a small number of a very wealthy people. Most of the money was moved through the stock exchange in England. There was, therefore, a reason to establish the ICC Bank which has played a very significant role in Irish life since its establishment. It has a tremendous record. I recognise the contribution made by its management and staff over the years. I have always found the management and staff of my local branch to be very positive, co-operative and helpful and totally responsible in the decisions they make. That is the reason the bank has been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early 1930s there was a distinct lack of industrial development. There were few manufacturing industries and no sources of long-term credit for industry. The funds available for investment were generally channelled through the London stock market. The ICC Bank was established to provide a means of redirecting this finance to create an industrial base in Ireland, initially by underwriting capital issues and providing medium and long-term capital for Irish manufacturing businesses. Its main objective is to provide a range of financial services for the business sectors of the economy while seeking to earn a satisfactory return on shareholders' funds. ICC Bank differs from the commercial banks in that its services are directed solely towards the business community, particularly small and medium sized enterprises. That the bank has shown a profit in each of the 66 years since it was established in 1933 reflects well upon its management and the <Col N="1162" /> responsible decision-making attitude adopted by staff.</P>
    <P>This Bill will allow the Department of Finance to inject up to £15 million into ICC Bank and will enable the bank to be sold in the future. The failure of the previous bid to sell the bank resulted from a lack of preparation. The period prior to the sale was not properly handled and mistakes were made. Although we will see many semi-State companies being sold in the future, the process was new to many this time last year. This legislation should have been introduced prior to the previous attempt to sell the ICC in 1999. Had the proper preparation been made last year, there is no doubt that the company would have been a more attractive prospect for potential investors.</P>
    <P>The bank's performance over the past year will make it even more attractive to investors at this stage. Irish companies, because of their size, lack a critical mass and require international partners. That is true of Aer Lingus and the former Telecom Éireann. Over the years, Kerry Group, with which I am well acquainted, expanded outside of Ireland because it was not possible to expand within the Irish market. I hope the bank will attract the interest of a strong international bank or consortium which has a worldwide established customer base. That may be a rather ambitious wish but, given the bank's expertise and record it will be an attractive prospect for an international buy-out. The bank may, on the other hand, be bought by the Bank of Ireland or some other Irish company. It is interesting to note that the recent bids for Eircom come from two Irish entrepreneurs. Mr. Denis O'Brien has indicated his desire to buy Eircom and it now appears that Mr. Tony O'Reilly is also interested in the company. There are Irish entrepreneurs and companies which have the strength and confidence to bid for banks such as the ICC.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Quinn made a very good presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service some weeks ago on the up-to-date ICC position. He stated that this legislation would allow the bank to concentrate on the options available to it such as the possibility of a trade sale or a strategic alliance in the future.</P>
    <P>ICC is currently allowed to lend approximately double its amount of authorised share capital. The injection of funds which will result from the passing of this legislation will allow it to lend on £80 million. That is a positive move and one which will place the bank in a much stronger position when it is put on the market. The ICC has continued to expand and its performance has continued to improve since 1999. In the six months to the end of April, profits were up 64% and the interim pre-tax profits of £18 million will allow the bank to increase lending by an additional £15 million to £20 million after tax and dividends.</P>
    <P>The sharp rise in income generated in ICC Bank is one of the main causes in the substantial decline in its cost to income ratio from 47.1% to 35.8% over the six month period. The bank, <Col N="1163" /> whose income levels have increased at a much faster rate than its costs have reduced, is working to achieve greater efficiency from its existing cost base. A potential buyer will view positively the scale of the reduction in the cost to income ratio and it will be important for the bank to maintain its current levels over the remainder of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The bank has increased its presence in the service industry sector and has also been active in funding projects in the area of renewable energy sources. The ICC is involved in the provision of seed capital to wind-farming enterprises. To digress for a moment, I saw a number of turbines being erected on the Stacks Mountains and in other parts of County Kerry. In future, we must consider the value of wind farming from the point of view of reducing greenhouse gas emissions but we must also consider its effect on our landscape. Turbines should not be erected in very scenic areas. Wind farming is a relatively new departure and, as such, local authorities may not be very <i>au fait </i>with them. I have seen a number of applications coming before Kerry County Council in this regard and have seen turbines being erected in areas in which they damage the landscape.</P>
    <P>A book entitled <i>Credit Where Credit is Due </i>offers a valuable insight into the ICC's history. It states that in the ten years to October 1999, ICC's dividends and tax charge amounted to more than £60 million, a worthwhile contribution to the Exchequer. It further states that the growth of ICC's business during the 1990s is evidenced by the fact that its assets, which stood at slightly more than £1 billion in 1990, increased to almost £2.5 billion by 31 October 1999. That is a reflection on how well the ICC has performed over that period.</P>
    <P>Deputies Connaughton, Burke and others referred to the role of the ICC after it has been sold. We are relatively new to the idea of venture capital, which has driven Silicon Valley and various developments in America, and have not sufficiently capitalised on its potential. We must create more of a venture capital culture, particularly in terms of remote and peripheral areas where it is very difficult to get local business to invest because of the economic base. It is important in terms of creating jobs in areas where it is difficult for the IDA to get mobile investment. In future the ICC will have to play a more significant role in terms of venture capital.</P>
    <P>There are some financial experts in the House, but in general we perceive the ICC as a lending agency which helped set up small businesses in our localities and which we approached in terms of trying to help clients. We cannot predict with certainty what will happen in future in the event of a partner being found for ICC or of it being sold. There is a concern that the important role being fulfilled by the bank, which is not being provided by any other commercial bank, should continue. Deputy Kelleher made the very good point that in future, whatever the circumstances <Col N="1164" /> in which ICC will operate, these critical roles of providing seed and venture capital, etc., must be continued. It would be a major strength if ICC could attract a partner which had major connections in terms of venture capital.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply will expand upon the role of ICC in future in terms of its current focus. Will there be control in this regard or will the contribution of ICC since 1933 be diluted if it becomes part of an international organisation?</P>
    <P>This is a very important debate for those of us trying to attract industry to our localities and who have connections in America, including Silicon Valley. Everyday we come up against problems in trying to lure and attract investors into remote places. One of the future means of attracting industry and getting investment is through venture capital, and I see a very important, strengthened and expanded role for ICC in this area, apart from its role in e-commerce and the other areas in which it is currently venturing. Perhaps in his reply the Minister could give us an overview of this aspect of ICC's role.</P>
    <P>The strategy and vision of ICC was ably described by Deputy Quinn. Even if left on its own ICC will prosper in future because of its management and focus. We all agree that ICC should be sold &ndash; Fine Gael was perhaps the first party to suggest it. The idea was mooted in 1992, but there was an amount of opposition. We must be careful that the critical role played by ICC will in no way be diluted in future and that its significance in supporting so many of our SMEs will not be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share time with Deputy Timmins.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's speech and am somewhat confused as to why this Bill is being brought forward at this stage, particularly given there is no indication as to whom the bank will be sold. We know the staff and management will secure a 14.9% stake in ICC, which I very much welcome. I note this is being done by way of 5% in return for change in the bank while 9.9% is being purchased. The performance of ICC over rercent years has resulted from good management and good staff. I have always been a fan of ESOPs and have supported the idea that staff, who create the wealth, deserve a stake in the company. I have no objections to the concept of the State surrendering 5% of its share and giving the staff the opportunity to purchase 9.9 %.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that we provide the opportunity for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank. The bank is continuing to grow strongly and as long as it remains in public ownership the shareholder must provide the necessary share capital. The bank is performing a very important function in being to the forefront in providing venture capital, which is important for our type of economy and particularly for small and medium sized businesses which would per<Col N="1165" /> haps find it more difficult to get such capital from ICC's competitors. However, the Minister does not say who will replace the ICC in the provision of venture capital.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not at a stage where it is self sufficient in terms of providing capital. Small and medium businesses still have to borrow money to expand and create employment. The way things are going, with everything becoming so big, there is no competition. There are two major banks and a couple of small banks, and it could be said that we will have one bank if we are to take an extreme viewpoint. Where is the competition? Government has a responsibility not only to achieve success for its shareholders, namely the people, but to ensure there is ongoing competition so people can get the capital necessary for development, particularly outside the major cities, which are choking.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has achieved something by getting a commitment that the Minister would bring forward a motion for approval by the House before he sells any further shares. That can be done in bits and pieces. On the overall structure of the company, where it will be in five years' time, who will replace the type of business that it is concentrating on and which has grown enormously in the past ten years, as outlined by the Minister? Do we have a guarantee of onward competition in the banking industry so that people can get the capital needed to either expand an existing business or to create a new one? Let us look at what happened in the insurance industry, of which I know a little. A short time ago if one wanted a quotation for motor or house insurance there were numerous companies one could approach and get the best quotation. Every day of the week small insurance companies are bought over by large companies and there is less competition. I am interested in competition. Good competition is healthy whether in the banking or insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is happening since Ireland joined the euro, a matter I raised at the Joint Committee on European Affairs when the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Banking Federation representatives appeared before the committee. Let us look at those changing Irish punts into pesetas or Austrian schillings as I did last week when I was travelling with the Ceann Comhairle. To illustrate what is happening I have two dockets here showing that for £100 worth of Austrian schillings I was charged a fee of 2.25% plus £2.50. We are supposed to be in the euro. Yet we have to pay 2.25% plus £2.50 to get Austrian schillings. We wonder why people are losing confidence in the euro We were told the only advantage of the euro would be that if all the countries joined and if you wished to take your money around the European Union you would not lose your money. On a small transaction the charge was 2.25% plus £2.50. The charge in the other docket is exactly the same.</P>
    <P>I have some other statistics. Irish banks are charging the highest in Europe to change money <Col N="1166" /> within the euro zone. The reason for this is the lack of competition. If the two major banks here decided to close up shop tomorrow morning in some aspect of business, whether in property or whatever, there would be no competition. I do not have any ideological problems about selling off State assets. If it is good for the Irish people I will put up my hand and say I am in favour of it. As one who has been in business all my life I do not understanding the reason for selling assets that are continuing to grow and produce major profits. For what do we want to sell an asset? What will be done with the money? This is a bank that is providing a service particularly in the area of venture capital and competition, even though it may be small. I do not want to see what happened in the insurance industry taking place in the banking industry. Long established companies have gone out of existence. They have been bought out by large continental companies. This is fine in itself but is it good for the Irish consumer? Are we getting to a stage where if one wants to insure one's car one can approach two or three companies and they can set the rates? That is what happens when people are allowed buy up many smaller companies because there is no competition.</P>
    <P>This is not about having an ideological problem about the sale of ICC but about knowing exactly where we are going with this company. We should learn from Eircom. It was floated off. Some percentages were sold to foreign telecoms, the public was asked to invest, and the State owns a part of it but the share price has gone to the floor. Thousands of people turned up at the recent AGM of the company. There is no long-term proposal as to how this company should develop. Will it be sold off completely? Will the State continue to be a part owner? This is all about confidence in a particular company. We should learn a lesson from that.</P>
    <P>If we want to do something with ICC why can we not sell some of the shares to the ordinary person on the street but restrict the amounts one can purchase? It is fine to get staff and management involved. I understand that some 2% of ICC is owned privately. Why can we not decide to give the people a chance to invest in a successful bank? Nobody has explained why that cannot be done. If we are to pass legislation which authorises the Government to sell off a successful asset a proper plan should be debated in the House because we are here representing the ordinary shareholder. We are here as the people's voice in respect of an asset they hold. People will say a good price can be got for this bank today. That is fine, the money will go into the State coffers. Perhaps it can be used to further eliminate the debt and maybe that is the right thing to do but that is a decision that should be taken. What is the alternative? Where will this bank be in five or ten years' time if left as it is? If some of the shares were sold to the staff and management where do the professionals say the bank is likely <Col N="1167" /> to be? Will it be weakened and unable to compete?</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is happening to interest rates. Many people who have a pension lump sum want to leave their money on deposit for the rainy day but the deposit interest rate offered by the major banks is outrageous while some of the smaller banks offer 2 percentage points higher than the major banks. It is good that these banks are here and will look for money. Because of the type of business in which they are engaged they are prepared to offer a higher rate than the major banks.</P>
    <P>I will not vote against the legislation because of my party's position on this matter. However, I still believe, before any motion is brought before this House for the sell off of any shares in this company, we should get a professional report outlining clearly to us as legislators what in their opinion is the likely future of this bank if no change takes place other than selling off some of the shares to staff and management, about which I have no problem. That is the right approach. When it comes to Committee Stage the Minister should frame an amendment to put into legislation certain commitments about a detailed report and so on. Perhaps this is unusual in legislation but it is unusual to sell off a very successful State asset that is growing and continuing to grow and, above all, is providing competition and venture capital which may not be available from the other banks. Because of its unique position and the manner in which it has grown over the past ten years, we deserve something better than just passing legislation which will allow any future Government to decide the matter. The House should receive a comprehensive report as to what the professionals think the future of the bank will be under options, one, two, three and four.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for sharing his time with me. I do not disagree with the principle of selling State assets, but I have concerns about competition. Will we look back in a few years and saying &ldquo;Hey, we shouldn't have let this go&ldquo;? We are all familiar with the phrase &ldquo;the country is awash with money and there is loads of money for every project&rdquo;. All the politicians use that phrase which one hears on every radio programme. To use an old adage, it might be better to teach people how to fish instead of giving them fish. Much money is thrown at various projects whose viability I would question. Is this the correct approach to take? As sure as night follows day, there will be a time of want. In a few years time we will look back at various tranches of funding that were given to certain schemes and projects that should not have been given. For the sake of political expediency or an easy life, however, such funds are being allocated as a short-term solution, rather than addressing the causes of dissatisfaction. While it is almost certain that the ICC Bank will be sold, I would not like <Col N="1168" /> to see the money raised by its sale going towards short-term solutions.</P>
      <P>Irish banks are highly profitable and that fact reflects the general state of the economy. The banking sector is undergoing change and the main driving forces for such change are globalisation and deregulation. It is hard to persuade people to switch from their bank or insurance company. People are reluctant to switch and they do not shop around. They get their insurance renewal forms in the post, but rather than ringing around for a lower premium, they will simply renew them. I am sure Deputy Barrett is glad that is the case in some instances, but it is important to shop around. I hope the globalisation of banking will assist competition. Advances in information technology have played a big part in the evolution of the banking system.</P>
      <P>The Bill is preparing ICC for sale and this situation is inevitable in many respects as many banking and other business groups strive to rationalise their costs. I welcome the ESOP principle which will have to evolve though many facets of life, particularly when people seek higher wages or more time off. We should examine the principle in various strands of the Civil Service where it is difficult to recruit people to fill vacancies. Public sector employees feel they are being left behind the private sector, but the ESOP principle will make staff in semi-State companies feel they are part of something and, in addition, it will maintain restraints on wages.</P>
      <P>Banks are an easy target on which all of us can vent our anger. While one is always careful not to attack anyone or anything without good reason, one can have a go at banks without fear of running into difficulties. Part of the reason for this is that banks have abused their position over many years. In the past, most people entered banks in terror and with a subservient attitude. The banks had a position similar to that of the church or the legal profession. Customers felt the bank manager was doing them a big favour if he granted a loan or other facility, when in fact the customer was keeping the manager in business. Luckily enough, that wall has crumbled with the evolution of society. Banks now realise they must also evolve. Many branches of big banks have made contributions in areas, for example, through sponsorship of local events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 the banks spent £1.8 billion in the economy, and they provide more than 30,000 jobs. An important function is to facilitate the interaction between those with surplus funds and those seeking funds. The ICC has played an important role in facilitating small business investors. I admire those who take a chance in the business world. It is easy to flash by a place and say &ldquo;God, such and such a business is going very well. He is making great money&rdquo;. However, a person must put his neck on the line to enter the business arena. Business has received a bad press from politicians in recent years. I do not know how many times I have heard people say that big business and politics should not mix. However, innovative business <Col N="1169" /> is the life-blood of the economy in contributing taxes and creating employment. It is important to realise that without such business enterprise we would not have the economy as it is. People, therefore, should stand up for the business sector and applaud the fact that business people are willing to put their necks on the line and take a chance.</P>
    <P>Banking commenced in Ireland in the 1600s, with the branch concept arriving in the 1820s. Traditionally, while people were subservient to the banks, they placed great trust in them and did not see them as doing anything wrong. Phrases such as &ldquo;Safe as the Bank of England&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Safe as a bank&rdquo;, were commonly used.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the banks' approach towards lending money for house purchases. Every other day people receive letters in the post asking them to sign on the dotted line to obtain £10,000. One hardly has to put one's address on the application form. Money is being given out too cheaply, however, and someone will have to pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I have received anecdotal evidence about the repossession of cars. Last weekend, someone told me to go to a certain garage to see how the owner is having difficulty in parking the vehicles that have been repossessed. Each January and February we see young people with mobile phones flashing around in newly registered cars that cost at least £10,000 or £12,000 each. The main banks should publicly state what the position is concerning the repossession of cars so that others can be warned. Are the figures higher than before and are people running into difficulties? Many people think there is no payback because money is so easy to come by, everyone is having a good time and we are all on a tidal wave.</P>
    <P>In the recent past, I raised with the Minister the question of bank drafts. Elderly people in rural areas have traditionally put their money in a shoe box under the bed. Those who were a bit more advanced, however, took out a banker's draft. I have the impression that many people took out banker's drafts as a form of keeping money safely, but they may have passed away and so the draft has not been drawn down. Banks have a record of such transactions. My understanding is that if someone dies without making a will, the person seeking probate contacts the banking institutions, but does not check all the banking records, only current and deposit accounts. I am confident a great deal of money is lying in banks which has not been drawn down by people or by their next of kin. There is an onus on the banks, particularly the two main banks, to go thorough their banker's draft records and try to contact the next of kin concerned. I hope the Minister's officials will convey this to the Minister. I have mentioned this matter in the past but, since the Minister is a busy man, I do not think the point I am making has hit home. In addition, people who have illegal money have used this system. We hear anecdotal evidence of what is <Col N="1170" /> happening but I do not intend to go into that. It is important for us to examine this matter and introduce legislation requiring banks to inform draft holders after a certain period that there is a time limit on the draft. Hundreds of vulnerable, poor people do not have access to money which is rightfully due to them as the next of kin, because the banks have held on to it.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned tax clearance certificates. If a local builder places a tender for an extension to a council house, he must have a tax clearance certificate. If one of the major banks is to purchase the ICC, it is important that it be required to produce a tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State about the concept of the banker's draft. It is something which should be examined in conjunction with dormant accounts.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I will explain exactly what the Government is about in introducing the Bill. The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of ICC Bank from £40 million to £80 million. That is all very well, but the real reason for the Bill is in section 4 which states that the Minister may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all the shares held by him in the ICC. The privatisation of ICC Bank is what the Government is about and is the real reason the Bill is being brought before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Government wishes to hand over to financial moguls, be they Irish based or internationally based, yet another asset which properly belongs to the people. Privatisation mania dominates the thinking and actions of the Government on an almost weekly basis. What we have is a Government that is drunk on current growth rates in the economy and which is intoxicated with the philosophy of free-booting, free market capitalism and the greed for the purchase of State assets by powerful interests who want to lay their hands on them. The Government is greedy for the funds brought in in the short-term by privatisation and sell offs.</P>
      <P>The Government now has a tunnel vision as far as our State assets are concerned. No more is it a question of developing assets and companies in State ownership and the services State owned companies can give the people, rather how a quick buck can be turned by the sale of these invaluable assets and handing them over to the Government's friends in private enterprise, the people who fund the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This philosophy, this privatisation mania, will <Col N="1171" /> have disastrous consequences in this State in years ahead. It removes increasing amounts of control from the people in the imperfect form of State-owned companies and places those companies in the hands of those who feel no responsibility for the well-being of the people, for social solidarity or for the concepts of full employment and social harmony for working class people, working people and marginalised people. Privatisation is about giving control to private capitalists based here or in the form of multi-national companies. In doing so, the Government is also throwing the fate of thousands of employees at the mercy of those who buy up State assets and who do not have a commitment to maintaining the full complement of those employees into the indefinite future.</P>
    <P>The privatisation decisions of the Government, the philosophy which underlines them and the decisions made accordingly by the Government are based on the economic record of recent years and the extraordinarily high growth rates which have obtained in this economy. The Government's head has been turned by this experience to the extent that it now believes this level of growth or thereabouts can continue into the indefinite future. That means the Government is moving into cloud cuckoo land as far as the economic future of the State is concerned. The Government has forgotten or, probably more correctly, does not understand in the first place the iron laws of economic development within the capitalist system. Growth moves in cycles. Integral to capitalism are cycles of growth and recession, of boom and slump. As sure as night follows day, unfortunately, slump follows boom. When an economic recession develops, which is, unfortunately, inevitable in the years ahead, privatisations effected in the conditions of boom will be seen to have devastating consequences.</P>
    <P>What is privatisation? We have a Government which tries to fool the people about the real meaning of privatisation. It tried to con the people in the Telecom Éireann privatisation affair, a pretence that this was a move to people's capitalism, to giving the people some kind of real say in an important asset such as the telecommunications infrastructure. It abused and misused our heritage by playing a folk song called Dúlamán Gaelach on the television every night when trying to convince the people that they should gamble their hard earned money and scarce resources on Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Since then, the real face of privatisation, even in the conditions of boom, have revealed their ugly reality &ndash; naked greed by senior management to grab what could be grabbed and a grab by big business to get its hands on the assets which should have properly remained the responsibility and in the ownership of the people. Now we have the billionaire, Mr. O'Reilly, vying with the multi-millionaire, Mr. O'Brien, to lay hands on the fixed line section of Eircom. It is a vindication of the view I expressed at the time of <Col N="1172" /> the Telecom Éireann privatisation that people's capitalism is nothing but a pretence, a short conduit of these crucial State assets from the hands of ordinary people into the hands of the real intended target of big business ownership. That will also be the fate of ICC Bank if the Government gets its way.</P>
    <P>When ICC Bank is privatised, it will be in the marketplace and will be like an unfortunate mouse torn between the various big cats in the granary. It will be a question of which paw is the largest in getting this profitable resource which now belongs to the people. We will have a large bank and possibly an internationally based bank but it does not matter even if it is a home based bank. The criteria for these banks is simply the bottom line of the maximisation of their profit at whatever cost. Will there be a commitment in private ownership to maintaining employment as a priority within ICC Bank? Will there be a commitment to the small business person and the self-employed person who the ICC helped when other banks would not look at them for extending loans or security for small business ventures or enterprises they wished to set up?</P>
    <P>In the context of economic growth, the major banks are falling over themselves to give loans left, right and centre to anyone who will darken their doorways, small business people and self-employed people included. The profit rates and the mass of profit are sufficiently attractive for them to do that and even to take a few chances because they know they will gain massively. However, that will change dramatically in different economic conditions. We will then see the real face of the big banks once again. They will be as ruthless in closing down the small people as the multi-national companies were in this State during the recessionary conditions in the 1970s and 1980s, when they ruthlessly retrenched, let thousands of workers go and moved to where they could make greater profits.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic to see Fine Gael Deputies and Fianna Fáil backbenchers praising the past role of ICC Bank. They then go on to wail about the uncertainty that might follow privatisation, and whether the banks that will acquire ICC will take a different approach to the small, self-employed person. The Fine Gael Deputies are following the Government like lemmings over the cliff of privatisation on this issue. They are betraying the small people.</P>
    <P>At the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business I heard Fine Gael Deputies and Fianna Fáil backbenchers make loud noises when there was talk of removing the ban on supermarket chains engaging in below cost selling. They rightly pointed out this would undermine small shopkeepers and that when those small people were wiped out, the prices would be ruthlessly jacked up again by the big supermarket conglomerates that had wiped them out because they now controlled the market. Those same Deputies are now voting for the privatisation of ICC, which is the equivalent of what would happen in the <Col N="1173" /> supermarket wars if they were allowed have their way. We have a sense of what that will mean.</P>
    <P>I have also heard Deputies today decry the social irresponsibility of the major banks in closing down branches in small towns in rural Ireland because, apparently, they were not making sufficient profits. In some cases, it was not the case that they were not making any profits but that their profits were not big enough to justify the branches staying open, so they moved to bigger centres of development and left the people of rural Ireland high and dry. Deputies are decrying that, quite correctly, but then went on to support placing in the hands of those very same big banks, what is now a very valuable State owned asset, which adopted a far friendlier approach to the small people struggling to make ends meet or to survive in this country's economic life.</P>
    <P>To justify privatisation, we have been given examples in the past of public ownership where there were inefficiencies and money was being lost. However, ICC is quite different. Last year, it made £25 million in profits. In the first six months of this year, it made £18 million in profits. It is a very successful State owned enterprise, which could be a part model for how the banking system could work here. However, the Government is proposing to hand it over to the ruthless concerns that control the big banks.</P>
    <P>We have the usual ESOP, which is an attempt to buy the support of the work force and trade unions through granting some of the shares to the work force in return for agreeing to privatisation and many other concessions. Unfortunately, the trade union leadership has long since sold the pass on the question of privatisation. It has swallowed the propaganda that market capitalism cannot be challenged. Trade union leaders now sit down with the bosses and the Government in all these so-called partnership bodies and meekly go along with handing over to multi-nationals and big business State assets that up to several years ago they would have relentlessly defended. That is a shameful and sad development within the trade union movement which will be deeply regretted in the years to come, when the real effects of privatisation are seen in different economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I stand for the real involvement of workers in semi-State companies. I deplore the bureaucratic mismanagement and resultant inefficiencies that obtained in State owned and semi-State companies in the past. I want real involvement and real democratic structures within the State owned sector, where workers have a real say and real involvement, as should the customers of the banks. That is the alternative to this sop of an ESOP arrangement, by which some shares are given to the workers. I remind the leadership of the trade union movement that it has a responsibility to the working class people as a whole, who will suffer when the effects of privatisation are really felt in a future economic recession.</P>
    <P>Céim eile náireach atá san mBille seo, an Bille um Banc ICC, 2000. An bun-chúis atá leis an <Col N="1174" /> mBille seo, an chaipitil agus na scaireanna ceadaithe a mhéadú ó £40 milliún go £80 milliún. Faightear an chuid is tábhachtaí den mBille in alt 4, a cheadaíonn don Rialtas an banc a dhíol. Príobháideadh Bhanc ICC atá i gceist ag an Rialtas agus is é seo, i ndáiríre, príomhfháth an Bhille seo agus an príomhchuspóir atá ag an Rialtas i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Tá príobháideadh achmhainní poiblí agus comhluchtaí Stáit mar fhealsúnacht thar aon fhealsúnacht eile ag an Rialtas i láthair na huaire. Teastaíonn ón Rialtas go mbeadh gach achmhainn phoiblí agus gach comhlucht Stáit díolta leis na boic mhóra i gcóras an chaipitleachais, faoi mar atá. Dheineadar amhlaidh le Telecom Éireann agus teastaíonn uathu an rud céana a dhéanamh le hAer Lingus. Feicimid cad a tharla i gcás Telecom Éireann, nó Eircom mar atá an comhlucht ainmnithe anois. Tháinig saint agus ocras saibhris chun tosaigh, rinne na boic mhóra airgead mór ach chaill na daoine beaga. Is mar sin a bhíonn i gcónaí agus is mar sin a bheidh, ó thaobh phríobháideadh achmhainní Stáit. Ní dos na daoine beaga a dhéantar an príobháideadh ach dos na boic mhóra agus dóibh siúd a thugann airgead mór d'Fhianna Fáil agus don Phairtí Daonlathach agus d'Fhine Gael, chomh maith. Ansan tugann an Rialtas cinneadh i dtaobh comhlucht mar ICC atá fábharach dos na boic mhóra a dteastaíonn uathu a lámha a chur ar an achmhainn thábhachtach seo.</P>
    <P>Thug Banc ICC seirbhís do dhaoine féin-fhostaithe agus do lucht beag gnó. Fuair daoine seirbhís agus cabhair ó ICC nach dtabharfadh na bainc mhóra dóibh, go háirithe nuair nach raibh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta sláintiúil sa tír. Anois, tá Rialtas againn atá ar meisce leis an bhfás i gcursaí eacnamaíochta agus ceapann lucht an Rialtais go leanfaidh an fás ar aghaidh go síoraí. Ní leanfaidh, faraor. Tagann teip i ndiaidh an fháis i gcónaí, agus sin a tharlóidh. Is oth liom a rá gurb iad na daoine beaga agus an lucht oibre a bheidh thíos le fealsúnacht an phríobháideachais atá á chur chun cinn ag an Rialtas. Mo náire an Rialtas agus mo náire Fine Gael atá ag tabhairt tacaíochta dó.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. I do not wish to devote too much time to my good friend and colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, who has expounded the benefits of socialism. He rounded on Fianna Fáil and, naturally, I agree with that. I am not so sure I agree with him as regards Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the other organisations, including the trade union movement. It is difficult to be in a position where everyone else is wrong and I do not wish to go too deeply into the concept put forward by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Times change and we must change with them. Market forces, consumer demands and public demands change. I remind the Deputy of the sixties, an era in which we were all politically aware. In the UK and here as soon as a difficulty arose every ailing company was nationalised. That was <Col N="1175" /> the panacea for everything. We would have utopia. Alas, nothing could have been further from the truth. Even monopolies, be they national or international, must face competition. Unless they are protected from competition they cannot survive and they did not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It nationalised the motor industry which was the backbone of the British economy at the time. Every car here and in the UK was manufactured in Britain. What happened in the meantime? With nationalisation it all fell apart to such an extent that the effects are still felt in the UK and it is incapable of effectively working the market to its advantage. The Ford and Japanese motor companies that have huge investment there have indicated they are pulling out. There is a serious flaw in Deputy Higgins' argument. I do not wish to encourage invective but I would be delighted to discuss that concept at greater length. However, extremes in either direction are dangerous. There is a balance in the middle. If we can achieve that and have privatisation with competition the consumer will benefit.</P>
      <P>I regard myself as a kind of DIY expert. Some time ago I had occasion to buy plumbing materials. The last time I did that was probably 30 years ago. There is a big difference in the cost of them now and then. Going on Deputy Higgins' analogy he would say they are more expensive now but they are not. They are less expensive and that is because tariffs and barriers have been removed. Restrictive practices have been removed and market forces have been allowed to develop. Those who supply goods and services are not impeded. The EU tried to free up the market and remove obstacles. Remember how we were under the protected market Deputy Higgins espouses. We were in the shadow of a bigger, more powerful nation. At all times our trade agreements were of greater benefit to it than to us. In that restricted and controlled marketplace the smaller operator cannot win. It is right that Members pay tribute to the work of the ICC and other smaller banks over the years. They had a niche market and provided for it in a way that other greater, more powerful agencies did not. That is important. I hope that, in the future, regardless of what happens such markets are covered. I could quote chapter and verse on countless small banking groups that helped out numerous people when larger institutions would not listen to their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when industrial investment and the creation of jobs was sought after as a matter of urgency ICC met the people and understood their problems and concerns. It reacted accordingly and, as a result, was able to put in place the supports necessary in an economy such as ours. Other economies that benefited from the industrial revolution were much more sophisticated in <Col N="1176" /> terms of marketing and economies of scale. With the limited size of our economy we would have been at a distinct disadvantage were it not for the activities of those smaller institutions.</P>
    <P>I compliment not only ICC but TSB and the other smaller banks which provided a range of services that had a social as well as an economic content. When I was much younger I recall that we did not have an amalgamation of the various banking groups but a series of banks. I presume it was of some benefit to amalgamate them but there were also dangers to competition.</P>
    <P>In order to support the free market it is essential to have access to it and that is given by way of financial support. Denial of access to the financial resources necessary to provide for industry, big or small, is a crucial factor. The massive multinational investment we have at present would not have happened if there were not access to financial resources and if the multinational corporations had not confidence in this economy and in the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to have a longer time to discuss these issues with Deputy Higgins. By no stretch of the imagination are matters as simplistic as he suggests. It would be beneficial to have a debate on these issues from time to time and recall matters we may have forgotten or flaws that have shown up over the years and consider how best to contribute to their improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the impact of inflation on people dependent on social welfare payments. The budget last December provided for a £7 per week increase for pensioners over 66 years, a special increase of £5.90 per week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66 years. The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9% while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government took office social welfare payments have been substantially increased in real terms. For example, social welfare pensioners aged 66 years and over have received total increases of between 23% and 27% compared with an increase of 11.2% in the cost of living <Col N="1177" /> during the same period. It is also clear that for many social welfare recipients and their families the overall rate of increase in payment this year will be ahead of the increase in the cost of living. Pensioners who received the £7 increase are well ahead of inflation. In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances were provided this year, ranging from 8% to 17%. The budget also provided for significant increases of between 22% and 23% in monthly child benefit payments.</P>
    <P>The implementation dates for social welfare increases have been brought forward by six weeks, four of which were this year. Furthermore, as part of our commitment to align the tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all increases will take place at the start of the tax year from April next. This progressively earlier payment of increases has to be taken into account in assessing the real level of increases which have been provided by this Government over its period of office.</P>
    <P>The higher than expected inflation has had the effect of reducing the real value of this year's budget increases in social welfare payments. However, in the budget for next year the Government will take full account of the increased level of inflation in setting increases for 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the Minister's proposed compensation package turned down by the Cabinet if the Government is concerned about the effect of inflation on social welfare recipients? Thousands of people are dependent on these allowances and the real benefits have been ravaged by inflation. Real standard of living has declined rather than improved because of inflation and because the increases were based on a lower inflation rate. What steps will the Minister take to compensate for what has happened to social welfare recipients over the past year?

      <P>In its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government set itself the target of increasing social welfare in real values. This is carried on into the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which promises that all social welfare recipients will experience a real increase. Over the past three budgets &ndash; even taking into account that people under 65 years of age are, in effect, in a static position &ndash; they have received a real increase. The figures prove they have received an increase way in excess of anything given by any previous Government.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to Deputies the Government's concern about the impact of the higher than expected inflation on people dependent on social welfare payments and that the forthcoming budget will take full account of this in setting social welfare increases for 2001.</P>
      <P>However, it would not be possible to bring the payment dates for social welfare increases forward to January 2001 as a way of compensating for the rise in inflation. A lead in time of a number of months is needed to make the required legislative and administrative changes necessary to implement the social welfare improvements announced in the budget. This includes the enactment of the necessary social welfare legislation, the printing of pension books and so forth. Given that the budget will only be announced on 6 December, there would not be sufficient time to implement social welfare changes from the beginning of January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of our commitment to align the tax and social welfare changes by 2001 we have already brought forward the implementation dates for social welfare increases by six weeks, four of which were this year. In addition, I recently announced that the alignment of tax and social welfare changes will be maintained when the tax <Col N="1179" /> year is changed to coincide with the calendar year in January 2002.</P>
    <P>This will mean the increased social welfare weekly rates will be paid a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office. Then they were paid in the first week of June. In 2002 they will be paid on 1 January. Even the Opposition would accept that this is some achievement.</P>

      <P>In relation to the issue of linking old age pensions to gross average industrial earnings, the facts speak for themselves. In 1995 there was an increase of &ndash; 0.7%, in other words a net decrease. When we came into office in 1998 we gave an increase in our first budget of 2.21% over average industrial earnings for contributory pensions; for non-contributory pensions the increase was even greater. That has been the case in the successive years 1999 and 2000. The increases for old age pensioners have been above gross average industrial earnings &ndash; in relation to contributory pensions, 1.20% and in relation to non-contributory pensions, 2.27%.

Clearly people on social welfare have fallen dramatically behind. Given that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, got the inflation rate for 2000 so badly wrong, being out by 3 to 4%, what is his prediction for next year and, therefore, how much will the increases be, given that various groups are asking for a minimum basic increase of £14 across the range of payments, and a minimum payment of £90 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The one-parent family payment under the social welfare system acts as a safety net for people where there is inadequate or no maintenance. To that extent, my Department is dealing with liable relatives who are already reluctant or unable to provide support even at the direct request of their families. This is the experience of all countries with similar systems in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants for one-parent family payment are required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouse or, in the case of unmarried applicants, the parent <Col N="1183" /> of their child. Normally, such maintenance is obtained by way of informal negotiation or by court order under family law, though separated couples are increasingly using the Family Mediation Service which has been progressively extended nation-wide by this Government since it came into office.</P>
    <P>Maintenance payments, where they are being made, are assessable as means in determining entitlement to one-parent family payment. Independent research has shown that only 12% of the family law maintenance orders are honoured regularly. Therefore, where there is inadequate or no maintenance, the social welfare system guarantees the lone parent a regular weekly income.</P>
    <P>The staff dealing with one-parent family payment claims also deal with the enforcement of the requirement to seek maintenance. This process is backed by social welfare inspectors throughout the country. In addition, a separate unit has been set up to operate the system of direct recovery of contributions from the parents concerned. There are currently seven staff in this unit.</P>
    <P>In implementing the maintenance recovery provisions, the Department has concentrated on those cases where the &ldquo;liable relatives&rdquo; concerned, being in employment or self-employment, appear to be in a better financial position to make a contribution towards the relevant benefit or allowance being paid by the Department to their families. More than £3.6 million has been collected through direct contributions from some 545 liable relatives to date through the maintenance recovery system.</P>
    <P>In addition to direct contributions from liable relatives, the maintenance recovery operation has resulted in scheme savings of more than £2 million. A further sum, estimated at £2.7 million per annum, is saved from the assessment of maintenance in payment directly to lone parents at the time they make their claims.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The review of the one-parent family payment was published in September 2000. The main focus of the review was the extent to which the scheme achieves its objectives having regard to the needs of lone parents and their children and the desire to avoid long-tern dependency on social welfare.</P>
    <P>On the issue of maintenance, the review set out a very comprehensive analysis of the options in the maintenance area. This included recommendations that the system should be enforced more vigorously while bearing in mind value for money considerations. The implications of this recommendation are under active consideration at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously a difficult area in which to develop policy. Would the Minister accept that a major review of policy is necessary in this area? In relation to the number of staff dealing with this in the Department, I understand <Col N="1184" /> that seven people are directly involved in recovering maintenance. Does the Minister consider that adequate to deal with this issue? The statistics seem to suggest that 70 to 80% of parents who ought to pay maintenance do not pay, and only 12% of court orders are honoured regularly, which is extraordinary. What does the Minister believe he can do to create a culture where maintenance is part and parcel of the way we operate in relation, for example, not just to the allowance we are discussing but in general? Does the Minister believe the Department should run campaigns on this issue? There has been very little public discussion of this. Does the Minister accept that more public discussion is needed in terms of the obligations and responsibilities of both parents, given the very low levels of compliance with court orders? Is it acceptable that the burden of pursuing the maintenance should be on one parent, in most cases, the woman, or does the Minister feel his Department could play a stronger role? Is it right that this should be pursued through the judicial system rather than through mediation, which I think is a better way to pursue it? As we develop the family mediation service, I hope that can be used more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the Deputy's comments. The staff of seven are dedicated to recovering moneys. All the staff, of which there are many, who deal with the scheme of one parent family payments, have an obligation to ensure maintenance is properly paid, as it is taxpayer's money. One only need consider the approach adopted by the child support agency in the UK. It adopted an extremely heavy-handed approach, which was more severe than that required. The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised this matter in the context of putting in place better procedures in the Department. I launched the review of the one parent family payment recently, which dealt with a number of options we could examine. Hard and fast recommendations were not made. Ultimately this matter will be up to me as Minister and the planning unit in my Department, but it is an area in which I accept more can be done. Up to recently, mainly because of the economic circumstances that then prevailed, the area could be divided into one third of parents who disappear, one third who are in receipt of social welfare payments, whom there is no point pursuing as they are in receipt of a basic payment and a cohort of one third of parents whom the Department pursues. I accept what the Deputy says regarding maintenance. Our system is one of pursuing the parents concerned through the courts, which can be a frustrating experience. Over the years the Department has adopted a more easy attitude that is less onerous on the person making the payment.</P>

      <P>Following agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. Given its multi-dimensional nature, poverty cannot be solely the concern of one Department. Each Government Department has a responsibility and an obligation to ensure that its policy proposals are poverty proofed.</P>
      <P>To assist in the implementation of poverty proofing, the national anti-poverty strategy unit based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing and worked examples which were distributed to all Government Departments last year. The unit has also met liaison officers in all Government Departments and discussed poverty proofing with them in order to assist with any difficulties.</P>
      <P>All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998. In relation to my Department's preparations for the budget, key principles of the national anti-poverty strategy are built into the development of the social welfare budget package from the start and influence the development throughout. Documents outlining the proofing of the social welfare budget package will be available to anyone who expresses an interest from budget day, as they were last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has already assured this House that the income tax provisions in the forthcoming budget will be poverty proofed, having regard to the official guidelines on the matter. Spending Departments are responsible for poverty proofing expenditure measures.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the poverty proofing arrangements are currently being reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council. I expect that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation. Following the review my Department will consider further measures for improving the process.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party considers that in the past year and particularly in the lead up to Budget 2000, there was no poverty proofing of proposals. Will the Minister agree with that? That is evident from freedom of information disclosures. The Government did not do anything in this regard in terms of its famous development in <Col N="1186" /> July 1998 or for the past year and a half. I want to help the Minister who must be under extreme pressure in Cabinet. Would he be prepared to give a press conference on 6 December and systematically go through the 15 Departments, including his own and especially Finance, and indicate to the Members and to the public how the Government has poverty proofed Budget 2001? </P>

It appears that Budget 2001 will not be poverty proofed. All we have heard is that training will be provided for civil servants, models will be introduced etc. The Minister is misleading the House in this regard. He launched two reports recently. He and I were present on the day the social inclusion strategy was launched. That made clear, as did the report on lone parents, that we still have a situation where almost one-fifth of Irish children are living in poverty, even the latest figures show that despite our Celtic tiger economy, one-fifth of Irish children are living in poverty and one-third of single parents are experiencing poverty. Children are twice <Col N="1187" /> as likely to experience poverty as adults. The Minister has responsibility for this area. Will the Government poverty proof Budget 2001?

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme was introduced in 1984 with the specific purpose of providing an incentive to low paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the scheme to cover the self-employed has been considered on a number of occasions. Such consideration would have regard to a range of factors including: the practical difficulties associated with extending the scheme to the self-employed; the arrangements already in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes; and the cost of introducing such a measure in the context of the need to prioritise the use of the limited resources available for the development of a wider social welfare system. Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim unemployment assistance. The rate of unemployment assistance payable depends on the person's means. In assessing means, account is taken of the net income, which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year. I am aware that the family credit scheme, which operated in Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom, included provision for the self-employed. It is interesting to note that the UK has recently converted family credit from a social welfare payment to a tax credit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware, that a recently convened Programme for Prosperity and Fairness working group is examining the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems, including the possibility of paying family income supplement through the tax system.  In the course of their deliberations, they will evaluate the potential of the refundable tax credit as an instrument for delivering benefits on an equitable basis, with particular reference to families on low incomes, including self-employed families.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue which will involve a comparative examination of UK and other international models and require input from all Departments, including my own. Obviously measures which are capable of advancing the interests of low paid workers with families, including the self-employed, will be viewed positively by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his answer is similar to responses he has given over the past three years and that he has made no progress in extending this to the self-employed? Regarding the working group set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, can he give us an idea of how that work is going, what progress is being made and when it is likely to report? The Minister mentioned the system in the UK and seemed to imply that it would be too difficult to operate that system here. How come if it operates successfully in the UK it cannot <Col N="1189" /> operate here? The Minister said that those on low incomes, even if they were self-employed, can get UA but he totally misunderstands the system if he says so. The benefits that would accrue to people on low income through FIS are different from what might accrue under the UA system. UA would be far less than what they might qualify for with the same income under FIS. That is something the Minister will have to look at. Does the Minister agree that many shopkeepers and postmistresses in rural villages who are on very low incomes trying to support familles and who would benefit significantly from extending this to the self-employed?</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent for any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommo<Col N="1191" /> dation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person after the payment of rent has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area. The average weekly rent supplement payment differs in each health board as the rents charged for accommodation vary across each health board area, reflecting market forces and local conditions. Colour RGB 170,0,0For example, the limits set in all health board areas take into account information received from local auctioneers and letting agents regarding average rents charged in the area.</P>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. Health boards must satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health board has discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information:</i>The overall result is that, regardless of which weekly social welfare payment they receive, a single person on rent supplement has £70 per week after they have paid their rent and a couple has £117 per week, with an increase of £13.20 for each qualified child in both cases.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure that the best possible housing options are made available to people with long-term housing needs who currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>
    <P>In addition, a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently under way. All aspects of the scheme will be examined, including <Col N="1192" /> the arrangements governing payment of rent supplements to people on social welfare incomes. The report is due at the end of next year. I believe that these initiatives will lead to substantial improvements for people on social welfare incomes who are renting in the private sector.</P>

Is there a better way of giving money to people in those circumstances which will not encourage an increase in rent? As Deputy Broughan stated, rents are simply rocketing. I have been approached by people who informed me that they cannot afford to pay their rent and that there is a limit on what they can obtain from the health boards. Is there a better way of giving money to people other than giving them a rent allowance which is continually increasing, which, in turn, leads to increases in rents?</P>

I accept that rents have risen dramatically but health boards, at their own discretion without reference to my Department or the Department of Finance, can raise the level of rent in their areas, depending on local circumstances. That is one of the reasons the rent supplement has increased. The number of people in receipt of rent supplement over the ten year period to which I referred has not increased dramatically but the money on offer has increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 7 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be entitled to an unemployment payment a person must satisfy the statutory conditions of being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable full-time work. Thus, to be regarded as genuinely seeking work a person must show that he or she is taking reasonable steps to obtain suitable full-time work, including applying for and seeking information on jobs and availing of suitable training opportunities. Part-time and casual workers must be available for and genuinely seeking work for the periods when they are not employed. To qualify <Col N="1194" /> for a payment, part-time workers who work two or three days a week must make efforts to find work for the other days of the week or find full-time work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>These requirements are set out in regulations. To ensure that these regulations are applied consistently and uniformly detailed guidelines have been issued to the statutorily appointed deciding officers who decide unemployment claims and appropriate training has been provided. In the current economic climate there are many employment opportunities available, both full-time and part-time and many employers state that they are finding it difficult to fill vacancies in that context. Deciding officers are placing greater emphasis on reviewing and testing individuals' efforts to obtain full-time employment.</P>
    <P>As the numbers of those on the live register continue to fall, all persons in receipt of unemployment payments are having their claims reviewed on a more regular, systematic basis with a view to helping them make the transition from welfare to work. The employment action plan, which is a joint initiative between FÁS and my Department, offers support and guidance to help people find suitable work through the development of an action plan and the provision of appropriate training. My Department is also taking a more holistic approach for unemployed persons by identifying the availability of assistance from other agencies and opportunities for employment and training.</P>
    <P>There is no policy to select any particular profession or geographical area for more rigorous examination. Each case is decided in accordance with the regulations, having regard to what is reasonable in that particular case. If a deciding officer decides that a person does not fulfil the conditions, the claim is formally disallowed. Anybody who is not satisfied with a deciding officer's decision may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the statutory conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are being applied in a fair and reasonable fashion having regard to the conditions which exist in the labour market.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister target very vulnerable workers such as lollipop ladies who might have part-time duties and crassly cut off their entitlement to unemployment benefit, which they traditionally received during holiday periods? The Minister definitely targeted certain geographical areas. I understand that in areas <Col N="1195" /> such as Kerry, which have strong tourism industries and, traditionally, are home to many part-time workers &ndash; very often these are women &ndash; who could draw unemployment benefit when the tourist season was over, the Minister targeted those workers in a most mean-spirited way.</P>

      <P>I cannot change the rules that have applied to unemployment benefit and assistance for many years. People should be available for work. There was a time when there were no jobs available during the summer months or periods in which people were not required in their professions. That is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am answerable not only to this House, but to the Comptroller and Auditor General for the spending of taxpayer's money. There was full consultation in this House on the guidelines laid down which were commenced by my predecessor. There was also a full discussion at the social affairs committee on availability for work and whether someone is genuinely seeking work. It is not as if anyone was hoodwinked. Circumstances have changed and deciding officers have acted accordingly. There are jobs available and <Col N="1197" /> employers are crying out for people to fill them. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect that people should work when jobs are available, rather than claim off the State. For too long politicians have been accused of turning a blind eye.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the action he will take to ensure maintenance payments are made by parents; if he is considering changes in this area; his response to recommendations in a recent report on one parent families in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation applicants for one parent family payment are required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouse or the parent of their child in the case of unmarried applicants. Normally, such maintenance is obtained by way of informal negotiation or by court order under family law, though separated couples are increasingly using the family mediation service which my Department has been progressively extending countrywide.</P>
      <P>Under the liability to maintain family provisions of the Social Welfare Acts, a person has a legal responsibility to support his or her spouse and dependent children. Where social welfare support is being provided for the one parent family, the other parent is legally liable to contribute to the cost of the payment. In implementing these provisions to date the Department has concentrated on those cases where the liable relatives concerned, being in employment or self-employment, appear to be in a better financial position to make a contribution towards the relevant benefit or allowance being paid by the Department to their families.</P>
      <P>One of the main conclusions of the review of one parent family payment conducted by my Department and published on 5 September was that the increasing cost of the scheme will place more focus on the arrangements for maintenance provisions and the way society views parents who do not take financial responsibility for their children at the State's expense.</P>
      <P>On the issue of maintenance, the review sets out a very comprehensive analysis of the options in this area. It recommended that the system should be enforced more vigorously while bearing in mind value for money considerations. My Department is actively considering the implications of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other recommendations in the review were that one parent family payment claimants be allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance <Col N="1198" /> they secure as an encouragement to seek maintenance; and that lump sum payments made by a liable relative should be regarded as a contribution towards his or her obligation to the Department in respect of social welfare payments issued to the other partner.</P>
    <P>I am examining these options in the context of further improvements generally in the social welfare system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 31, 44, 57, 63, 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Carer's allowance is a means tested payment administered by my Department for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. Based on research conducted in the review of carer's allowance published in October 1998, the number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000 covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. At the end of October there were 16,176 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of carer's allowance, an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance which was £36.5 million in 1997 when I became Minister and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner is assessable is applied to carer's allowance to ensure limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of these changes means that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up to £19,500 could still qualify for a minimum carer's allowance and also receive an annual respite care grant, introduced by me, and the free schemes.</P>
      <P>The review of carer's allowance noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those most in need. The estimated cost of abolishing the means test and extending carer's allowance at existing levels to all full-time carers would be in the region of £179 million annually. In view of the wide range of services required, including community and respite care, to support carers in their caring role, it is doubtful if a payment to all carers, regardless of income, could be considered the best use of resources. However, the position on the means test will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a gen<Col N="1200" /> eral rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to ensure limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review of carer's allowance concluded that this practice should continue. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>One of the many innovative measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant and in budget 2000 I made provision to increase this grant from £200 to £300. This grant is payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance to use in whatever way they choose. There has been very positive feedback on this payment and I will keep its operation under review.</P>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants for those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. I understand the Western Health Board agreed to undertake this pilot project in its area and the results of this study are being considered by a working group. Developing the needs assessment system to encompass the type of database suggested or a cost of care allowance would also be a matter for the Minister for Health and Children to consider. On data generally, I understand from the Central Statistics Office that the next census will collect information on carers, something we would all welcome.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community. The many measures I have introduced in recent budgets clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. It is considered unnecessary to introduce legislation or a constitutional amendment to recognise the valuable role of carers and the appreciation we must all have for their role in society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> The question of further improvement to carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 10 and the total numbers of carers, is it not extraordinary that the Department and the Department of Health and Children have made no real effort to date to find out how many carers there are? How on earth can we frame policy for one of the most vulnerable sectors of society if we are not prepared to compile statistics? According to the Minister, the Central Statistics Office will do wonderful things next year. Apparently, there will be a Dáil revision if the Government survives until 2002.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not deeply embarrassed by the report of the Western Health Board which shows that in that small part of the country there are 20,000 full-time carers? The Minister still does not give carer's allowance to that number of carers in the entire country. Are we talking about 50,000, 100,000 or 150,000 people? Anecdotal evidence would suggest that there are far more carers than the Minister is prepared to give credit for.</P>

      <P>The other issues relating to carers are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children. The Minister for Health and Children and I have generally discussed the issue of care. The carer's allowance is a social welfare payment and, ultimately, any social welfare payment is targeted at the less well off. If we were to do away with the income disregard, we would effectively end up giving a non-means tested payment to everyone who considers himself or herself a carer. Many people, who would otherwise be well able to afford to care for their loved ones, would receive the allowance and that would merely serve to dilute the available funds.</P>

      <P>There has been a number of improvements in the carer's allowance. However, does the Minister accept that in a time of economic prosperity such as we are experiencing, it is unacceptable that such a small proportion of those who care for people in their homes receive any income whatsoever from the State? The proportion of people in receipt of financial support is very small. The Carers Association estimates that up to 150,000 people care for people in their homes, yet the carer's allowance is provided to a very small group. Does the Minister accept that more money should be channelled towards people who are providing caring services in the community which would cost the State a fortune were people to go into residential care? Does the <Col N="1204" /> Minister accept that the means test, which is quite stringent at present and which excludes the vast majority of carers, should be eased? Carers have enormous needs. Does the Minister accept that a continuous care payment is essential given the costs of caring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand on my record. I accept that more money should be directed to this area. The carer's allowance was introduced by Deputy Woods in 1990 when he was Minister for Social Welfare. At that time, £100,000 was provided in the Estimate for the carer's allowance. Ten years on, the Estimate includes a provision for carer's allowance of more than £78 million. The amount of money provided has increased from £36 million to £78 million since I became Minister and it will increase substantially again in any future budget during my term of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme designed to facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities who are finding it difficult to obtain employment and to improve their qualifications with a view to returning to the active workforce.</P>
      <P>There are two study options available under the scheme, namely, the second level option under which a person may attend a second level full-time course leading to a recognised certificate and the third level option under which a person can attend an approved full-time third level course at a university or third level institution. Such a course can be at undergraduate or postgraduate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for participation in the scheme a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, be at least 21 years of age for approved second and third level courses and <Col N="1206" /> at least 24 years of age for approved third level postgraduate courses. I believe that these age limits are reasonable having regard to the nature of the scheme, namely the fact that it is there to support people who have been out of the educational system and have been unable to obtain employment over a period. The scheme is not and never was intended to be a scheme of financial assistance generally for people taking up educational courses or to support any existing arrangements for the support of students in general.</P>
    <P>In September 1999 I reduced the qualifying age under the scheme for recipients of disability allowance, blind person's pension, invalidity pension and unemployability supplement to 18 years. This reflects the special difficulties which recipients of these payments can face when attempting to find work or improve their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>The back to education allowance scheme has proved to be very successful to date and is an integral and important part of my Department's employment support services. It reflects my policy of making our social welfare system more work supportive by encouraging people to leave welfare support as soon as they are able to do so and return to the active labour market. I am arranging for a review of the scheme to be carried out and the question of an appropriate age limit for the scheme in present circumstances will be among the issue to be addressed as part of this process.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure for the back to education allowance scheme in 1999 was £19.9 million and the estimated cost for 2000 is £23.1 million. During the 1999-2000 academic year, 5,388 availed of the back to education allowance. Of these, 623 availed of the second level option and 4,765 availed of the third level option, of whom 591 are pursuing third level postgraduate courses of study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Deputy Broughan Deputy Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might be aware that recently Trinity College and UCD took part in a survey which showed that 2% of the student body came from the semi-skilled and unskilled segments of society which constitute 25% of the population in Dublin. This is an extraordinary statistic. Obviously, Joe Duffy I and were among the 2%, although at that time the percentage was even smaller. Does this not highlight educational disadvantage? It is not unknown for girls of 16 or 17 years of age to have a child, to miss six to nine months of second level education during their pregnancy and then to come to us at 18 or 19 years of age wanting to return to the second level system, which opens the gate to third level. Will the Minister look at this sympathetically, at second and third levels, to encourage people whose education has been interrupted for whatever reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme was never intended to be a substitute or addition to the student support grant schemes under the Department of <Col N="1207" /> Education and Science. The age limit was set, subject to the amendments I have made, in order to give people a second chance, particularly those who are long-term unemployed who have been out of the education system for quite a long time. Figures from the Department of Education and Science show that 59% of the current student population are under 21 years of age. Therefore, reducing the age limit to under 21 years of age would have huge cost implications. There is also a danger that if it is reduced to 18, people might go directly from school onto unemployment benefit with a view to taking up this scheme after six months.</P>
      <P>The issue of reducing the age limit has been raised from time to time and I will keep it under review. However, there are difficulties &ndash; it is not just a matter of reducing the age limit. There is a justifiable case for reducing the age limit for a number of special cases, particularly for those with disabilities, and we have done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see particular circumstances of disadvantage where this would benefit people, such as those mentioned by Deputy Broughan, including single parents who have had to take time out from second level schools, and that a scheme targeted at specific socio-economic groups could be very beneficial? It would help them in the longer term by taking them off welfare dependency, giving them an education and getting them back to work. Would this not have decided merit? Will the Minister agree to examine a focused form of back to education allowance which could kick in at 18 or 19 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully what the Deputy has said and I will keep it under review, but I cannot guarantee I will do anything as the more the limit is reduced the more it will begin to replace the existing supports. I am also advised there is a significant danger that if the age limit was lowered, people would purposely go on the live register in order to get the allowance. It is designed to give people a second chance and to return to education. The figures show that 5,388 people are benefiting from the scheme, which is a substantial number. Most of these are benefiting in terms of third level.</P>

      <P>At issue, now, are questions of ethical propriety, of consent and of responsibility. These children were in the care of the State and it is important to establish if the State fulfilled its obligations to them.</P>
      <P>The report I present to the House today, and which I have placed in the Dáil library, does not &ndash; indeed, could not provide the answers to all the questions raised. It cannot be the end of our investigation of this issue and, a little later, I will propose what I believe is the best method of establishing the full truth, the context and the implications of these trials.</P>
      <P>I will provide some background information on three trials. Trial No. 1, published in 1962, looked at what would happen if four vaccines &ndash; diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio &ndash; were combined in one. At the time, the standard approach was to administer tetanus vaccine &ndash; DPT &ndash; and polio vaccine separately, at different times and at different injection sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trial No. 2, published in 1971, was to find out if German measles vaccine, administered intran<Col N="1209" /> asally, could spread to susceptible contacts. Clearly, if it did, serious consequences could ensue, particularly for pregnant women.</P>
    <P>Trial No. 3 was carried out during 1973 but not published. What it compared was the propensity of a commercially available DPT vaccine to produce adverse reactions, as against the capacity of a modified vaccine to produce the same reactions. The modified vaccine had fewer organisms per dose.</P>
    <P>Concern about this matter first surfaced almost a decade ago, raised by former residents of children's homes where the vaccination trials appear to have been conducted. The then Minister for Health first answered questions in the Dáil on this matter in 1991. In 1993, there was correspondence between the then Minister and a former resident in a Dublin children's home. In 1997, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, promised the House that he would have inquiries made into the matter, following which he would consider what was the most appropriate action to take. The Minister commissioned Dr. James Kiely, chief medical officer of the Department, to make the promised inquiries.</P>
    <P>From the moment I became Minister for Health and Children, I have been aware of this issue. I have met a representative of past residents of a number of children's homes who believe they might have been involved in these trials.</P>
    <P>Even though there does not seem to have been any negative medical outcome from any of these children, the story has made many of them extremely anxious. I have arranged with the chief executive officers of the relevant health boards &ndash; the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board &ndash; that, where supporting documentary evidence is available, former residents can be immediately informed whether they were part of any of these three trials. For former residents of the homes in the Dublin area the Eastern Regional Health Authority customer service number is 1800 520 520 and for former residents of Bessboro in Cork the relevant Southern Health Board number is 021 4861360.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have ensured a counselling service for any former resident of a children's home involved in such trials. It is available on demand from the relevant health boards and I would encourage anybody in this position to lift the phone and ask for the service. That is by way of background to today's publication of the chief medical officer's report.</P>
    <P>Before submitting his report to me, Dr. Kiely sent draft copies to anybody named in it who might be affected by its publication. That afforded them the opportunity to comment on the contents. All those comments were fully considered.</P>
    <P>Late yesterday evening we received further correspondence from solicitors on behalf of one of the persons named in the report, and some further issues were raised. As it was too late to include in the report, I am placing that correspon<Col N="1210" /> dence, in the appendices attached to the report, in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the trials appear to have had no medically negative consequences for any of the children involved. In some cases, the vaccine used was somewhat weaker than the alternative but when this emerged, booster doses were given to many of the children involved. We have no evidence that any child contracted a serious illness as a result of the trials.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the report makes no suggestion that any child was directly harmed by these trials and that two of them were published in prestigious medical publications, it might be expected that, as Minister for Health and Children, I should now be saying that is the end of the story. I want to make it clear definitely, however, that is not what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer's report is a good one but it is incomplete. It raises as many questions as it answers and some of those questions go to the heart of our attitudes to children and their rights. The report is incomplete because in some areas the most rigorous interrogation of the system failed to produce documentary records of the trials. In some cases the consultant who conducted the trials believed they took place in particular homes, but the homes do not have files that substantiate this.</P>
    <P>While we must remember that the trials were not recent, this lack of documentation is, at best, puzzling. It is certainly unsatisfactory. It is my hope that publication of this report, with the action I will propose to the House, will perhaps help us to fill in the missing bits of the jigsaw by stimulating memories or helping to locate lost files.</P>
    <P>I have read and re-read this report and I have discussed it with the chief medical officer in detail. In spite of the informational gaps and the indications that no child was medically harmed, each reading made me more sure that his work must be regarded as the beginning, not the end, of the matter. When a child comes into the care of the State, the State must fight fiercely for all that child's rights, including bodily integrity. The State does not have the right to view children in care as lesser citizens. Their bodily integrity is a basic human right which can never be watered down or infringed.</P>
    <P>Clearly, when we look at vaccination trials, the issue of informed consent is immediately involved. I am not satisfied that the chief medical officer has been able to find solid, informed consent, on the record, given by the people who were entitled to give it. Let me put this in context. The history of drug trials includes some ghastly case studies where the rights of individuals were grievously ignored. There have been cases in other countries where prisoners and members of the armed forces were involved in the trials of substances without their knowledge or informed consent. There have even been cases &ndash; again, in other countries &ndash; where prisoners suffering a lethal illness were used as a &ldquo;control group&rdquo;. In <Col N="1211" /> other words, they were not given a medicine which the authorities knew would save their lives. Instead, they were left untreated to suffer and die in the interests of providing a point of comparison.</P>
    <P>The vaccine trials covered in this report are in a different league, a different country and a different time. In addressing them, we must be careful of the reputations of the highly regarded professionals involved. We must remember that in many cases we are looking at marginal degrees of difference in the vaccines administered, not at experimental, unproven or dangerous medications. We must take into account that the protocols of 30 years ago are not necessarily the protocols applied today.</P>
    <P>The key issue of consent, however, cannot be fudged because it is fundamental. Children in care have the same rights as other children and the vindication of those rights is the constant responsibility of the State. We need to find out if we cared for the children the way we, as a nation, should have cared for them. If we did not we need to find out the reason for the failure to do so and to apply what we learn to the future. That is our responsibility, as legislators, to the general good.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my responsibility goes further. It goes to the individual children involved and it means I must ask questions that this report cannot answer, as follows. If one group of children was given the more experimental vaccine, why was it the children in care who got that one? What rationale led to the decision that children not in the State's care got the regular vaccine and children in the State's care got the variant? Was the end result from each trial for the public good or for the commercial advantage of a manufacturer? Why were some medications given to children who were outside the age group at which those medications were known to be effective? Above all, we must ask why the records of some of the trials are so woefully inadequate at almost every point?</P>
    <P>All those questions must be asked, irrespective of the overall intent of the trials and the indications that no child suffered medically as a result. Not only must they be asked, but they must be asked in a context which offers the competence to do investigative and therapeutic trawls. For that reason, I propose to send this report to the Commission on Child Abuse headed by Ms Justice Laffoy, so that she may consider it as part of her wide-ranging investigation. It is a decision based on the rights of the survivors who are entitled to a thorough, wide-ranging and public investigation of the ethical issues involved.</P>
    <P>The Laffoy commission offers a comprehensive vehicle for dealing expeditiously and rigorously with the totality of the issues. Its terms of reference are broad and, clearly, this issue comes within its remit. It has the full gamut of powers and personnel needed, an experienced secretariat, a strong panel of experts with the requisite qualifications and an investigative and legal <Col N="1212" /> infrastructure, all up and running. That combination offers an unrivalled capacity for ruthless thoroughness and appropriate speed. Much of what the Laffoy commission has been investigating runs parallel to this, so the search methods for documents going back to the 1950s is in place.</P>
    <P>There is a clear synergy between investigating this matter and the other matters being addressed by Ms Justice Laffoy. The full gamut of powers at the commission's disposal means that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Not only does the instrument for comprehensive investigation exist, but it also has compellability and the capacity to provide confidentiality to witnesses. For all these reasons, I suggest to the House that the Laffoy commission is best placed to consider these trials and offers a substantial public forum, not just for those survivors who already believe they were involved, but to many others who, partly as a result of publication of this report, may identify themselves in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>While on this point I want to nail some mischievous rumours put about in the past couple of days that if this report goes to Laffoy it would somehow let the Department of Health and Children off the hook. The suggestion is that Laffoy could not investigate the Department, but that, quite simply, is nonsense. Anybody and everybody can be investigated by the Laffoy Commission. This route is the ultimate guarantor against a cover-up or whitewash of any kind. I want the survivors to be sure of that.</P>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy has indicated her willingness and competence to take this on and I am grateful to her. My Department will, of course, co-operate fully with her commission because we believe that entering this process makes the following clear and unambiguous statement to survivors: &ldquo;We don't know whether your rights were protected all those years ago, we just don't know the full facts, but we believe it is important, for you and for the wider society, to move heaven and earth to find out; we want to do it in a forum which has the power to investigate, to compel witnesses, to publish its findings, without fear or favour, and to ensure compensation is made if this is required&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware that members of the Oireachtas wish the report to go before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. As both the Taoiseach and I have said, the report will be referred to that committee for discussion by way of a motion in this House next week. Further investigation is an imperative and the Laffoy Commission is the entity best placed to undertake that investigation.</P>
    <P>A desperately simple question arises from this report. Reading it, one finds oneself wondering aloud, who was minding the rights of the children? We do not know the full answer to that, but we can answer the second question as to who is minding the rights of the survivors? Through the information and counselling services arranged with the health boards, through the publication of this report and through its proper referral to the Laffoy commission, it is clear that we are <Col N="1213" /> determined to vindicate the rights of the adults who, as children, participated in these trials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, this report deals with three sets of vaccine trials carried out in the 1960s and 1970s. Trial one refers to 58 infants resident in five children's homes in Ireland. This compared polio vaccination, given separately to the three-in-one &ndash; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis or whooping cough &ndash; with a quadruple vaccine where all four were given together.</P>
      <P>Trial two involved 69 children in children's homes in Dublin and 23 children living at home who were given the same vaccine, Rubella, which related, I understand, to potential mental handicap.</P>
      <P>Trial three refers to 53 children in mother and baby and children's homes in Dublin, five homes in all, and 65 children at home who were given different sets of vaccines. The children in institutions were administered a modified three in one vaccine. The children who lived with their parents got the usual vaccine available at the time from the Eastern Health Board, as it was then known. Trial three was carried out at the instigation of the Eastern Health Board in 1973 because of an increase in adverse reactions to three in one vaccines in use at the time in the board's area. No objections were raised by the National Drugs Advisory Board, an agency of the then Department of Health, to these trials going ahead.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has questions to answer on this latter point. Both it and the Minister are too eager to refer this report to the Laffoy commission where it will be lost among even more serious allegations and may not be reached for some years. This matter should be examined and reported on separately to shed light wherever it needs to be shed. The Department of Health and Children should not be allowed to decide where a report which may involve issues in which it is complicit should be sent.</P>
      <P>The role of the Department of Health and Children needs examination. An expert group was established by the then Minister for Health in 1977 to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination in the 1960s and 1970s. The group found that, in 16 of the 93 cases presented to it, there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment was offered to each of the 16, a paltry £16,000, and 15 took the payment. In 1992 the Supreme Court found in favour of the 16th, Kenneth Best. The vaccine was administered to at least 243 children in 1968 and 1969 according to research I have seen. Those dates are relevant to the report we are debating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter is that there must be a reasonable suspicion that there may have been some connection between the bad batch of whooping cough vaccination and the reaction to it by so many children throughout the country <Col N="1214" /> and the trial tests subsequently carried out on children, especially those in institutions, to which the report we debate refers. If that is the case, then the Department of Health and Children and/or its agencies share culpability.</P>
    <P>By sending the report to the Laffoy commission, the role of the Department of Health and Children will be lost among a welter of detail. It is to Dáil Éireann that the Minister for Health and Children and his Department and its agencies must account. For that reason alone the report should be examined in detail by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children with powers to send for persons, papers and records and to compel the attendance of witnesses. The committee was led to believe that the report would be sent to it.</P>
    <P>That the Department of Health and Children, an actor in this saga, should itself decide where the report goes raises serious questions. This is a smoke bomb, a three card trick. The Minister for Health and Children is buying cover for himself and his Department at the expense of the reputations of people who certainly are not in the category of child molesters or physical or sexual child abusers.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that many of the people mentioned in the report have questions to answer. In all this we must be centrally concerned about the former residents of the institutions, the children to whom the report refers. However, I contend that their rights, needs and best interests are also being abused by the Minister referring the report to the Laffoy commission which is dealing with abuse <i>per se</i>.</P>
    <P>The commission has been charged with the responsibility</P>
    <P>. to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and other places in the period from 1940, or such earlier date as the commission considers appropriate, to the present, including the antecedents, circumstances, factors and context of such abuse, the perspective of the victims and the motives and perspectives of the persons responsible for committing abuse.</P>
    <P>The commission also has the role</P>
    <P>. to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum.</P>
    <P>These children were very young. They were not in a position to tell what happened to them. They are being lumped in with these people who rightly have the opportunity to put their case and be heard. However, the people at the bottom of the queue will be those on whom these trial tests were carried out. They have been duped by the Minister into believing this is the way to go. This is not the way to proceed because it is not in their interests. It is in the interests of the Minister and his Department and that is why he has been so <Col N="1215" /> energetic in persuading people that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Whereas it is absolutely outrageous that any children in institutions were used as guinea pigs and whereas it is important that they be provided with any counselling and support as is necessary and with whatever compensation is appropriate and fair, it is hardly serving their interests to group them with children who have suffered sexual and/or physical abuse. It is also hardly fair to the people in whose care they were that this implication should be raised. This is so especially because of the content of the report we are debating.</P>
    <P>The report states that, &ldquo;theoretically&rdquo;, vaccines did not leave children open to adverse effects and that there is no evidence that any occurred. The word &ldquo;theoretically&rdquo; is interesting. Where the report strongly implies criticism is in the importation of vaccines. The report states that it could not find legal authority either under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, or UCD's licence No. 216 to carry on such trials outside UCD. It also points out that this was well understood, although perhaps not well enough by all concerned.</P>
    <P>The report points strongly to breaches of the Nuremberg Code, 1947, and the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964, by the 18th World Medical Assembly on consent. It was very clear that the medical ethic of the day, which should have been known to researchers, stressed strongly the need for consent. There is no evidence that consent was given, although a researcher claims it was.</P>
    <P>These latter issues are themselves serious but we must ask, in fairness to all concerned, if this equates to physical or sexual abuse. At its most extreme is it not medical arrogance in full flight? Looking back on the 1960s and 1970s, such professional arrogance was not unusual. This is not to excuse what happened. The children used as guinea pigs are entitled to a full explanation and whatever support and compensation is appropriate. However, all the players must be called to account for the roles they played. The Minister for Health and Children is doing a disservice to these children by simply fobbing off the report on the Laffoy commission and, thereby, letting his Department and its agencies off the hook, perhaps at the expense of the reputations of people who may have been unwise but well intentioned and who certainly were not abusers. To try to correct an injustice done to one group by doing an injustice to others is to perpetuate injustice.</P>
    <P>If the Minister insists on voting this through and sending the matter to the Laffoy commission, then he should at the very least agree with me that the Oireachtas committee should be empowered to examine the other matters, namely, the role of the Department of Health at that time and the role of the Department of Health and Children at this time in trying to smokescreen its way out of its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to points the Minister made. He <Col N="1216" /> referred to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Southern Health Board being asked to make themselves available. The report also refers to the midlands where tests were carried out. Why is the Midland Health Board not involved in this matter?</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the report makes no suggestion that any child was directly harmed by these trials, and in view of the fact that two of them were published in prestigious medical publications, it might be expected that, as Minister for Health and Children, I should now be saying that is the end of the story.</P>
    <P>No one suggests he should say that. His Department has a role in this story which needs to be explained and it will not be explained at a child abuse commission. The Minister also said that questions remain to be answered. There are questions which need to be answered which the Minister did not include in his speech. For example, what was the role of the Department of Health and Children and its agencies? There were no health boards until the early 1970s. Why should the Department decide who can investigate this matter? That is like an accused or an accomplice deciding who will be the judge and jury examining his or her case.</P>
    <P>The Minister said Ms Justice Laffoy will look at this as part of her wide-ranging investigation. This should not be part of a wide-ranging investigation &ndash; it should be a specific investigation. It has been sent to the Laffoy tribunal so that it will be lost among these wide-ranging issues.</P>
    <P>If Members of the House think this matter should go to the Laffoy tribunal, let that be the decision of the Oireachtas committee and the House, and not the decision of the Department which itself has questions to answer.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech, &ldquo;The suggestion is that Laffoy could not investigate the Department itself&rdquo;. That is not the suggestion. The suggestion is that if we ask the Minister and his officials to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to answer questions next week when the matter is referred to it for discussion, they will use the excuse and smoke screen of saying the matter is with the Laffoy tribunal and they cannot answer questions before a committee of the Houses at the same time. That is my concern. If we want to send it to the Laffoy tribunal after our investigation, that will be fine. However, questions must be answered in the Dáil because the Department of Health and Children is answerable to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out in his speech that, &ldquo;Further investigation is an imperative and the Laffoy tribunal is the entity best placed to undertake that investigation&rdquo;. Ministers and their civil servants are accountable to this House. This is Parliament. They are accountable now. The Oireachtas committee should investigate these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked, &ldquo;Who was minding the <Col N="1217" /> rights of the children?&rdquo;. That is the point I have been making. The Department of Health and its agencies certainly were not. That is the kernel of this matter. The people who were partly culpable are the people who now want to decide who should investigate this report.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable to me for this matter to be referred next week to the Oireachtas committee for discussion without debate. The leader of my party and I gave notice on the Order of Business that we would require a motion to be put before the House which was debatable and capable of being amended I am giving notice now that we will not agree to take this reference next Tuesday without debate. I am asking the Minister, in all that is appropriate and decent in terms of parliamentary procedure, not to refer this report to the Laffoy tribunal until Dáil Éireann has had the opportunity to make its opinion known in a vote in the House next Tuesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question that needs to be answered in relation to this report is why the Minister and his Department have deliberately delayed publishing it. The report was commissioned by the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, in mid 1997. In early 1999 it was reported in the media that the report was finished and under scrutiny by the Attorney General. In effect, the Government has sat on this report for almost two years.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has questions to answer and the public is entitled to hear his answers. Have his time and effort been invested elsewhere, instead of concentrating on this report? The Attorney General, instead of concentrating on the needs of those who were children in institutions, has been concentrating on constructing a vehicle designed to provide a political future for himself. He is concerned, it is widely reported, about delivering a united Ireland, but under his watch it has taken until now to deliver this report. Why?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children in May 2000 stated in reply to a parliamentary question that the report would be back with him within weeks for it to be published. Yet, it is only now appearing after six months. Why? This extraordinary delay raises serious questions about the priorities of the Attorney General, the capability of the Government to deal with issues effectively and the lack of accountability of the Department of Health and Children. It casts a shadow on the assertions made in the Minister's speech about how he is dealing with the issues relating to survivors. His record is one of delay rather than action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is unsatisfactory in many ways. It raises as many questions as it answers. I support the referral of the report to the independent commission, already established to investigate the maltreatment and abuse of children in institutions. I have listened to the adults who were children in the orphanages and homes where these trials were carried out. I find it <Col N="1218" /> unacceptable that they were not interviewed as part of the preparation of the report. They are clear about the recourse they want, which is to refer this matter to the Laffoy tribunal. I am surprised at the approach being adopted by Fine Gael, which is opposing the views of those directly affected. It is not respectful of them to call these people dupes.</P>

      <P>It is not acceptable to patronise people who have suffered over the years from powerful people telling them what was good for them, an opinion which was often wrong. Those people are telling us what they want and I support their demands and needs. We should take that on board. The Laffoy tribunal has fortuitously been established by statute and is capable of taking on the task.</P>
      <P>It is important that fairness prevails in the work of the tribunal and that the danger of hindsight distorting the truth surrounding these clinical trials be averted. All sides must be heard and all possible evidence needs to be garnered. However, the report does not inspire confidence that all the evidence is even available. There are references throughout to a lack of records. This has a major impact on the conclusions. We do not have sufficient information and, more importantly, those directly affected do not have information about their experiences.</P>
      <P>This lack of information is part of a bigger picture which affects adopted people in a way that is quite disturbing. At present, adopted people do not have an automatic right to their own medical records. They can only apply to the adoption board for such information. It is up to the board to determine whether they can gain access to such information. It is insupportable that people should be denied such information under any circumstances. I urge the Minister to progress promises made by the Government to introduce the adoption information Bill at the earliest possible opportunity to deal with an injustice that does not belong to the past, like these clinical trials, but is currently still militating against the civil rights of the approximately 40,000 people who were adopted since the passing of the Adoption Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>Key questions have not been answered in this report. The first is why did a British pharmaceutical company choose to embark on clinical trials on children in Ireland? It is not clear why such work was not carried out in Britain, although one can surmise that the absence of legislation meant there was no proper regulatory framework here, other than the very limited Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932. The report rightly points out the paucity of statutory requirements, while acknowledging a general adherence to very generalised and limited international codes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question to be answered is why orphanages and mother and baby homes were selected. The vulnerability of children in these <Col N="1219" /> institutions should have provided them with protection from, rather than involvement in, clinical trials of this sort. It is well known that people living in institutions can experience greater ill health because of the greater risk of infection. It is on record that the trials were unfair in their application and that children who lived in their own homes were given safer injections &ndash; in the sense they were known to be safe at the time &ndash; than those given to children in the institutions.</P>
    <P>The question of greater infection was particularly true in institutions caring for babies and children. Yet, only one request that we know of to carry out a clinical vaccine trial in a mother and baby home was turned down by a Minister of Health, on the basis that the selection of this group was open to objection. We do not know why it was open to objection. That decision was made as early as 1962 according to the report. Why was it made then and why did a similar ground for objection not pertain in the later trials? The report is silent on these points. Another issue is why did statutory authorities such as the Eastern Health Board and the Adoption Board, which would have to supply information on follow-up checks of the children, agree to work, in effect, with a British pharmaceutical company? Did those bodies not consider such trials were open to objection?</P>
    <P>Another issue is that of consent. There are clearly conflicting versions between the medical officers of these institutions and Professor Hillery in relation to consent. The conflict is not resolved in the report and the commission must address the record, in so far as it is possible to do so, on how research of this type was carried out in institutions. It is difficult to see how such research could have taken place without consent being given by someone in authority. That raises the question of the authority of medical officers to make a decision in <i>loco parentis</i> where procedures other than necessary medical treatment were involved.</P>
    <P>It is important that these and the other issues are dealt with comprehensively without further undue delay. We may never have all the facts. Looking back from today's perspective, the absence of vital documentation and records is totally unacceptable, particularly when one considers these were research projects which, of their nature, depend on the meticulous recording of information. We should note that the legislation controlling clinical trials was only introduced in 1987 and after the death of a young man who participated in a drug trial. Controls are now in place but they were not when these trials were carried out.</P>
    <P>We should also note that infectious diseases are a real and current danger to the health and lives of children. This year alone two babies died from contracting measles. They would not have died if our vaccination programme was fully effective. In parts of Dublin the measles vaccine take-up is on a par with some Third World countries. It is vital <Col N="1220" /> that vaccination programmes are developed and delivered to protect children. Clinical trials and research will continue to be part of these programmes but we must ensure that maintenance of the public good does not override the protection of vulnerable children. That is unacceptable now and it should have been unacceptable in the past.</P>
    <P>One aspect is worth noting. In the second trial to assess the value of an inter-nasally administered rubella vaccine, the vaccine was effective but it was abandoned because it was difficult for the people administering it but it suited the babies and children better. However, because those administering the vaccine found it easier to inject, that was the resultant form. This raises issues for the Department of Health and Children in regard to current vaccination practice.</P>
    <P>There are six vaccines being administered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This report will be discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and I welcome that. However, the most important measure and the one demanded by those most affected is to refer this to the Laffoy Commission to continue the work done but so clearly not completed by this report. The Minister for Health and Children needs to give an undertaking that there will be no question of putting this report at the bottom of the line as the commission is working <Col N="1221" /> out its priorities. I have sought a guarantee on this and those who were the unknowing participants in these trials and those who initiated them are entitled to the same guarantee.</P>

      <P>I would willingly have given the Deputy some of my time because I am indebted to her for her contribution. I was enraged when I read the language used in this report and, unfortunately, the comments made by Deputy Mitchell did nothing to decrease that rage. To use terms such as the Minister was abusing people, duping them or fobbing them off by referring this to the commission is wrong and tries to turn this issue into a political football. The people to whom Deputy McManus referred have stated what they want to happen. They deserve that much respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the State does not have the right to view children in care as lesser citizens. It is obvious from the language used in the letters on file in this report and from what has emerged from reports on children in the care of the State that not only did they view these children differently, they treated them differently. They were treated abominably. The documentary shown last Sunday is just another indication of the way children in care were treated.</P>
      <P>The two previous speakers referred to the participants as guinea pigs. There is no doubt that is precisely what they were used as: &ldquo;the participants in the investigation [1960-61] will be infants aged between three and 12 months resident in children's homes in Éire&rdquo;. If that is not picking out a particular group of guinea pigs with no voice and no one to speak for them, I do not know what is. Professor Irene Hillery, when discussing how it was decided to use these children, because ostensibly it would be difficult to follow them up in normal circumstances, said: </P>
      <P>The study was conducted entirely in accordance with acceptable medical ethical standards at the time. I obtained consent for the study from the medical officers in charge. I also obtained consent [this is really galling] from those mothers who requested information but not all were interested&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;as they were extremely concerned to protect their anonymity.</P>
      <P>I know, as I am sure other Members do, that was not a fact. These mothers did not have a voice and I am sure when this is pursued to its final outcome we will see that mothers were not asked because their consent and view on these issues was not considered to be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a letter on file relating to the response <Col N="1222" /> of the children. It states: &ldquo;We are indebted to the medical officers in charge of the children's homes.for permission to carry out this investigation on infants under their care and to their nursing staff for their unlimited patience and co-operation.&rdquo;  There is no mention of babies or mothers. These were simply guinea pigs and thanks were given to the homes, medical officers and nurses whose only job was to supply hot water. The content of the correspondence between those trying out the vaccines, the medical officers concerned and those in charge in the homes is unbelievable. I presume Ms Justice Laffoy will pursue this in her own way but the co-operation that will be required in order to see this issue through will not be forthcoming from homes where these vaccinations were carried out. I am convinced of that. The report speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>The case of a person, who is not in my constituency, was brought to my attention long before I knew anything about these trials. The person, who contacted me because of my involvement in the area of adoption and fostering, has repeatedly complained about the way he has been treated by somebody whose name is mentioned in the report. The authors of the report mention that they spoke to staff members in Bessboro and 78 infants were identified as having received vaccinations in that period. The report states: &ldquo;No doctor's signature, batch number, manufacturer&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nobody wishes to make a political football of this issue. It is too serious. It involves trials being conducted on almost 200 children, children who were treated as if they were &ldquo;children of a lesser god&rdquo;. We must find out the why, where and when. That is what this debate should be about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus wondered about the stance of the Fine Gael Party. One cannot conduct an opinion poll of the 200 children and find out exactly what each requires. There is a case to be made for the analysis put forward by Deputy McManus but there are people on the other side of the argument who want this matter investi<Col N="1223" /> gated by an inquiry or an Oireachtas committee rather than the Laffoy commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the comments made recently by a local authority member, a former resident of one of the homes involved. That councillor called on the Minister to ensure that the investigation would not be carried out by the Laffoy commission but by the Oireachtas committee. He is reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> as having said that the referral of this issue to the commission &ldquo;runs the serious and very real risk of inducing further anxiety and emotional stress&rdquo; for the victims in the drug testing issue by associating them with sexual abuse. That is the background.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell pointed out that the committee on health and children, using all its powers, can ask the relevant questions now. If it is referred to the Laffoy commission the least the Minister can do is assure the House &ndash; I am sure Deputy McManus will agree with me &ndash; that it will be dealt with quickly and not go to the bottom of the pile. The commission has a great deal of work to do and we need early and thorough answers on this issue. If it goes to the Laffoy commission, there should be another and fuller debate on this important matter next week in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sensitive and complex issue. I appreciate the difficulties that confront the Minister and I thank him for his courtesy and co-operation in the past few days.</P>
      <P>We need to listen to the victims. I am aware that Victor Boyhan made a statement a few weeks ago but I understand he now agrees with referring the report to the Laffoy commission. We can only listen to those people. What matters is that we secure accountability, transparency and truth. It has been said in the past few days that the medical establishment was guilty of, perhaps, arrogance but that what it did was not illegal. I do not accept that. It is not a question of whether it was legal or illegal but whether it was right, justified and ethical. Anybody who grew up in the 1960s would have seen the Christian Brothers hammering the living daylights out of people with their leathers. Was that legal or illegal? Strictly speaking, it was legal until the late John Boland outlawed corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>We need to look closely at the motives and whether the so-called advancement of medical science coincided with monetary gain. The link between the pharmaceutical companies and the medical establishment is a little too cosy for comfort. They brook no criticism, as I know from personal experience. I now have the Irish Medicines Board on my back. Legislators have a responsibility to examine not just what happened in the past but what is happening now in relation to vaccinations. I will give the House one&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I first sought to raise this issue two weeks ago when an advertisement appeared in the property supplements of <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i> newspapers. It advertised the sale of 29 properties at Enaville Avenue and St. Patrick's Avenue in Ballybough in Dublin's north inner city. I live in Ballybough and it is part of the constituency I represent. The advertisement stated that the opportunity presented by the sale of the 29 houses was a dream for first time buyers and builders.</P>
      <P>I was astounded by this. I knew there were families living in most if not all these little houses. The advertisement did not mention this. So much for the ethics and standards of the estate agents, Douglas Newman Good, which placed the advertisements. In effect, a community was being advertised for sale without its knowledge and without any reference to the plight of the tenants or, indeed, the responsibility of the landlord to them. It was as if these families did not count. Many of them are one parent families on social welfare or in part-time low paid jobs.</P>
      <P>The following Saturday, when prospective buyers went unwittingly to view the properties, they were horrified to find people living in them. Most of them promptly left. The landlord who orchestrated this was unmoved and determined to proceed with the public auction. I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in the House on 24 October, the day before the auction, as it was taking place in the Taoiseach's constituency. The tenants, meanwhile, had organised themselves and alerted the media and the local public representatives. As a result the auction was abandoned by the landlord, probably out of embarrassment, such was the strength of feeling and revulsion against his treatment of his tenants. However, the threat of eviction remains over the heads of these unfortunate people.</P>
      <P>This is a classic, if extreme, example which highlights a problem that many people face in Dublin and throughout Ireland. There are an estimated 120,000 households in private rented accommodation in the State. Few of them have security of tenure. The commission on the private rented residential sector reported to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last July. Its recommendations were limited and inadequate but they included giving tenants who have been in a property for six months an entitlement to a four year lease. I am unaware of any response so far from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plight of the families in Ballybough, many of whom are tenants of eight to ten years, has <Col N="1225" /> drawn attention to a number of issues. First is the fact that tenants of less than 20 years standing appear to have no rights under the laws of the State. Second, landlords can behave as if they have no responsibilities to their tenants, the State or the taxpayers who subsidise many of the rents which, in turn, enrich the landlords. Third, any tenant of less than 20 years tenancy has no security of tenure and no reasonable notice is required to evict them, other than a contemptuous notice to quit followed by an immediate court summons. Fourth, landlords can apparently accumulate and buy and sell properties with the tenants <i>in situ</i> and without any reference to the rights of these people.</P>
    <P>Fifth, following the abandoned option, the landlord simply announced his intention to increase rents, and it seems he can do this at will. If the health board does not cover the increased costs, he believes he can frighten and drive the tenants out. This is an increasing feature and mechanism in Dublin whereby landlords get rid of long-standing tenants and replace them with others who can afford higher rents. This is a widespread scandal and many elderly people have lost their homes in this way. There must be provision for rent restrictions, or a level imposed beyond which rents cannot be increased, based on the standard and location of the property.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to address urgently all these issues so that what was attempted in Ballybough, and very nearly achieved but for the vigilance and the organisational ability of the tenants, cannot happen again. This is not the first time this has happened. We have seen the example of the Mespil outrage. Temple Buildings in Upper Dominick Street suffered a similar fate. So far Ballybough and Enaville Avenue have been spared this. I call on the Minister to introduce measures urgently to prevent this type of outrage ever being repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I established a commission in July 1999 to examine the working of the landlord and tenant relationship and to make recommendations with a view to improving security of tenure for tenants, maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants and increasing investment and supply in and removing any constraints to the development of the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission was chaired by Mr. Tom Dunne, from the faculty of the built environment, Dublin Institute of Technology, and its 17 members were representative of tenant and landlord interests, the legal, accounting and auctioneering professions, property investment specialists and relevant Departments. The commission submitted its report on 14 July 2000 and I arranged for its publication on 27 July this year. I welcome the commission's report and I would like again to put on record my particular appreciation of the work of the Chairman, Tom Dunne, <Col N="1226" /> and the commission members in reporting within an extremely tight deadline.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to some of the main recommendations contained in the report. The commission has recommended the establishment by statute of a private residential tenancies board to deal with disputes between landlords and tenants and to provide advice and information in relation to the sector. Details of all tenancies would be registered with the board. It would be mandatory for tenants and landlords to refer to the board all disputes, from deposit retention to termination of a tenancy, where agreement between the parties cannot be reached. Determinations of the board would be binding and enforceable by being made an order of the courts. Appeal to the courts would arise only on a point of law.</P>
    <P>The commission proposes granting a tenant whose tenancy has not been terminated in the first six months a right to continue in occupation for the remainder of a four-year period unless the landlord needs to recover possession for specified reasons such as for own or family member occupation, to sell or to redevelop etc. Tenancies may be terminated at any time for failure by either party to comply with the lease terms or with obligations to be specified in the legislation. Successive four-year tenancy periods are envisaged, during the first six months of each of which the landlord will have an opportunity to terminate the tenancy without cause. The tenant may terminate at any time subject to giving the required notice. Regarding notice to quit, a graduated scheme, depending on length of tenancy in each four-year period with a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks is recommended.</P>
    <P>The commission recommends that rents should be no greater than the open market rate and reviews should be no more frequent than once per annum unless there has been a substantial improvement in the property.</P>
    <P>The commission recommendations for tax incentives for landlords who are compliant with the regulatory system and whose tenancies are registered with the board have the twin aims of promoting investment in and greater professionalism of the sector.</P>
    <P>I consider the commission's report to be comprehensive and well balanced and it is clear that much careful consideration has gone into the principal recommendations. The package of measures recommended represents a compromise of the diverse views held by the members as to the best way forward for the private rented residential sector. I accept the commission's contention that the report must be viewed as a total package and that, if elements are viewed or implemented in isolation, it could have detrimental or unintended consequences for the sector.</P>
    <P>Many of the commission's recommendations have implications for the landlord and tenant legislative code and for the taxation code which are the responsibility of my colleagues the Mini<Col N="1227" /> ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance respectively. Consultations have taken place in relation to those issues. The report has also been considered by the Housing Forum which generally supported the recommendations and considered they would provide a good basis for the long-term development of the sector if implemented as a package.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring forward proposals to Government in the very near future together with the programme for implementation of the broad thrust of the commission's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat as an seans a thabhairt dom an ceist thabhachtach sea a árdú, agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as teacht anseo chun é a fhreagairt.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the EU Commission has seen fit to take legal action against Ireland on the basis of non-compliance with Directives 75/442/EEC, 91/689/EEC and 94/62/EEC, the latter being on packaging waste. I am surprised that action has not been taken on a number of others, including the batteries directive, 91/157/EEC, given that these batteries, which I have in my hand, these little time bombs, are not disposable anywhere except in a dump in most of Ireland, except in Leinster House where they are collected. However, that is not accessible to everybody in the country.</P>
      <P>Nobody is saying the Minister's job is easy, but as Minister with responsibility for waste, it is critical for the well-being of people, environment and business here that we all get together and make the difference in reducing waste. The primary aim is to minimise waste, but we are increasing it by over 4% each year. That is the first failure and that goes right back to the Department.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the Minister is operating, through the Waste Management Act, a policy of regional integrated planning. There is a role for regional planning, but I would suggest, as helpfully as I can, that the plan falls down in that it says in section 22(3) that two or more local authorities may, in lieu of each of them making a waste management plan, jointly make a plan. However, if each local authority does not have to make a plan, there is a temptation to pass the buck, and that is what is happening.</P>
      <P>As a result we see articles like the one in <i>Foinse</i> entitled &ldquo;Plean Dramhaíola caite sa bhruscar&rdquo; agus tá neart altanna mar sin ar fud na h-áite na laethanta seo. I am serious and trying to be constructive and helpful in suggesting that we go back to this issue of local responsibility for waste, rather than leaving it to a region which results, for example, in a situation where areas in my constituency in Dublin North, which are currently flooded, are designated for the location of dumps or a single dump for the whole region. We must change our waste plan and our Waste Management Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The powers of the Minister are clearly stated in the Act, and they are wide-ranging. The include prohibiting, limiting or controlling waste, controlling its production or use, prohibiting the composition, production, importation, distribution, supply, sale, disposal or advertising of any product or substance, and even prohibiting the production of waste and requiring that packaging be designed, produced and used so as to be capable of being re-used. All those wonderful powers are being read by people who do not see it happening.</P>
    <P>Companies like Wellman International in County Meath, the Minister's constituency, recycles 3.5 million PEP plastic bottles per day. They are not getting those PEP bottles from Ireland but from all around Europe and they are crying out for deposits to be put on those containers, as with many other containers. When Glanbia did away with its glass bottle bank, I did not hear the Minister protest or require that it comply with the relevant Act, which would have prohibited the closure of those plants and required glass bottles to be used more widely, as they are in Cork.</P>
    <P>Many options and models are available to the Minister. I direct him to initially consider the zero waste strategies in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The Guelph system operated in Canada is a wet-dry system where not only 60% or 70% of waste but all waste is brought to a wet-dry waste collection point. I have a cutting from Guelph in Canada, which states it is a dirty job but workers appear to enjoy themselves at the waste facility. Since 1995 it has successfully diverted more than 70%&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are many models available and rather than adopt a megaphone diplomacy approach in calling on local authorities and everyone else to do the necessary work, I ask the Minister to convene a national conference to discuss the specifics of the changes that need to be made and where responsibility for that should lie.

      <P>The Minister is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this matter and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear the Deputy's view misrepresents the position on the current EU legal proceedings against Ireland. There is in fact no suggestion of any failure on our part to tackle the waste issue, and any such suggestion would be unfounded, given the focus that this Government has brought to bear on this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that is not correct. The European Commission has initiated court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1999, the European <Col N="1229" /> Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland before the European Court of Justice on the grounds that Ireland had failed to take all the measures necessary to comply with specified provisions of three related waste directives.</P>
      <P>Under these directives member states are required to draw up one or more waste management plans addressing specified requirements, to draw up separately or in the framework of their general waste management plans, plans for the management of hazardous waste, and to include in waste management plans a specific chapter on the management of packaging and packaging waste.</P>
      <P>These requirements are fully transposed into Irish legislation, by means of Part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and the Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997. Under this legislation, local authorities are required to make, jointly or otherwise, waste management plans in regard to their functional areas, which respect the relevant requirements of the above directives, while the Environmental Protection Agency is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan.</P>
      <P>To date, regional waste management plans have been adopted in respect of the Dublin and mid-west regions. Local authorities in the south east region, which have all adopted plans under the 1996 Act, are currently preparing a single regional plan. In the three other main regions, only five of the authorities involved have not yet adopted their regional waste plans. Nationally, 28 authorities have made plans under the 1996 Act, which satisfy European Union requirements, while six authorities currently have no such plan.</P>
      <P>If the case brought by the Commission is upheld, Ireland will be required to take the necessary measures to comply with a judgment of the court, that is, ensure satisfactory completion of the planning process. Failure to do so within a specified time limit may result in the imposition on Ireland of a lump sum or penalty payment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the position is clear. Local authorities have a legal responsibility for waste management planning. It is imperative that the six outstanding local authorities discharge this responsibility and complete the current strategic planning process as soon as possible. Once they do so, the issue of the European Union fines does not arise.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, we expect the four local authorities that have difficulties with their proposed regional plans to complete an effective planning process as soon as possible. In so doing, they should bear in mind the urgent need for a modern waste infrastructure, reflecting the waste hierarchy, to support continued economic development while protecting the environment.

    <P>If, after a short period, problems remain, the <Col N="1230" /> Minister will consider the various options open to him, including the use of powers immediately available under the 1996 Act, with a view to bringing this planning process to an early conclusion.

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this issue. There is an awareness of the need for and a commitment to the provision of more child care facilities throughout the country. Everyone recognises that there is a need for more facilities. While the Government targeted more money at this area recently, it does not appear to have been spent or allocated to any great degree, judging from replies to parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>It has emerged that there is a major problem regarding planning applications for child care facilities throughout the country. Quite a number of refusals for child care facilities by planners have been given and quite a number of temporary permissions, as opposed to final permissions, have been given. In a number of cases that have come to my attention, particularly in the Dublin area, decisions made have been contrary to the inspectors' reports on the facilities. Inspectors have recommended that permission should be given for the proposed facilities, but the planning authorities have decided that permission should not be given or that they should be given only temporary permission. Child care providers are concerned permission for their facilities with be withdrawn, in other cases they are encountering difficulties in getting permission and in other cases that have been referred to An Bord Pleanála permission has been refused.</P>
      <P>This must be set in the context of draft planning guidelines issued by the Department earlier in the year for the development of child care facilities. I refer to the consultation draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities. They state specifically that development plans should include proposals for child care facilities and other community development projects. That is important because too many housing estates have been without facilities for children and families. Too much development has taken place without taking account of community needs. These guidelines are a welcome development regarding the land use planning aspects of child care provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current providers are uncertain about the current position and those considering establishing facilities wonder if it is worth the bother of trying to get planning permission. Will the Minister of <Col N="1231" /> State outline the scale of this problem? Has it been brought to his attention or to the attention of the Department? Can he indicate the number of refusals for permission for facilities throughout the country given by planning authorities and the number of refusals given by An Bord Pleanála? We need an overall picture of the position. If the Minister of State does not have those figures, perhaps he would organise to obtain them.</P>
    <P>If provision of a service for community facilities is included in the guidelines and will be included in the regulations when they are issues, what is happening at present? Why are planning authorities not taking the guidelines into account? There have been many examples of cases where they apparently have not been taken into account. A discussion on this area is required. What are the planning issues that need to be discussed? What criteria need to be in place regarding the development of child care facilities, as there are different rights and obligations on both sides. We need to be clear on what those are from a planning perspective. Can the Minister of State tell us when the new guidelines will be issued to local authorities and to An Bord Pleanála? What action will the Minister take to monitor their effectiveness? Can the Minister of State outline the position that applies at present and what action can be taken to resolve it, as it must be resolved if we intend to ensure the removal of the stress faced by parents due to the shortage of places and if we are to ensure there is a greater supply of child care facilities throughout the country. They can operate very well and in a way that does not affect anyone else. Will the Minister of State move with all possible haste to put new guidelines in place and to monitor their implementation by local authorities and by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot respond to this matter and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Government policy on child care is to increase the number of child care places available and to improve the quality of child care services for the community. In pursuance of this policy, the Minister published draft guidelines on child care facilities for planning authorities, for public consultation in May this year. The consultation period has now elapsed and the submissions received by the Department during the public consultation process are being considered with a view to publishing final guidelines next January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft guidelines explicitly acknowledged that planning permission for child care facilities had been identified as an area of concern in child care service development. The draft guidelines are intended to address this concern by ensuring a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities and to identify the planning issues appropriate to child care facilities. The final guidelines will be issued as ministerial guidelines <Col N="1232" /> under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which has been commenced with effect from 1 November 2000. Section 28 requires that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála shall have regard to any such ministerial guidelines in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans and will also be of interest to developers, builders and child care service providers. The guidelines will also assist planning authorities in fulfilling the requirement under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, that the provision of services for the community, including créches and other child care facilities, must be included as an objective in development plans. This provision will apply from 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The production of the guidelines had been recommended in the Report of the Expert Working Group on Childcare established under the terms of Partnership 2000. The draft guidelines were prepared by a committee of officials from my Department, the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, local authority planning departments, An Bord Pleanála and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The guidelines will enable planning authorities to ensure the proper planning and development of their areas while meeting the identified need for additional child care provision.</P>
    <P>The draft guidelines recommend that planning authorities should include in their development plans policies and objectives for the provision of child care facilities. The guidelines specify a variety of locations that are considered to be appropriate for child care facilities, including larger housing estates, industrial estates and other employment centres, in the vicinity of schools and in neighbourhood and district centres. The guidelines outline general criteria which should be considered by planning authorities in assessing an application for a child care facility such as size and nature of the facility, the benefits that could accrue to the area from the facility, etc. Submissions on the draft guidelines have been made to the Department by a variety of relevant interests including An Bord Pleanála, planning authorities, health boards, child care service providers, the Irish Planning Institute and the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland. These submissions are being considered carefully in the Department and will be fully taken into account in the finalisation of the guidelines. In view of the importance of the issue and the advanced state of the guidelines, when issuing the draft guidelines the Minister asked planning authorities to take the guidelines on board straight away. I assure the Deputy that the Government is taking every action to ensure that the planning system does not stand in the way of the development of much-needed child care facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Minister is statutorily prohibited from getting involved in individ<Col N="1233" /> ual cases. He is aware of recent press coverage on refusal of planning permission for child care facilities. The coverage did not deal with the facilities for which planning permission was granted. It is in all our interests that proper planning standards are adhered to. The draft guidelines address the issues arising from the need to increase child care provision while following proper planning principles. We are confident they will lead to a better understanding of all these issues by all interested parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to hark back to the appalling blunder which was made this time last year which stopped all issue of taxi licences but I wish to alert the Minister to the serious situation now emerging since the court judgment which followed that blunder.</P>
      <P>Everyone has a different interpretation of what the judgment means &ndash;  the taxis, the hackneys, the corporation, the public and we have heard them all. However, nobody knows what the Minister of State's interpretation is and he has to move now to clarify that. This court case has gone on for a full year and during that time there was adequate opportunity to decide and plan a response, no matter what the outcome of the case. I fully accept that we are now in a legal minefield, with appeal and counter-appeal threatened by all sides, but such threats should not dictate Government policy or allow any deviation from what should be the only agenda: the provision of a service to the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State simply cannot adopt a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; attitude, in case there is an appeal or because any new method of licence issue might itself be appealed. There will be appeals but it is not the responsibility of the taxi drivers, the hackneys or the courts to determine or dictate policy. That is the responsibility of the Minister of State and he must now clearly state how he intends to back out of the cul de sac he has created for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of clarity and the lack of certainty is already resulting in the loss of taxis on the streets of Dublin. The second half of the fees for licences issued in 1999 are now due and drivers in some cases are refusing to pay because they believe future licences may well be entirely free. They may be right, but the result is their licences are being withdrawn. In other cases the banks, looking at an entirely uncertain taxi market, are refusing to loan the £7,500 required. I find that somewhat ironic as apparently they had no difficulty loaning £80,000 to allow very ill-advised investment into a taxi market that has been clearly unsustainable for some years. More seriously, the lack of clarity about the Minister of State's intentions is leading to heightened tensions between the hackney and taxi drivers. This tension has already boiled over into violence: as recently as last night a taxi driver was beaten up and had his car damaged to the point of being written off. I <Col N="1234" /> fear that this will not be the end of the violence unless the situation is clarified.</P>
    <P>On Sunday, taxi drivers from all over the country will have a mass meeting in the National Stadium. The hackney drivers are planning some kind of confrontation for later in the month which I find more than worrying. The very least we can expect to see is city centre street demonstrations which will clog up the city in the run up to Christmas and if I were the Minister I would not wish to visit that kind of disruption on the public. If there are tensions in the industry, it is nothing to the tension and stress being experienced by the taxi-using public who now face another winter and Christmas without additional taxis, if not with fewer than before. What they are feeling is more than road rage or DART rage. It is fury. They are furious that this Government cannot get a handle on the situation.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of cars available and thousands of drivers available for them. The only barrier so far has been vested interests, as the Tánaiste said today. If so, why has she sat back for a year and allowed the Taoiseach to delay and pander to those same interests. It is a time for leadership &ndash; for the Minister of State to state clearly what he intends to do and that should not be dictated by threats of demonstrations, compensation or threats of litigation. The only agenda must be to sort this industry out once and for all, to put an end to abuses and bring in a system which provides enough taxis to meet the needs of the public, accessible cars of a high standard, driven by drivers who have the necessary qualifications and who can produce tax clearance and RSI forms annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for raising this important matter. I wish to emphasise that the Government remains strongly committed to improving Dublin and other taxi services for the benefit of all concerned. Every effort is being made to provide for an increase in Dublin taxi licence numbers as quickly as possible, with due regard to the recent High Court determination.</P>
      <P>A greater increase in Dublin taxi licence numbers has already taken place during this Government's term of office than under any other Government for more than 20 years. While this increase of 750 in the Dublin taxi fleet is welcome, the Government acknowledges, as evidenced by its initiative for a doubling of Dublin taxi numbers, that a much greater supply of taxis is needed to meet public demand.</P>
      <P>While the way forward has been complicated by the current judicial review, the direction and resolve of the Government's proposed reforms is not altered. Detailed examination and analysis of the court decision is now taking place as a matter of urgency in my Department with a view to providing a workable basis for the resumption of new taxi licensing. I am confident that measures can and will be put in place with minimum delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> The motion refers to difficulties with the renewal of taxi licences. I am advised that the recent High Court judgment has no bearing on the renewal of existing taxi licences. As far as my Department is aware, such renewals are continuing to be processed by local authorities in the normal way. The Government has adopted a progressive and ambitious stand for improving Dublin taxi services. Our proposals for increasing taxi numbers go far beyond those advocated by the Deputy's party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The one parent family payment is a means tested payment which is intended to assist a lone parent who is bringing up a child or children without the support of a partner. In order to qualify for the one parent family payment, an applicant must satisfy a number of statutory conditions. He or she must have the main care and charge of at least one child, must not be cohabiting, must if earning, have gross earnings of less than £230.76 per week, equivalent to £12,000 per annum, and must satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>In addition, in appropriate cases, it is necessary to establish that efforts have been made to obtain maintenance from the former spouse or partner before a payment can be put into effect.</P>
      <P>My Department has, as a priority obligation, to provide the best possible service to claimants under the various schemes and to process new claims in the fastest possible times. Over the past 12 months, the average number of weeks to decide a claim was 9.9 weeks in the case of claims from unmarried claimants and 13.8 weeks in the case of claims from separated claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of new one-parent family payments claims has been increasing significantly over recent years and is currently averaging around 18,000 per annum &ndash; equivalent to about 350 per week. Also, due to significant improvements in the earnings exemptions for lone parents, more clients are remaining on one-parent family payment for a longer period. Due to the relatively young age profile and social circumstances of this group, they are more likely to move in and out of employment, education or training on a regular basis or to have other changes in their circumstances. This is a very positive development for lone parents but it requires significant work on revising existing claims each year to take account of these changes. Approximately 52,000 existing cases are expected <Col N="1238" /> to have to be reviewed at the clients' instigation this year.</P>
    <P>A number of developments are under way to address this situation. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive review of its administrative staffing requirements and work priorities in its pension services office &ndash; where the one-parent family payment scheme is administered &ndash; to reflect the growing new claim and revision workload there.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and following on from the expenditure review of the one-parent family payment which was published in September 2000, it is intended to devolve the administration of the one parent family payment to the Department's network of local offices around the country. This development of the scheme is aimed primarily at making it more accessible to lone parents. It will also be of value in helping lone parents to access information about employment, education and training opportunities in their own area, through my Department's local employment support services. I would expect that this devolution of administration should assist in reducing claim processing times through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network.</P>
    <P>A large majority of one-parent family payment applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. The main form of such support is supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance while some would be in receipt of maternity benefit, unemployment benefit or disability benefit. This does not obviate the need to provide an efficient, courteous and speedy claim processing service to all one parent family payment applicants. I believe that the measures now being reviewed will bring about a measurable improvement in the quality and timeliness of service to one-parent family payment applicants in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In August I launched a report on phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. It also sets out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform. The main proposals outlined in phase 1 of the review are: that a switch be accepted, in principle, from the current yearly average test to a system based on a total contributions approach whereby title to pension would be determined by the total number of contributions paid and credited during a person's working life; a switch be accepted, in principle, from the current system of disregards under the home<Col N="1239" /> maker's scheme to a credits based approach; that further recognition be given to contributions paid prior to 1953; and that improvements be made to the old age contributory-retirement pensions, reduced rates bands with a view to simplifying and rationalising these.</P>
      <P>The results of the review were anticipated in relation to the last two recommendations mentioned, for example, further recognition of pre-53 contributions and rationalising of old age contributory-retirement pensions rate bands. Some 38,000 pensioners have benefited by the rationalising of the old age contributory pension rates structure with overall increases in weekly personal rates of pension ranging between £7.50 and £12.20.</P>
      <P>Almost 2,600 new pensions have been awarded as a result of the further recognition now being afforded to pre-53 social insurance contributions with many people on <i>pro rata </i>pensions also having their position improved.</P>
      <P>My Department is still processing applications for these new pensions.</P>
      <P>The proposed switch towards a system based on total contributions represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy.</P>
      <P>Such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public.</P>
      <P>The current system is based on the average level of contributions made each year over a person's working life and this has given rise to anomalies and problems.</P>
      <P>Much work needs to be done before such a system could be introduced.</P>
      <P>In particular, the appropriate level of contributions required for a pension needs to be determined and transitional arrangements will also have to be put in place.</P>
      <P>These issues will be examined in the second phase of this review.</P>
      <P>The report also examined the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in 1994.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme periods spent caring for children or disabled relatives can be disregarded when a person's PRSI record is being assessed for old age contributory-retirement pension purposes. The review proposed that, in principle, the disregard approach should be replaced with one based on credited contributions.</P>
      <P>The operative date of the homemaker's scheme was also examined and it was considered that there is no fundamental reason, in principle, why the homemaker provisions should only apply from 1994.</P>
      <P>It was recognised that there are significant difficulties and cost considerations in determining an appropriate alternative earlier date. I am considering further the options.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. To assist in its implementation, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing which were distributed to all Departments last year and which have been published in the two annual reports of the national anti-poverty strategy interdepartmental policy committee. Worked examples of poverty proofing exercises were also distributed to Departments last year and are available on request from my Department.</P>
      <P>All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998. Key principles of the national anti-poverty strategy are built into the development of the social welfare budget package from the start and influence the development throughout.</P>
      <P>Documents outlining the proofing of the social welfare budget package will be available to anyone who expresses an interest from budget day, as they were last year. The Minister for Finance has already assured this House that the income tax provisions in the forthcoming budget will be poverty proofed having regard to the official guidelines on the matter. Responsibility for poverty proofing of expenditure measures rests with spending Departments.</P>
      <P>All Departments are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. This means that records held by the Departments, including records in relation to poverty proofing, are accessible to members of the public, subject only to certain specific exemptions placed within the Act by the Oireachtas. Poverty proofing records are therefore fully accessible, subject only to these exemptions.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council is currently undertaking an independent study of the poverty proofing process.</P>
      <P>I expect that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a copy of the Combat Poverty Agency's pre-budget submission. This is one of the many budget submissions which I have received from a broad range of representative organisations, community and voluntary organisations and other interested groups.</P>
      <P>The agency is recommending that the forthcoming budget should target resources towards low income households, particularly those with children.</P>
      <P>It has proposed an overall budget package costing in the region of £1.46 billion, to be divided equally between tax cuts and improved welfare provision. The main proposals include: indexing tax and welfare payments in line with wage increases in 2000; providing additional improvements for households on the  lowest welfare payments; targeting surplus resources at low and middle income  households with children; providing an equitable system of support for the child care costs of families; and bringing forward welfare increases, including child benefit, to the start of the year.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an inclusive society, where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country, is a fundamental objective of this Government. In formulating proposals for inclusion in the 2001 budget, therefore, the Government will be endeavouring to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are invested in our social infrastructure to bring our social services up to the best standards.</P>
      <P>The Government's action programme and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contain a wide range of commitments relating to the areas for which I have responsibility, including commitments: to provide for substantial increases in social welfare payment rates, including increasing the old age contributory pension to £100 per week by 2001 and increasing all other old age pensions to £100 by 2002; to make substantial progress over the period to 2003 towards a target rate of £100 per week for the lowest social welfare rates; and to substantially increase child benefit over the period up to 2003, with a priority focus towards £100 a month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the improvements provided for in the past three budgets, substantial progress has already been made in relation to some of the above commitments. For instance, last year's social welfare improvements package, which is the biggest ever additional allocation amounting to over £428 million on a full year basis, provides for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66. This increase means that substantial progress has <Col N="1242" /> been made towards the commitment to increase all old age pensions to £100 by 2002.</P>
    <P>My priorities for budget 2001 will include making further progress towards implementing the various programme commitments outlined above and responding where possible to the various concerns brought to my attention during the course of the budget process, having regard to the available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 21, 27, 30, 40, 45, 117, 119, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnrod Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin.</P>
      <P>The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services and noted that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
      <P>The review notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not obliged to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be <Col N="1244" /> mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles.</P>
    <P>The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy.</P>
    <P>Proposals to address the rural transport deficit are being considered further by the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Surveys conducted as part of the review showed that there is overwhelming support for retaining the free schemes, including the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>It established that the free schemes are effective in the alleviation of poverty, in the promotion of social inclusion for those who are eligible and in need, and in assisting older people to remain active and independent in their own communities.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in particular, is seen by many as a recognition of older people's contribution to society.</P>
    <P>With regard to free travel companion passes, these passes have been available since 1990 to certain people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    <P>The review examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to other people with disabilities and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass holders are quite capable of travelling alone.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs.</P>
    <P>In view of the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a free travel companion pass should be issued to all people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone. This would standardise the qualifying conditions for a companion pass for both invalidity pension and disability allowance.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of long-term disability type payments are eligible for the free schemes.</P>
    <P>Those in receipt of disability benefit do not qualify for the free schemes as this payment is generally short-term in nature. Those people who are in receipt of disability benefit for more than 12 months and who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible to transfer to invalidity pension which would entitle them to claim the free schemes.</P>
    <P>The review recommended that the free schemes should not be extended to recipients of payments which are short-term in nature.</P>
    <P>In Budget 2000, I extended the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of income or household composition. It is estimated that extending the free schemes, on the same <Col N="1245" /> basis, to those who are aged 72 years and over could cost in the region of £8.5 million annually.</P>
    <P>The review noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the free telephone rental allowance, Eircom ran a promotion in 1996, with the co-operation of the Department, offering a reduced installation fee of £50 to 16,392 social welfare pensioners. This group was targeted on the basis of being in receipt of a living alone allowance but not in receipt of a free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1997, some 2,200 had availed of the offer and 1,962 had applied to the Department for a free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>The review considered that the Government's policy of care in the community should support measures to ensure that pensioners are not deprived of a telephone because of inadequate income or perceived fear of costs. In view of the increased revenue which would accrue to Eircom, apart from any social obligation, the review considered that Eircom could provide free installation to the remaining group of pensioners.</P>
    <P>The review also examined the issue of extending the free schemes to include other items of expenditure, including the cost of cable television. The review considers that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package of necessary household benefits that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group.</P>
    <P>It notes that it is not the business of this Department to provide for all socially desirable items of expenditure. The review recommended that no further goods and services be covered by the free schemes.</P>
    <P>Following previous demands for concessions on the cost of cable television, my officials wrote to the cable company concerned bringing the demands for such concessions to their attention.</P>
    <P>The report examines a large number of issues and requires detailed consideration.</P>
    <P>I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Out of Sight &ndash; The Hidden Poverty of Women, published recently by the National Women's Council, is a welcome initiative to ensure that the full extent of women's poverty can be identified and addressed.</P>
      <P>Women are at a significant risk of poverty and some predominantly female groups, such as lone parents, are at a very high poverty risk. The Government is strongly committed to eliminating poverty for all our people, including women and children. One of the main principles underlying the national anti-poverty strategy is the reduction of inequalities and in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty.</P>
      <P>Women's poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As part of the review, existing national anti-poverty strategy targets will be revised as appropriate and consideration will be given to possible new targets under the themes of women's poverty, child poverty, older people, health and housing and accommodation. Working groups are currently being established, with representation from the social partners, towards this end.</P>
      <P>The programme also underlines the need to improve data and data collection systems for the monitoring and evaluation of poverty, including new studies to address the gender dimension of poverty. A meeting has taken place between representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland and officials of my Department with a view to addressing the need for improved data for policy making and work is under way to ensure that groups who are currently not included in the poverty figures, such as Travellers and the homeless, are fully recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is taking a number of practical steps to address key issues of relevance to women. Earlier this year I launched a report on women's access to labour market opportunities. I recently launched a review of our one-parent family payment which sets out a range of measures to improve parent's income. Substantial progress has been made in the last three budgets towards meeting our commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 by 2002. We are also introducing carer's leave and benefit, and investing £290 million in developing child-care to make work more family friendly. The Government is committed to improving the immediate financial position of women and to enhancing the <Col N="1247" /> possibility for women of all ages to achieve economic independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>On taking office, this Government set ambitious goals in order to secure the future of our older people, one of which was a commitment to bring the old age contributory pension up to £100 per week over the lifetime of the Government, that is, by the year 2002.</P>
      <P>This Government committed itself, in last year's review of the programme, to the early achievement of the £100 commitment and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions by 2002.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has already been made in this regard. In the three budgets since taking office, the Government has moved towards achieving the £100 target rate. The personal rate of old age contributory pension has been increased by £18.00 to £96.00 per week, while the rate for a married couple has been increased by £27.20 to £160.40 per week. The equivalent rates for old age non-contributory pension have been increased by £18.00 to £85.50 per week and by £29.70 to £137.20 per week respectively.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group is being established which will have a mandate to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. This will include their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns. It is envisaged that the working group will also take account of work being carried out to review the underlying methodology of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>A chairperson for the group has now been appointed and the social partners and relevant Departments have been invited to formally nominate their representatives to the group.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the programme, there are complex issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the senior citizens parliament cites earnings as a possible index, this is just one of a num<Col N="1248" /> ber of options that may be available for recommendation by the group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>I expect that the Deputy is referring to the National Economic and Social Forum opinion No. 8, which commented that a quarter of children live in households below half average income and that Irish children have the highest rate of income poverty in the EU. Based on 1997 figures, this places Ireland in a similar position to the UK and Portugal in relation to income poverty.</P>
      <P>The most recent independent survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute shows that the level of consistent poverty among children has dropped to 12% &ndash; a fall of almost 30% in the 12 month period from 1997 to 1998. Behind these statistics is an improvement in the quality of life for another 50,000 of our children. This accelerates the downward trend in child poverty figures with consistent poverty among children being halved from 24.8% in 1987 to 12% in 1998.</P>
      <P>The massive drop in consistent child poverty is largely attributable to this Government's success in reducing unemployment to under 4% by creating work friendly policies and providing the supports unemployed people need to get into the job market and get their share of our success.</P>
      <P>Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce, benefiting the individuals themselves and the families and communities in which they live.</P>
      <P>Last year's budget provided substantial increases all round for those on social welfare but especially in child benefit, where approximately one quarter of last year's budget increases went into child benefit.</P>
      <P>I look forward to fully meeting the commitment we gave in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness by further increasing child benefit with a target of £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As part <Col N="1249" /> of the review, existing national anti-poverty strategy targets will be revised as appropriate and consideration will be given to possible new targets under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, older people, health, and housing/ accommodation. Working groups are currently being established, with representation from the social partners, towards this end and the process is due to be completed by next summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's priority is to extend supplementary pensions coverage overall, especially to people who have no such cover at present, and the personal retirement savings account, recommended by the Pensions Board in its report securing retirement income, resulting from the national pensions policy initiative, is seen as the vehicle for achieving this objective.</P>
      <P>When the report was published, on my recommendation, the Government set up a number of working groups, comprising representatives from the relevant Departments and the Pensions Board, to progress the various proposals put forward by the Pensions Board.</P>
      <P>One of these groups, which was chaired by my Department, specifically examined the issues surrounding the introduction and regulation of PRSAs. One of the key features of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill which I plan to publish early next year will be the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction and regulation of PRSAs.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention that an effective awareness and education programme regarding pension provision will be undertaken in conjunction with the introduction of PRSAs.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness concluded earlier this year includes a commitment from employers and trade unions to promote the introduction of occupational pension schemes for those employees without access to such schemes, subject to the costs involved not undermining competitiveness and employment in enterprises.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions to be contained in the forthcoming pensions Bill, especially those relating to the introduction of PRSAs, combined with the commitments of the social partners in this area, will give a firm basis for meeting our objective of increased supplementary pension coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the introduction of PRSAs, the posi<Col N="1250" /> tion will be kept under review, including surveys of pension coverage, to ensure that we monitor the position and take any further action that may be required.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual at any one time.</P>
      <P>This is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual.</P>
      <P>An exception to this rule is made in the case of widows, widowers and other lone parents who are sick or unemployed. Where a person who is in receipt of a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment benefit at half rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their pension. Furthermore, if they are entitled to a widow or widower's pension or one parent family payment at a reduced rate, that is on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on means grounds, the rate of that payment is increased to the maximum level for the duration of their claim for disability or unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>These provisions discriminate positively in favour of widowed people and other lone parents. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the current arrangements for payment of disability or unemployment benefit in addition to widow or widower's pension are reasonable.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group is being established which will have a mandate to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. This will include their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns. It is envisaged that the working group will also take account of work being carried out to review the underlying methodology of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> A chairperson for the group has now been appointed and the social partners and relevant Departments have been invited to formally nominate their representatives to the group.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the programme, there are complex issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments. While the Deputy cites earnings as a possible index, this is just one of a number of options that may be available for consideration by the group. The Government recognises that the higher than expected inflation level this year has had the effect of reducing the value of the last budget's increases in social welfare payments. I can assure the House, that the Government will take careful account of the recent increased level of inflation in determining the appropriate level of social welfare increases for 2001.</P>
    <P>As regards indexation policy beyond this, however, it would not be appropriate to pre-empt discussions of the group that has been set up to look at this complex issue specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in section 205 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as amended, and in regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997, I have made a number of improvements to the provisions relating to late social welfare claims.</P>
      <P>For instance, prior to 1997 arrears of contributory pension claims were limited to either three months or six months before the date of claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under new provisions that came into operation in February 1998, the period for which such <Col N="1252" /> arrears can be paid in full was extended to 12 months and, where a claim under these schemes is more than 12 months late, the period of payment is extended on a proportional basis.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of other schemes for a period of six months prior to the date of claim provided there was good cause for the late claim.</P>
    <P>The legislation now also provides for relaxation of the restrictions on backdating late claims under all schemes apart from unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, and for further payment to be made, up to the level of full retrospection where the circumstances would warrant it, where: the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department, or illness or a <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier or the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
    <P>Regulations made by me earlier this year put on a statutory basis certain extra statutory provisions that had applied in the case of late claims under certain schemes. All late claims are now determined in accordance with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to late claims have been subjected to very close scrutiny in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is a general obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. Cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and the requirements of sound financial management and control of public expenditure and, on the other hand, the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 39 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The value placed on the child benefit scheme by this Government is reflected in the level of resources invested in the scheme over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget provided for a full year investment of over £40 million, while the most recent budget provides for a full year investment of almost £106 million, bringing total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million annually. Some 491,000 families with a total of 967,000 children benefited from these increases.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the child benefit scheme will continue to be strengthened, as a key instrument in tackling child poverty and targeting resources at those families most in financial need. In particular, because it is a universal payment which is not taxable or assessed as means for other secondary benefits, it does not contribute to disincentives to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>To this end, the Government has made a commitment to substantially increase the payment over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children. From September last, the basic child benefit monthly rates were increased to £42.50 per month in respect of each of the first two children and £56 per month in respect of the third and subsequent children, in line with this commitment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the timing of child benefit increases, it should be noted that the effective payment date of the increase coincides with the start of the school year in September and the increased financial burden faced by parents at this time. Moreover, approximately 40% of children are in families who are in receipt of weekly social welfare payments, and will have benefited from the Government's policy of bringing forward increases in weekly social welfare rates.</P>
      <P>Next year, general social welfare increases will be paid in April to coincide with the start of the tax year. In 2002, in line with the change of the tax year to the calendar year, the effective payment date of social welfare increases will be brought forward to January &ndash; a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office.</P>
      <P>The issue of the effective date of child benefit increases falls for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>This cost of bringing the increases in monthly child benefit provided for in the 1999 budget forward by three months from September to June would have amounted to over £10.2 million.</P>
      <P>To implement the increases in monthly child benefit provided for in the 2000 budget four months earlier, in May 2000, would have cost in the region of £35.28 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that the Deputy is referring to the document Poverty and Social Welfare prepared by the Conference of Religious in Ireland in advance of budget 2001, which criticised the use of the consistent poverty measure.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the national anti-poverty strategy set out a number of goals to be achieved over a ten year period from 1997 to 2007, including targets in relation to income adequacy. Chief among the strategy's objectives was a reduction in the numbers living in consistent poverty from 9% to 15% of the population, in 1994, to less than 5% to 10% of the population by the year 2007. The latest data available, in respect of 1998, shows that 6% to 8% of the population are living in consistent poverty, so we are well on our way to achieving our revised target of below 5% by 2004.</P>
      <P>There is no single best way to measure poverty. No one method can provide all the answers. The document referred to by the Deputy recognises that income alone does not tell the whole story concerning living standards and command over resources, and that it is necessary to look more broadly at a person's exclusion from the life of society because of lack of resources. This is particularly the case in trying to capture trends in poverty in a situation of very rapid growth in average incomes such as we are currently experiencing in this country. Direct measures of deprivation provide a valuable and complementary source of information in measuring poverty and assessing poverty trends.</P>
      <P>The NAPS poverty target defines consistent poverty as being below 50% to 60% of average household income and experiencing enforced basic deprivation. This, as the Deputy will know, is based on independent research from the ESRI. Eight basic items were identified by the Economic and Social Research Institute in its 1987 household survey, e.g. two pairs of strong shoes, a warm waterproof coat etc. These items are selected by the respondents themselves as basic necessities but which they are unable to afford.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute, supported by my Department, keeps the deprivation index under regular review to ensure that it remains relevant to people's perception of necessities. The indicators were most recently examined in June 1999 in relation to the 1997 living in Ireland survey and an examination in relation to the 1998 living in Ireland survey will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> We have also committed ourselves under the terms of Framework III of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to updating the underlying methodology of the national anti-poverty strategy in consultation with the relevant actors, reviewing the existing targets and considering new targets. In addition, a working group, with an independent chairperson, is to be established shortly to examine benchmarking and indexation issues and the issue of relative income poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Over recent years the trend in general government current expenditure as a percentage of national income or gross national product has been declining, reflecting the country's strong economic performance since the mid 1990's. While actual general Government current expenditure has been increasing during this period, because of the exceptionally strong economic performance, GNP has been increasing at an even faster pace.</P>
      <P>In addition, economic and demographic improvements during the period have meant that expenditure on certain government programmes has been decreasing. For instance, the major fall of about 115,000, 45%, in the live register since this Government took office has led to substantial reductions in overall expenditure on unemployment payments, which has fallen by almost 41% from £1,011 million in 1996 to an estimated £598 million this year. This fall in expenditure has occurred despite the significant increases in the rates of payment which have been provided over the period.</P>
      <P>In line with these developments in overall Government expenditure, the trend in social welfare expenditure as a percentage of gross national product has also been declining in recent years. This is a trend that is mirrored in many of the other EU member states. Expenditure is usually expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product for international comparison purposes. Comparisons based on national income or GNP would result in a more favourable placing for Ireland because unlike other countries, there is a significant disparity between GNP and GDP here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the benefits of economic growth generally are shared with the more vulnerable sections of our society so that all citizens have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and <Col N="1256" /> economic life of the country. The social welfare system has a central role to play in this regard and the Government has substantially increased total annual social welfare expenditure since 1997 by almost £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Last year's social welfare improvements, costing over £428 million on a full year basis, represented the biggest ever increase in social welfare allocation. To put this investment into context, it represents an increase of £214 million, or double the social welfare allocation in the 1997 budget which was introduced by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Going forward, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for further substantial increases in the resources to be allocated towards social inclusion measures &ndash; an additional £1,500 million. is to be provided over period up to 2003.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Government is also setting aside a portion of the benefits of the current economic success to underpin the future viability of our pensions system thereby ensuring the living standards of our older population in the years to come. To this end a national pensions reserve fund is being established and some £5 billion has already been allocated towards the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>This occurs in the case of asylum seekers in direct provision who are being provided with full board accommodation, all meals and other services. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have set up a working group comprising representatives from relevant Departments to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. The terms of reference of the working group are to review the <Col N="1257" /> existing arrangements for the payment of basic weekly supplementary welfare allowance to people who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs; to review the circumstances in which people claiming supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement are refused on the grounds that they are not in need of accommodation; and to consult with interested parties and to make appropriate recommendations.</P>
    <P>Membership of the working group consists of nominees of the health boards, the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in addition to representatives of my Department, which is chairing the group.</P>
    <P>One of the issues being examined by the group is what are the most suitable administrative arrangements for paying asylum seekers in direct provision. Supplementary welfare allowance is intended to be a short-term intervention to provide a safety net ensuring that no person is forced to live without the minimum level of resources set out in legislation. Apart from small numbers of people in exceptional circumstances, it was never intended that any category of people would have to rely on supplementary welfare allowance payments for a prolonged period because of the absence of alternative arrangements to meet their particular needs.</P>
    <P>In that context, the working group is considering whether the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the most appropriate mechanism for providing the weekly payment to asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation centres. The merits of possible alternative approaches, such as setting up a separate scheme or making the weekly payment in cash at the accommodation centre, are being considered.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the current administrative arrangements will at least maintain, if not improve on, the quality and level of service provided to the people concerned. There is no question of reducing the overall value of asylum seekers' entitlements to below the supplementary welfare allowance level. The supplementary welfare allowance system guarantees a minimum level of resources to every person in the State and this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the group's report and recommendations before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible, and recognises that people who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home may lose out in maintaining their social insurance record.</P>
      <P>For this reason, special arrangements are in place to assist those who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment, caring either for children aged up to six years or incapacitated people are ignored or disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements. The Social Welfare Act, 1996, extended the homemaker provisions by increasing the age of children being cared for from six to 12 years.</P>
      <P>For any year to be disregarded a homemaker must be out of the workforce for a complete year, 52 weeks, from 6 April 1994. The maximum period which can be disregarded is 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, <Col N="1259" /> earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
    <P>A total of 2,756 people are formally registered under the homemakers scheme, comprising mainly people caring for elderly-sick relatives who do not qualify for carer's allowance. Those caring for children would be certified through child benefit records and those who have applied for carer's allowance do not need to formally register for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Statistics regarding those currently ineligible for the homemakers scheme are not available.</P>
    <P>I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in the area of homemakers and, as I have previously indicated, I have ordered a review of the arrangements which are already in place. Accordingly, an examination of the homemakers scheme is being undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pensions and I will consider the issues further in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is specifically referring to the social insurance position of farm spouses, particularly in relation to entitlement to contributory old age pensions.</P>
      <P>There are no special provisions under the PRSI system in relation to women engaged in agriculture or women generally.</P>
      <P>In addition, the existing provisions apply equally to all other categories of self employed traders whose spouses work or assist in the family business.</P>
      <P>The social insurance status of spouses engaged in a family business, including farms, varies with the circumstances of the case. Spouses who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self employed contributors.</P>
      <P>Both make social insurance contributions and will be eligible, in due course, to qualify individually and in their own right for social insurance pensions.</P>
      <P>The legislation also provides that a person who is employed directly by his or her spouse is not covered by social insurance.</P>
      <P>Social insurance contributions are not due and the employed spouse is not covered for social insurance pensions. Likewise if a spouse participates in the business of a self-employed contributor, but is not a partner in the business, social insurance contributions are also not due and the participating or assisting spouse is not covered for social insurance pensions or benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> The PRSI status of farm women was considered by the Advisory Committee on the Role of Women in Agriculture which was established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>My Department was represented on this committee. Its report, published in September, recommended that action be taken now in order to ensure that both farming spouses have the option of gaining individual access to PRSI entitlements.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity of the issues, the committee recommended that a working group with legal, financial and technical expertise be established to further consider the development of models which will afford farm women financial recognition for their input into farming.</P>
    <P>It is also recommended that the working group should comprise of representatives of relevant Departments, including my Department, the farming social partners as well as women farmers.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the technical group is primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I understand that this matter will be progressed in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will be giving detailed consideration to the outcome of the examination when the findings are available.</P>
    <P>In addition, it will be necessary to consider any proposed changes to the existing arrangements for farm spouses in the wider context of the existing PRSI arrangements for other spouses who participate in non farming family businesses.</P>
    <P>The income tax arrangements which apply to farm spouses is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the community welfare service in the health <Col N="1261" /> boards. The scheme is currently being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations.</P>
    <P>The review is being undertaken by an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department and composed of representatives from my Department, the Departments of Finance and Health and Children and the health boards. The health board nominations were made by the chief executive officers. They are a general manager from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and a superintendent community welfare officer from the Mid-Western Health Board. Both have extensive experience in this area, having worked in the community welfare service for many years.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, it is not normal practice to have unions represented on interdepartmental working groups that are undertaking reviews of this nature with a view to preparing policy proposals for consideration by Government. In the circumstances, a request from SIPTU and IMPACT to be represented on the working group was not granted.</P>
    <P>Consultation with relevant organisations is an important feature of the reviews undertaken to date in my Department and the unions representing community welfare staff have been and will continue to be consulted by my officials during the entire course of the review. They are also being kept up to date on the progress of the review at regular meetings with my officials. The next such meeting is scheduled for 29 November.</P>
    <P>As part of the consultation process for this review some 140 submissions have been received including a joint submission from SIPTU and IMPACT as the unions representing the community welfare staff and a number of separate submissions from individual community welfare officers and groups of community welfare officers. All of these submissions are considered important by the working group.</P>
    <P>They will inform and contribute directly to the group's consideration of the future policy direction for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. It also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>I expect that the proposals of the interdepartmental working group will be finalised by the end of next year and I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment further on individual aspects of the submissions received, including the role of community welfare staff, while this review is ongoing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>There were 13,129 persons in receipt of family income supplement at the end of October 2000. The average weekly payment was £40.61.</P>
      <P>Data on the number of recipients who are employed in the civil or public service are not available.</P>
      <P>A working group has been established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems. This examination will include the possibility of paying FIS through the tax system. The two issues are closely related since a substantial number of FIS claimants have income which comes below the tax exemption limits appropriate to their family size. In order for such families to benefit from a tax credits system the payment would have to take the form of a refundable tax credit.</P>
      <P>The first meeting of the working group took place on 26 October. I understand that my Department provided the working group with a factual paper on the family income supplement scheme including relevant statistical data in order to inform their discussions.</P>
      <P>The group agreed that initial discussions would focus on the broader issue, that is, the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems. In this context, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are to produce a joint paper documenting additional options proposed by the social partners at the last meeting, for possible payment via a refundable tax credit mechanism. The members of the working group, including the representatives of Government Departments, will be requested to provide views on this paper in the next phase of the deliberative process.</P>
      <P>I look forward to seeing the progress report from the working group, which is due at the end of the year, and its final conclusions in due course. Obviously, measures which are capable of advancing the interests of low paid workers with families will be viewed positively by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, I will continue to explore the scope for further enhancements to the FIS scheme so that the value of the FIS payment as a <Col N="1263" /> financial incentive to workers on low pay is maintained.</P>

      <P>The preceding social welfare record of an offender continues to count towards his or her entitlement to contribution based social welfare payments, including pensions, following his or her release from prison.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the impact of regulations governing the award of PRSI credited contributions on certain persons, who have incurred a gap of two complete contribution years in their social welfare record, following a period in prison.</P>
      <P>Regulations provide for the award of PRSI credited contributions when an insured person is receiving certain social welfare payments, including unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or one parent family payment subject to certain restrictions. However, where there is a gap of two complete consecutive years in a person's PRSI employment contribution or credited contribution record, then no credited contributions may be awarded in respect of the person concerned until she or he has paid 26 PRSI employment contributions at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>The rationale for this measure centres on the general principle that there should be a reasonable link between entitlement to benefit and a recent participation in the labour force. To review this measure in the case of prisoners, would raise questions of equity <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories of persons who had been out of the labour force for various different reasons.</P>

      <P>Comhairle was established on 12 June 2000. It combines the National Social Service Board and certain functions of the </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National Rehabilitation Board. Comhairle is the national support agency responsible for the provision of information, advice and advocacy services to members of the public, including people with disabilities. It provides information and advice on the broad range of social services <i>via</i> the national network of citizens information <Col N="1264" /> centres and the citizens information database. Comhairle also provides a range of additional resources and supports to information providers in the voluntary and statutory sectors.</P>
    <P>Following its establishment, Comhairle, has made arrangements to deliver information services from its offices throughout the country to people who previously used the services of the National Rehabilitation Board. Comhairle continues to support the network of citizens information centres &ndash; 85 centres in all, 34 of which are being resourced to provide a full-time service. An access audit has been undertaken in relation to the 34 centres in the first instance and the next stage of that audit is an audit of the total network with a view to ensuring that all citizens information centres are accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>While much of Comhairle's energies recently have been engaged in making the new merged organisation a fully operational unit, it is also addressing the issue of additional information requirements in relation to disability, including targeted approaches that would ensure that those who are most marginalised could access the information they required. Currently there is a programme of education and training for CIC staff in the area of equality, including disability. Comhairle has also been involved in discussions with organisations in the disability area in relation to ideas about the current level of service and future development.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the network of citizens information centres will continue to be the main source of independent information and advice for all citizens including those with a disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that child dependant allowances will be extended to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The timing of the introduction of measures implementing this commitment over the period, will be determined in a budgetary context, having regard to Government priorities and the available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy direction followed by successive Governments since 1994 has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing child dependant allowances, thus ensuring that the supports provided <Col N="1265" /> by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent(s).</P>
    <P>The employment disincentive problems associated with child dependant allowances were highlighted particularly in the report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.</P>
    <P>Unlike CDAs, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test. The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. The 1999 budget provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million in the scheme, while the 2000 budget provided for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing the total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, the combined child benefit/child dependant allowance payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation. In terms of tackling work disincentives, the shift towards CB has been significant. For instance, in 1994, CB represented 29% of the total child benefit/child dependant allowance payment for a four child family, now it represents 47%.</P>
    <P>The policy of concentrating substantial additional resources on child benefit rather than increasing child dependant allowances is of course reflected in the Government's commitment on child benefit under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This places particular emphasis on making progress towards a rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent children over the lifetime of the programme. The Government is determined to fulfil this commitment.</P>

      <P>This Government has pledged itself to achieving a society based on social inclusion and to the elimination of poverty. While each Department retains the lead role in progressing policies under its own area, constant co-ordination of cross-departmental activity, with consultative mechanisms involving other agencies, where appropriate, is an important element of the national anti-poverty strategy which seeks to focus anti-poverty policy on those most in need, as efficiently and effectively as possible. Towards this end, administrative structures have been put in place, including: the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs, including local development, chaired by the Taoiseach, <Col N="1266" /> which now meets on a regular monthly basis. The Cabinet sub-committee ensures that strategic priorities are being pursued in relation to poverty and exclusion and provides strong political leadership to advance the goals of the strategy; the senior officials social inclusion group which supports the work of the Cabinet sub-committee; the national anti-poverty strategy interdepartmental policy committee, which discusses future plans and the progress of current activity, is comprised of senior officers who have responsibility for ensuring that the national anti-poverty strategy provisions relevant to their Departments are implemented and representatives of other relevant agencies, such as the Combat Poverty Agency; the national anti-poverty strategy unit based in my Department which co-ordinates and develops cross-departmental action in support of social inclusion; and the national anti-poverty strategy liaison officers in relevant Departments fulfil a communication and co-ordination role, particularly in relation to poverty proofing.</P>

      <P>Employers are required to deduct pay-related social insurance contributions from the wages of their employees. The PRSI contributions, which are a percentage of an employee's reckonable earnings, are normally payable by both the employer and the employee and remitted by the employer to the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance for transmission to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where non-compliance with PRSI legislation is reported, an inspector of my Department will examine the employer's employment records, the <Col N="1267" /> facts regarding the employment will be established and any PRSI arrears due will be assessed and collected or advised to the Revenue Commissioners. Social welfare inspectors will advise Revenue of outstanding PAYE matters which they uncover during the course of their employer inspection work.</P>
    <P>Where a benefit claim is affected or delayed due to the non-payment of PRSI contributions in respect of a period of employment, an inspector of my Department can, if he or she is satisfied that the employment took place, recommend that the employee's contribution record be credited as if the contributions had been paid, in order to facilitate payment of the benefit claimed.</P>
    <P>Where an employer has failed to pay PRSI contributions in respect of an employee or where an employer fails to comply with any requirement relating to the payment and collection of employment contributions, any benefit lost by an employee or any other person arising out of such failure is recoverable from that employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 116, 128, 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies' concerns in relation to the impact of inflation on people dependent on social welfare payments. As the Deputies will recall, the budget last December provided for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66; a special increase of £5.90 a week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years; and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66 years. The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%.</P>
      <P>Since this Government took up office, social welfare payments have been substantially increased in real terms. For example, social welfare pensioners aged 66 years and over have received total increases of between 23% and 27% compared with an increase of 11.2% in the cost of living during the same period.</P>
      <P>It is also clear that for many social welfare recipients and their families, the overall rate of increase in payment this year will be ahead of the increase in the cost of living. Pensioners who received the £7 increases are well ahead of inflation. In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances were provided this year, ranging from 8% to 17%. The budget also provided for significant increases of between 22% and 23% in monthly child benefit payments.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as part of our commitment to align the tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all of the increases were paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May. We have already announced that the increases will take place at the start of the tax year from April next. In addition, I recently announced that this alignment of tax and social welfare changes will be maintained when the tax year is changed to coincide with the calendar year in January 2002. Social welfare weekly rates will be increased from January in that year &ndash; a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office. This progressively earlier payment of increases has to be taken into account in assessing the real level of increases which have been provided by this Government over its period of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The higher than expected inflation has, of course, had the effect of reducing the real value of this year's budget increases in social welfare payments. The budget for next year the Government will be taking full account of the increased level of inflation in setting increases for 2001.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether an anomaly exist in that the spouses of farmers who are joint owners of the family farm are excluded from qualification for contributory old age pension when they have made an active input thereto and are then excluded from the qualified dependant allowance as a result of the income deemed to arise from the joint ownership; and the steps he will take to remedy this anomaly.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The PRSI status of women engaged in farming was considered by the advisory committee on the role of women in agriculture which was established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. My Department was represented on this committee. Its report, published in September, recommended that action be taken now in order to ensure that both farming spouses have the option of gaining individual access to PRSI entitlements. Given the complexity of the issues, the committee recommended that a working group with legal, financial and technical expertise be established to further consider the development of models which will afford farm women financial recognition for their input into farming. It is also recommended that the working group should comprise of representatives of relevant Departments, including my Department, the farming social partners and women farmers. The establishment of the technical group is primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I understand that this matter will be progressed in the near future.</P>
      <P>At present the social insurance status of spouses engaged in a family business, including farms, varies with the circumstances of the case. Spouses who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self-employed contributors. Both make social insurance contributions and will be eligible, in due course, to qualify individually and in their own right for social insurance pensions. If, however, a spouse participates in the business of a self-employed contributor, but is not a partner in the business, social insurance contributions are not due and the participating or assisting spouse is not covered for social insurance pensions or benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the payment of qualified adult allowances in cases where there is joint ownership of farms I am aware that difficulties have arisen. In such cases my Department assesses part of the income from the farm against <Col N="1270" /> the spouse and this may make them ineligible for a QAA. This is a very complex area which not only affects pension entitlements but also has implications for other schemes on which QAAs are paid. However, my Department is reviewing the basis on which these decisions are made and I expect that this work will be completed very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments.</P>
      <P>There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Exceptional needs payment are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>Urgent needs payments may be used to assist persons who would not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>For example, in the aftermath of a flood or a fire immediate needs such as food, clothing or household goods can be met where appropriate through the payment of urgent needs payments.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on exceptional needs payment was approximately £21.31 million in 1998, £21.86 million in 1999 and £18.88 million to date in 2000. Expenditure on urgent needs payments was £86,000 in 1998, £76,000 in 1999 and £71,000 to date in 2000. The top seven items of exceptional needs payments/urgent needs payments expenditure are as follows: household appliances, child clothing, rent deposits, furniture, adult clothing, funeral expenses and household bedding. A detailed analysis of expenditure in each of these years is contained in the attached tabular statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The review of the one-parent family payment published on 5 September <Col N="1274" /> 2000, is the first review of this scheme since it was introduced in January 1997. The review is one of a series being undertaken under the Department's expenditure review programme which was put in place as part of the strategic management initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of the review was the OFP scheme and the extent to which it achieves its objectives. The review paid particular attention to the needs of lone parents and their children generally and to the desire for this group to avoid long-term dependency on the social welfare system. It also examined various other issues relating <Col N="1275" /> to lone parenthood. The review provides valuable information which will form a basis for consideration of the future direction of OFP.</P>
    <P>On foot of the proposals in the review, I intend to introduce a number of policy initiatives as follows. The first major action programme that is being prepared relates to employment and education opportunities. I am concerned at the continued high poverty rates for lone parents and their children and at the fact that long-term welfare dependency has become a reality for many of those on OFP.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness we are committed to seeking reduction in poverty for children and women. Lone parenthood is a key issue for both and is one of the main contributors to the rates of consistent poverty which currently affect them.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the significant growth in the number of lone parents at work with about 60% of OFP recipients now having some level of earnings. I believe that this is the best route out of poverty. On foot of the proposals in the review and following discussions with the relevant agencies, I have been considering a range of measures to overcome the barriers to employment which currently exist.</P>
    <P>The pilot family services project which is currently under way in Cork, Waterford and Finglas, Dublin, has as its objective the provision of a high quality information service about the range of supports available to families from State and voluntary agencies, for example, in the areas of education, training and employment. This project is currently being reviewed and will be developed further in the light of this.</P>
    <P>I recently launched an information campaign to ensure that all lone parents are fully aware of the various supports and options which are available. This involved the sending of a newsletter to all one-parent family payment clients outlining the existing work, training and education opportunities available to them. However, the information campaign is only the first strand in a planned and comprehensive programme of measures which will form my Department's strategy to motivate, encourage and support lone parents to join the active labour force. The next phase of the programme, which will get under way shortly, will involve individual interviews for selected categories of lone parents, for example, those who will shortly lose entitlement to OFP because they will no longer have a qualified child in their household attendance at these interviews will, of course, be voluntary.</P>
    <P>The Department is developing plans for the localisation of the administration of the one parent family payment scheme. I believe that the devolvement of the administration of the OFP scheme to a local level will be an important step in helping to make the scheme itself and related services more accessible to lone parents.</P>
    <P>On the issue of maintenance, I believe that support from the &lsquo;absent' parent should play a much <Col N="1276" /> more important role in providing support to lone parents and increasing their overall income. The review sets out a comprehensive analysis of the options in this area which I am considering in detail.</P>
    <P>With regard to the income disregards which are a feature of the scheme and which are designed to help and encourage lone parents to consider training and employment as a viable option, I have no immediate plans to increase the level of these disregards. The review found that the disregards are adequate at present to support the level and nature of employment, much of which appears to be part-time, being undertaken by lone parents. The situation will be monitored and reviewed as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 7,685 persons in receipt of farm assist as of 3 November 2000, of whom 7,262 had other income assessed and were in receipt of appropriately reduced rates of payment. A residue of 225 claimants are still in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance pending completion of reviews of their entitlements. The average weekly payment to recipients of the former smallholders assistance payment is £92.88 and to new applicants £71.80. In 1999, total expenditure in respect of the farm assist scheme amounted to £15.6 million, while £13.8 million was paid out under the former smallholders unemployment assistance scheme. It is estimated that expenditure on the farm assist scheme will reach some £35 million by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>In relation to the numbers on the scheme, it should be borne in mind that the numbers receiving smallholders unemployment assistance had for various reasons declined from 9,900 in 1995 to 6,600 in 1998, that is by more than 1,000 per year. It seems likely that this decline would have continued so that the 7,900 now receiving payments reflects a significant reversal of the trend in numbers who benefit from support. Therefore, that the scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme has been well publicised through numerous press releases, extensive promotion by the farming organisations, coverage in both the national and farming media, advertising and State <Col N="1277" /> agencies such as Teagasc. Application forms are available in all my local offices.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, made a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. The child related disregards have been increased from £100 to £200 for the first two children and £200 to £300 for each subsequent qualified child.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, is now being taken into account in the assessment of means. There are also changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded, and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore. The effect of these changes is that the majority of farm assist claimants received an increase, from October, in their payment.</P>
    <P>The scheme clearly makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ask the Government to bring forward the 70% qualified adults personal allowance rate to 2001; and if he will make a statement on the further progress he is considering towards individualisation of social welfare rates.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to increasing the rate of qualified adult allowances over a three year period, to 70% of the personal rate. In budget 2000 increases in QAA rates ranged from almost 8% to 17% which brought them to between 60.5% and 67% of the personal rate. The position varies from scheme to scheme. Further progress will be made towards achieving the 70% target in the forthcoming budget, the extent of which will depend on the resources available and the Government's other priorities.</P>
      <P>Individualisation already exists to a certain extent within the social welfare system. In the social insurance system, those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right. In the old age non-contributory pension arrangements exist whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis &ndash; each person receives the same level of payment.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, published in August 1999, considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has already been achieved in this area over the last 12 years with coverage being <Col N="1278" /> extended to the self-employed in 1988, part-time workers in 1991 and new civil-public servants in 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means. In this regard a working group has been established under the programme to produce proposals to progress the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>This group comprises the social partners, the Department of Finance and is chaired by an official of my Department. The first meeting took place on the 19 October. Progress on administrative individualisation will be pursued in the light of the working group's proposals which I look forward to receiving in due course.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will respond to the recent steep increases in fuel costs by recommending the increase of the rate of the free fuel scheme to Government which has not been improved for 15 years.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April regardless of the temperature. The sum of £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year.</P>
      <P>In that regard, substantial increases were made in all the social welfare primary payments of either £4 or £7 which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, <Col N="1279" /> is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments which I have made. The Deputy will know that I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The application process for social welfare payments is designed to ensure that the various qualifying criteria in the relevant legislation are satisfied. To this end, a specific application form is provided for each payment which is designed to elicit the information needed and identifies the supporting documentation needed. In the case of widow/er's contributory pension, which is payable on the PRSI contributions of either the applicant or the deceased spouse, basic information is requested to identify the correct claimant, address, child dependants, date of death of the deceased person, preferred payment method and to locate the appropriate social insurance record, in order to determine the most appropriate and correct entitlement to pension. It is possible in the vast majority of cases to determine entitlement relatively easily on the basis of the information obtained in this way and by reference to the Department's computerised records dating from 1979.</P>
      <P>In a relatively small number of cases, delay arises because entitlement depends on older, re-computerised records or on employment for which contributions may not have been paid. My Department explores all possibilities in these cases to ensure that an applicant receives full entitlement in all cases where social insurance was or should have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislation, the widow/er of a deceased person who was in receipt of retirement <Col N="1280" /> or old age contributory pension has an automatic entitlement to widow/er's contributory pension. In these cases, the new pension is put into payment without the need for a separate application form.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in a very significant programme of change which will radically transform the means of access to and the delivery of the social welfare services. It is envisaged that, ultimately, persons making a claim to widow/er's pension will generally do so by way of the telephone system where the appropriate questions would be asked to elicit the information relevant to the particular case. Work on developing the computer systems and other changes to support these requirements is at a very early stage and it will take a number of years to implement all the changes. The objective is to make the service of the future much more focused on the customer's overall needs. I am confident that this process will result in a much better service to all our customers.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, every effort will be made to make the present service as effective and responsive as possible to peoples needs. A code of practice has been developed and is being implemented in the design of all of my Department's forms and leaflets to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. The application form for widow/er's pension is being reviewed in the light of this code to ensure simplification and ease of completion.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to delivering quality customer service and to ensuring continuous improvements in the standards of service it provides.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 27 April 2000 and had previously been in receipt of disability benefit. Since 26 April 2000 he has been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance pending determination of his disability allowance entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was examined by a medical assessor of my Department on 9 June 2000 with regard to his medical eligibility for receipt of disability allowance. Having regard to the opinion of the medical assessor he was considered not to be eligible for the allowance. Due to an oversight, however, a decision regarding his entitlement to disability allowance was not communicated to him until 23 <Col N="1281" /> October 2000. A further application for disability allowance was received on 19 October 2000 by my Department. Based on the information supplied in this application and following further consideration by the Department's medical assessor the person concerned has been awarded disability allowance from the date of his original application and any arrears due will be issued to him shortly.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance, introduced in 1993, is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour work-force, either through employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date more than 72,000 people have participated. Currently there are more than 39,000 participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self employment options.</P>

As part of this completion process, relevant proposals have been put forward by the social partners. These include a proposal from the community and voluntary pillar that child care costs should be addressed by means of a parental child care payment, which would be paid in respect of all families with a child under the age of 14, regardless of whether the parent or parents were in paid employment. The payment would depend on the age of the child, with higher payments for children under five. A similar proposal has also been made to me in a number of pre-budget submissions, including those from the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Childcare 2000 campaign.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997 with the overall target of reducing the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9%-15% of the population to less than 5%-10% by 2007. In 1999, as part of this Government's social inclusion strategy, I announced a revised target to reduce the numbers in consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004. At that time, consideration was also given to moving into a new phase of the national <Col N="1283" /> anti-poverty strategy, encompassing a broader social inclusion strategy which would rebase the original targets and begin to consider new areas where a strategic response could be used to alleviate exclusion.</P>
      <P>These considerations informed the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, under which we committed ourselves to revising and renewing the national anti-poverty strategy. The methodology underlying the strategy will be reviewed, existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate and new targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, and housing-accommodation. As a first step towards updating the strategy, a meeting was held with the social partners in July to agree the review process.</P>
      <P>Following on from that meeting, a number of working groups, with social partner representation, are currently being established to facilitate the review of targets. The first meetings of the working groups on housing-accommodation and health were held in October and working groups on employment, education, rural poverty and urban disadvantage are also being established. A separate working group will be established, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In line with other commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in relation to the strategy, the national anti-poverty strategy analysis will be expanded to include emerging causes of poverty such as racism and mechanisms for strengthening the involvement of the social partners will be considered.</P>
      <P>The results of our activity over the past three and a half years are conclusive. Consistent poverty has been reduced to 6%-8%, and we are well on our way to achieving the national anti-poverty strategy target of less than 5% by 2004. Unemployment is now 3.8%, with long-term unemployment standing at just 1.6%. We have invested millions of pounds in supports and initiatives that aim to help break the cycle of disadvantage. I am confident that the national anti-poverty strategy review will provide the basis for further progress towards our goal of effectively eradicating poverty.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, JI, is a three-year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The programme is available to persons 35 years of age or older who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults or one parent family payment. The fundamental objective of JI is to progress participants into mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>A consultancy review of JI undertaken in 1999 made a number of recommendations regarding the future operation of the programme, one of which was to extend direct entitlement to secondary benefits, which includes the Christmas bonus payments, to JI workers. This recommendation was implemented with effect from April 2000. The Deputy should note, however, that only workers entitled to secondary benefits prior to commencing the JI programme will be eligible for these benefits and the general restrictions with regard to total household income will continue to apply.</P>
      <P>JI workers in receipt of revenue job assist in 1999, which also carries an entitlement to secondary benefits, would also have had an entitlement to a Christmas bonus payment for that year. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has indicated that it will examine any particular case the Deputy may have in mind and arrange for any arrears to be paid.</P>
      <P>As advised by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, persons in receipt of unemployment benefit are not entitled to the full secondary benefit package, and consequently are not eligible to claim rent and mortgage interest supplement, the national fuel scheme and the Christmas bonus. However, with effect from April this year unemployed persons may opt for the unemployment payment most beneficial to them, that is, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, which may include secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>The conditions attaching to the payment and retention of secondary benefits is a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and I have no function in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the current situation in Uganda, across a whole range of sectors. Our information on the country was updated in preparation for and during the recent visit by the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware too of the issues raised by GOAL in relation to HIV-AIDS and the ebola virus. I answered questions on these issues last week. In those replies I said that I was keenly conscious that the disease of HIV-AIDS is causing extreme suffering and hardship for many individuals and their dependants in Uganda. Out of an overall population of 21.2 million, approximately 1.9 million Ugandans are infected with HIV accord<Col N="1286" /> ing to the Uganda poverty status report 2000. AIDS has been reported as one of the leading causes of death in adults and there were an estimated 1.7 million AIDS orphans in Uganda by the end of last year. Life expectancy in Uganda has fallen from 48 to 42 in the last decade and the HIV-AIDS epidemic has been the major factor in this regard.</P>
    <P>The extent of this problem and the impact it is having on development in Uganda and throughout sub-Saharan Africa requires a substantive and coherent response from the international community and from governments of affected countries. Though now late in the epidemic, there is at this point a much greater global recognition of the extent of the disease and, as a result, a substantive volume of international resources has been mobilised for HIV-AIDS prevention and containment.</P>
    <P>The Government of Uganda responded early and comprehensively to the problem of HIV-AIDS in Uganda and the President has never wasted an opportunity to highlight the extent of the problem of HIV-AIDS and the need for a systematic and sustained response. Since the early 1990's, the Government has instituted a multi-sectoral response to HIV-AIDS that has resulted in a very significant decrease in the annual incidence of the disease. Recent data would indicate that the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in Uganda has decreased from over 14% of adults in the early 1990's to approximately 9% in 1999.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition also in Uganda that HIV-AIDS will continue to present a huge challenge to poverty reduction and development for many years ahead and that attempts to control the disease will need to be sustained. Furthermore, the response of the Government of Uganda to HIV-AIDS is now being highlighted by the international community as an example to be followed by other poorer countries being faced with a similar burden of HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>A specific HIV-AIDS strategy was launched by the Minister of State Deputy O'Donnell, in January 2000, in response to the huge threat HIV-AIDS presents to the development of countries which benefit from the support of the Irish Government's bilateral aid programme, known as Ireland Aid. This strategy provides for the allocation of a very considerable volume of resources for HIV-AIDS activities across the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    <P>Uganda is one of Ireland Aid's six priority countries. Ireland Aid has allocated substantive financial resources in support of HIV-AIDS interventions in Uganda over the next three years, in line with its overall HIV-AIDS strategy and in response to the huge challenge of HIV-AIDS in the country. In addition, very substantial resources have been allocated for the development of the health sector. Clearly financial resources will be directed to interventions that are demonstrated to be effective and that are situated within the framework of the Government of Uganda's national strategic framework for HIV-<Col N="1287" /> AIDS activities. This framework has been agreed between Government, international agencies and civil society organisations.</P>
    <P>In addition to support for HIV-AIDS interventions undertaken by the Government and civil society in Uganda, Ireland Aid has a budget this year of £7.37 million available to Irish aid organisations, under its co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations, for development projects which meet basic needs such as primary health care. Following the Taoiseach's recent announcement at the UN Millennium Summit in New York of the Government's commitment to reach the UN development target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007, it is anticipated that funding available to Irish aid organisations under the co-financing scheme will increase from next year.</P>
    <P>In those earlier replies, I referred also to the outbreak of the virulent viral disease ebola in the Gulu district of northern Uganda which presents a further challenge in the fight against communicable diseases. A total of 111 cases have been reported with 41 deaths. Cases were first reported in the local hospital but have since occurred in the surrounding community. The ebola virus is highly contagious and strict containment is the only viable response in the absence of a specific treatment or vaccine. A rapid response team was dispatched by the World Health Organisation to support its local office in Uganda and to work with the Ugandan national authorities in containing the disease within the outbreak zone. Following a recent request from the Ugandan authorities, the Government has granted IR£75,000 in support of the work of the World Health Organisation in Gulu.</P>
    <P>The Irish aid programme in Uganda is therefore using all of the means available to it, through focused Government programmes and through NGOs, to assist in the battle against HIV-AIDS and the ebola virus and to assist in the many challenges right across the health sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, I met with representatives from the Retired Aviation Staff Association on 10 October 2000 to hear details of their submission presented to the task force on pensions. The secretary general and other officials from my <Col N="1288" /> Department also met the association on 23 October 2000.</P>
    <P>Enhancements to the existing entitlements of pensioners must be linked to and in line with any improvements that emerge from negotiations between staff interests and the companies concerned on proposed new pension schemes. My Department will monitor these negotiations with particular regard to the concerns of retired staff.</P>
    <P>While fully aware of the commercial imperatives under which the companies operate and the cost implications of pension enhancements, I nevertheless hope the agreed terms of any new schemes will enable the pensioner's concerns to be addressed as much as possible.</P>

      <P>The Dublin suburban rail strategic review completed earlier this year by Ove Arup and Partners, on behalf of CIE, recommended that a rail link between Dublin and Navan be introduced on a phased basis, subject to a suitable land use development strategy for the corridor. The cost is estimated at £91 million. Further assessment will, however, be required to determine a firmer cost estimate.</P>
      <P>The recent report published by the Dublin Transportation Office entitled A Platform for Change, recommends that a new rail line be constructed off the Maynooth line near Clonsilla <i>via</i> Dunboyne to Navan. The report envisages the rail link being completed in two phases, the first being the construction of a spur from Clonsilla to Dunboyne, to be completed by 2006, and the extension of the line to Navan to be completed by 2010.</P>
      <P>Under the DTO strategy, the planning and design of the line to railway order stage will take place in the period up to 2003.</P>

      <P>It is only possible therefore to give a representative view of the total amount of tax arising as selling prices may vary considerably from vendor to vendor.

    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> There is no excise on natural gas, coal or electricity. VAT is at 12.5% and the price of these products are not surveyed by the Revenue Commissioners. While consumers will bear the full taxable cost, i.e. VAT and excise, taxable persons are able to reclaim the VAT as part of their business inputs with the exception of petrol. Goods or services which are part of their personal expenditure would however be subject to the full rate of VAT and excise. Red diesel is only legal for use in the United Kingdom and the equivalent used by agriculture etc. in this State is green. I do not have a national figure for the price of a litre of green diesel, however, the excise per litre is 0.03 pence and the VAT rate is 21%.</P>
    <P>Electricity, natural gas and coal are subject to VAT at 12.5% while automotive fuels are subject to VAT at 21%.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 478 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act, formerly section 5 of the 1996 Finance Act, introduced a tax relief in respect of the purchase and-or installation of house alarm systems for persons aged 65 years of age and over and living alone. The legislation provided specifically that the tax relief would be available only for the period 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998.</P>
      <P>The tax relief was allowed to lapse in part because of the small numbers of claims being submitted and I have no plans to reintroduce it.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that sufficient data is not available to estimate the possible yield of such a 1% levy on the turnover of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>It is tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that a 1% levy on the taxable profits, before capital allowances of all financial institutions could yield of the order of £50 million if the levy were applied to all deposit-taking institutions, insurance companies and all IFSC institutions. This estimate of yield excludes the effect of any levy imposed on the funds of life assurance companies or collective investment undertakings as these are in effect the funds of policy holders and unit holders and not of the institutions. If the 1% levy were applied only to deposit-taking institutions, the yield would be of the order of £10 million.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out, however, that in the case of the IFSC financial institutions the imposition of such a levy would be in conflict with the assurances about tax on profits given by successive Irish Governments to these institutions when they were setting up here. Also, in the case of domestic financial institutions, such a levy on their profits could be in conflict with the single general rate of corporation tax on trading profits which accords with EU State aid rules and which it was agreed should be put in place by this and the preceding Government.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give comparative figures between the rates of PRSI and levels as applied here and the equivalent charges in the United Kingdom; and if he will give indicative examples of the affect of these on take home pay when taken together with income tax and health levies in both jurisdictions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In both Ireland and the United Kingdom, social insurance is calculated on a weekly basis and is payable by both employers and employees. While Ireland's system is known as PRSI, that is, pay-related social insurance, the system in the UK is known as national insurance contributions, i.e. NIC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, in the current tax year, full-rate PRSI contributors pay 4.5% of their income in PRSI. However, the first £100 of weekly earnings is exempt from liability to PRSI and there is also a ceiling above which no PRSI is payable which is currently £26,500. The UK operates a similar system for employees. The current rate of NIC applicable is 10% with a weekly exemption for earnings up to £76. There is also a ceiling of £535 per week or £27,820 per annum, above which no NIC is payable. Thus far both systems are comparable in the fact that they both have weekly exemptions and ceilings. However, in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, an additional feature was introduced into the Irish PRSI system to benefit low earning full-rate employees. Under this system, an employee who earns less than £11,750 per annum is exempt from liability to PRSI but if his/her income exceeds this limit then he-she is <Col N="1296" /> liable to PRSI under the normal system, as described above.</P>
    <P>Employers in Ireland pay PRSI in respect of their employees at a rate of 8.5% where the employee's income is below the threshold of £280 per week or £14,560 annually. Otherwise if the employee's income exceeds the threshold of £14,560 per annum, a rate of 12% is payable on all of the employee's income up to a ceiling of £36,600. Employers in the UK pay NIC in respect of their employees at a rate of 12.2%. However, there is no ceiling above which no NIC is applicable but there is a weekly exemption for the employer's contribution of £84 per week.</P>
    <P>The UK does not have a health contribution levy on income as Ireland does.</P>
    <P>The following examples show for various taxpayers on various incomes, calculations of net income and average tax rates for both Ireland and the UK respectively. The figures for Ireland take account of income tax, the health contribution and employee PRSI, while figures for the UK take account of income tax and employee NIC.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, the Irish tax system is more favourable for taxpayers on low incomes and for one-income married couples. The income level under which it is more beneficial for a single person to be assessed under Ireland's regime is £20,000. The similar figure for a married couple with two incomes is £40,000. The level under which it is more beneficial to be assessed under the Irish system for married one-income couples with children, is £56,000.</P>

      <Col N="1297" /> It is appreciated that the tables are making a comparison between salaries in Irish currency and salaries in sterling, e.g. IR£10,000 with £10,000 stg., making no adjustment for exchange rates. When the data are converted to take account of the exchange rate difference, the gap in average tax rates narrows, in some cases substantially, but the pattern is essentially the same.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries concerning this case following previous representations by the Deputy. I have been advised that the South Eastern Health Board is at present looking at the position of all temporary public health nurses employed within the board's area in the light of my Department's circular 85/2000 concerning revised arrangements for the sponsorship of student public health nurses. A meeting has been arranged with a representative of the INO and this will take place shortly. It is hoped that following this meeting, and further discussions with the directors of public health nursing in the board's area, that the position of the nurse concerned will be clarified.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board recognises the contribution made by temporary public health nurses in the past and is endeavouring to have the situation resolved as soon as possible.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the general medical scheme, participating doctors are required, as per the contract, to be routinely available for consultation for a total of 40 hours per week on five days or more by agreement with the health board. Within this framework, contracted doctors enjoy significant flexibility in determining their precise scheduled surgery hours.</P>
      <P>The contracted doctor is also required to make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with him or her or a locum-deputy outside normal hours for urgent cases. Traditionally, this has been realised through rota, deputy or bureau arrangements between doctors which are usually organised by the individual contracted general practitioners themselves on a mutually agreed local basis.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the development of the out of hours general practitioner co-operative can be viewed as a voluntary and highly effective rota system structured, and supported by public funding, to maximise appropriate out of hours service provision to patients in a way that also allows participating doctors to best plan their involvement. In that regard, it gives rise to no particular issues that would necessitate separate contractual arrangements and, accordingly, I would be very surprised if any doctors, individually or collectively, were to seek to represent the out of hours co-operative concept as having contractual implications justifying special arrangements.</P>
      <P>Currently, the general practice out of hours co-operatives are being piloted in the SEHB, CAREDOC, and NEHB, North East Doc, areas. I am aware that other health boards are interested in developing these models in their regions and it is my intention that, on the basis of experience gained from the pilot projects, my Department will progress the expansion of the co-operative models to other boards in 2001. Indeed, some preparatory work is already under way within some boards in that regard.</P>
      <P>I should conclude by stating that it is already clear from the pilots that while all projects will understandably have some regard to local factors in their development, the expansion of these schemes must also be subject to ensuring that they comply with certain general principles of good practice, for example, the use of contracted doctors rather than locums, if they are to justify the public funding involved in their operation.</P>

      <P>The Pre-hospital Emergency Care Council which I recently established, will provide a firm basis for the future development of professional standards in the ambulance service and pre-hospital care generally. One of the first tasks the council will be asked to address are the issues surrounding the development of advanced emergency medical technician training, including the regulatory issues which arise in relation to this. I expect the council to deal comprehensively with all issues in its consideration of advanced training and to provide a detailed implementation plan in the near future.</P>

      <P>As part of the settlement of the nurses' pay dispute, the Labour Court recommended payment of a lump sum of £1,250 to all nurses employed in the public sector. The lump sum was also payable to student public health nurses, post-registration student nurses and pupil midwives. It was not payable to student nurses participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes or to <Col N="1300" /> agency nurses. The qualifying date for payment of the lump sum was 5 November 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, earlier this year the Nursing Alliance raised queries with the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, regarding temporary-part-time nurses who may not have worked on that date. In February 2000 the HSEA advised the Nursing Alliance that employers would consider applications from nurses in this category who had worked a minimum of eight hours per week in the 13 weeks preceding 5 November 1999 or a total of 104 hours in the same period. In calculating the total hours worked the reckonable period should be adjusted to take account of the nine day work stoppage.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a joint management-Nursing Alliance working group has dealt with a number of individual cases raised by the Nursing Alliance concerning payment of the £1,250 lump sum, having regard to the criteria outlined above.</P>
      <P>The position is that the individual in question does not qualify for payment of the lump sum under the agreed criteria.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Mid-Western Health Board that arrangements are in place to deal with the industrial relations issues raised by the group concerned.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has experienced some difficulty in relation to availability of qualified psychiatric nurses. The board currently has 50 student nurses in training in the mental health nursing school and intends to recruit an additional 30 students next year. It should be noted that this school was re-opened just over 12 months ago following a number of years when no psychiatric nurses were trained in the mid west region. The re-opening of the school will make a major contribution towards the supply of psychiatric nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board acknowledges that the physical environment of some of the wards at St. Joseph's Hospital is not satisfactory. It is actively pursuing a programme of transferring a significant number of patients to more appropriate community based settings. Facilities have been completed-pur<Col N="1302" /> chased in order to significantly reduce the present patient population in the hospital.</P>
    <P>In association with the intellectual disability services in the region, community-based facilities have been developed for 36 persons with intellectual disability. A nursing home has been purchased and is in the process of being commissioned. This will allow for the transfer of approximately 40 older psychiatric patients from the hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the case is as follows. The woman concerned tested positive for hepatitis C <Col N="1304" /> in October 1997, while she and her family were resident in the State. Subsequently, she attended the liver unit at St James's Hospital in Dublin, and claimed travelling and subsistence expenses from the <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme operated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, now the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. The <i>ex-gratia </i>scheme was introduced in 1994 to ensure that persons who had contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products made available by the BTSB did not undergo any undue hardship in availing of medical treatment for their condition. The <i>ex-gratia </i>payments are made on an interim basis, pending the award of compensation by the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal or by the courts.</P>
      <P>The BTSB made <i>ex-gratia</i> payments totalling £2,061 to the woman concerned, between November 1997 and April 1998. <i>Ex-gratia</i> payments are usually made on production of receipts. However, following representations from the support group Positive Action to the Department in December 1997, arrangements were made to pay the woman in advance. The BTSB ceased making <i>ex-gratia </i>payments to the woman in April 1998. In order to continue making payments the board required medical evidence that anti-D had in fact been administered to her. It wrote to the woman on 5 June, 15 June and 7 July 1998 requesting this confirmation. No such confirmation has been provided to the BTSB to date.</P>
      <P>A serious dispute has emerged in this case between the woman and the Western Health Board regarding the source of her hepatitis C infection. The woman herself believes that the source was infected anti-D and is of the strong view that anti-D was administered to her following the birth of her child in Castlebar hospital in March 1993. She alleges that a medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered. The board stated that its medical records show that anti-D was not administered to the woman while she was under its care in March 1993.</P>
      <P>The BTSB has had a sequencing test carried out on a blood sample from the woman concerned. Tests carried out by the independent laboratory jointly run by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Edinburgh indicated that the source of the woman's hepatitis C infection was not the anti-D product manufactured by the BTSB.  The laboratory's findings are disputed by the woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woman's family requested the Garda to investigate whether anti-D was administered to the woman in Castlebar hospital, and whether her hospital records had been materially altered. The Garda visited the hospital on 28 October and the 16 November 1998 in relation to this investigation, and, at the request of the hospital, took a number of records away for forensic examination. I have been informed by the Western Health Board that the Garda authorities have had no <Col N="1305" /> further contact with them in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the woman's medical treatment, I have been informed that she attended the liver unit at St James's Hospital for medical treatment upon first being diagnosed with hepatitis C. In June 1998, her husband wrote to my Department stating that his wife had returned to the United States, and was seeking recoupment of the costs of her medical treatment there. Her medical treatment was not stopped while she was resident in the State, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen indicated on numerous occasions to the woman concerned and her family, that he considered that the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal was the most appropriate forum in which to have this matter resolved. The tribunal was established by the Oireachtas and has a statutory remit to determine causation on the balance of probabilities. In addition, the tribunal has the confidence of all four of the support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of infected blood and blood products. Indeed, approximately 1,400 individuals have had their claims determined by the tribunal to date.  On 30 June 1998 an offer was made to the woman concerned to arrange an early hearing on the causation issue alone, independent of considerations of compensation. In addition, as the woman is now living abroad, my Department offered as an exceptional measure to arrange financial assistance for herself and her family to facilitate their attendance at the compensation tribunal. It was also explained to the woman that while the tribunal does not normally compensate persons in respect of health care requirements, claimants to the tribunal who were ordinarily <Col N="1306" /> resident outside the State may apply to the tribunal for health care costs.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the woman's legal representatives informed my Department that their client would be attending the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal, and the necessary arrangements were made by my Department to cover the expenses which she would incur in attending the tribunal. As the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal is independent in its operation of both myself and my Department, I am not in a position to confirm the outcome of the hearing. I understand from media reports, however, that the woman's case was withdrawn from the compensation tribunal before any determination had been made. I should point out that a decision of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal in relation to causation would in no way debar the woman from proceeding to the High Court at a later stage if she should choose to do so. Claimants are only required to discontinue legal proceedings if they choose to accept the compensation tribunal's award.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have examinations made again into the possibility of sanctioning the use in emergency situations of green flashing lights on cars being used by members of the medical profession in the context of the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996; his views on whether a review of these regulations would be timely in view of the fact that more people are resorting to general practitioners in emergency situations as a result of overcrowding and other problems at the accident and emergency units in our acute hospital services.</Quest>

      <P>I have no proposals to review the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations with a view to providing for the use of green flashing lights on cars being used in emergencies by members of the medical profession. The use of flashing lights must be limited to protect their <Col N="1318" /> effectiveness in emergencies and in order to avoid causing confusion among other road users.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains the commitment that, recognising the progress made in the negotiations in relation to child care, and following a completion process with the social partners, the Government would adopt a strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs. As part of this completion process, relevant proposals have been put forward by the social partners. These include a proposal from the community and voluntary pillar that child care costs should be addressed by means of a parental child care payment, which would be paid in respect of all families with a child under the age of 14, regardless of whether the parent or parents were in paid <Col N="1321" /> employment. The payment would depend on the age of the child, with higher payments for children under five. A similar proposal has also been made to me in a number of pre-budget submissions, including those from the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Childcare 2000 campaign.</P>
      <P>All of the options put forward by the social partners in this regard are being studied by the Government in the run up to the budget.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged 16 or over and under age 66. This disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical examination and a means test.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded disability allowance with effect from 19 March 1997. He was assessed with means of £53 per week derived from farming. On this basis he is entitled to a weekly disability allowance rate of payment of £25.50 per week. He also receives a fuel allowance of £5 per week which brings his total payment to £30.50.</P>
      <P>As the last means assessment for the person concerned was over three years ago my Department is arranging for a further review by the local social welfare inspector. The person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>

      <P>Irish social welfare legislation does not distinguish between nationals and non-nationals. Essentially any person from abroad who complies with the relevant immigration laws covering entry, living and working here is entitled to seek social welfare payments in compliance with the normal conditions. Depending on their country of origin, non-nationals will face differing immigration regimes and whether any restrictions apply e.g. right to work. Immigration policy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Claims for social welfare payments are determined in accordance with the same statutory conditions as claims by Irish nationals and, accordingly, the nationality of social welfare claimants is not generally recorded.</P>
      <P>EU citizens and other persons who are not Irish nationals but have the right to work here, may become entitled to claim an unemployment payment as entitlement is based on a person's insurance/employment record in the case of unemployment benefit and on means, residency and the right to work in the case of unemployment assistance. Consequently the need to maintain comprehensive statistics in relation to the nationality of persons claiming unemployment payments does not arise.</P>
      <P>In addition to national legislation, the entitlement of non-nationals to social welfare payments are governed by EU social security regulations and bilateral agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU social security regulations are a complex set of regulations covering migrant workers who are nationals of the member states of the European economic area, stateless persons and refugees and members of their families. The regulations provide for equality of treatment between workers who are nationals and other EEA nationals in relation to Irish social insurance and social assistance payments covered by the regulations. The regulations provide, among other things, for the aggregation, where necessary, of a worker's insurance record in all member states for the purpose of acquiring or retaining the right to benefit. Thus, workers who do not satisfy the contribution conditions in our national legislation can rely on aggregation to qualify for such payments as Irish disability benefit and unemploy<Col N="1323" /> ment benefit. If such persons have been insured in Ireland for at least one year, they can qualify for pro-rata pensions &ndash; i.e. invalidity pension, widow's and widower's pension, retirement and old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also concluded bilateral social security agreements with a number of countries which are designed to protect social security &ndash; pension &ndash; rights and prevent the possible double liability for payment of social security contributions. The agreements, cover workers and, in the main, long-term social security payments such as invalidity pension, old age contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The income maintenance needs of non-nationals whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and who do not qualify for any other payment are met for the most part by the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. SWA is administered by health boards on behalf of my Department and provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Where a person in full board accommodation receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure under the SWA scheme was some £219.3 million in 1999. Taking into account cash balances held by the health boards the net expenditure figure was £210.6 million. Of this total, rent supplements accounted for £100.6 million and mortgage interest payments accounted for £6.5 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that expenditure under the SWA scheme in 2000 will be approximately £258.2 million. Expenditure on rent supplements is expected to be in the region of £118.4 million and expenditure on mortgage supplements is expected to be in the region of £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>The expenditure on mortgage supplements is falling by 35% from approximately £6.5 million in 1999 to an anticipated £4.8 million in 2000, mainly because more people have found employment. In contrast, the estimated expenditure on rent supplements in 2000 has risen by 17%. This is due almost totally to the increased cost of rented accommodation as the number of recipients increased by only 2% in the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>The special measure which I introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, is designed to give further recognition to contributions paid prior to 1953. The Act, provided for the introduction, from May 2000, of a special flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50% of the standard maximum rate, i.e. £48 per week from May. To qualify, a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as inviting new applications for this special pension, the Department also undertook to review the position of some 13,500 people currently in receipt of a pro-rata pension to establish if the pre-53 pension would be more beneficial to them. Up to the end of October 2000, 9,165 of <Col N="1325" /> these cases had been reviewed with 6,191 receiving an improved payment. The balance of these cases will be reviewed as quickly as possible and all payments are backdated to May 2000 when the new provisions came into operation.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension are already very flexible and make it relatively easy for a widow/er to qualify for a payment. Persons with insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for the contributory scheme may be eligible for a widow(er)'s non-contributory pension or the one-parent family payment if they have dependent children.</P>
    <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where the person is over 66 years of age. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse. Widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>In budget 2000 the free schemes were extended to all persons aged over 75 years of age regardless of income and household composition. I have also made changes to the arrangements which are in place to provide support to widows and widowers in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. These include an enhanced bereavement grant, the introduction of the widowed parent grant for those with dependent children and improvements to the six weeks after death payment which is made when the deceased was a social welfare recipient.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my budget 2000 speech and following the review of the Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to extending a pension rate of £100 per week to all social welfare pensions for older people. In this regard, the weekly rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension was increased to £89.10 in May 2000 for those aged over 66. The maximum rate of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension for those aged over 66 was increased to £85.50 in May of this year.</P>
    <P>The question of making further improvements in the supports available for widows and widowers will be considered in the forthcoming budget.</P>

    <P>A patrol car attached to Rathcoole station is operated on a 24-hour basis. Where necessary, patrol cars from other stations within the district &ndash; Clondalkin, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot &ndash; respond to calls for assistance if the Rathcoole patrol car is otherwise engaged. All of these mobile patrols are directly under the control of the Garda communications centre at Harcourt <Col N="1331" /> Square which ensures that all emergency calls are responded to expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Outside of the present opening hours, gardaí are available to patrol the sub-district. These patrols are performed in the official patrol car and by foot patrols to ensure a visible presence in the Rathcoole area.</P>

      <Quest>the plans there are to extend the Public Order Act, 1994, in view of the wide spread concern with regard to unruly behaviour, the drinking of alcohol and the taking of other substances in public places, derelict sites and in unused buildings in view of the fact these problems are a source of concern in many towns and communities here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which deals with public order offences, represented a radical overhaul of criminal justice legislation in the area of public order. It provides for a range of public order offences which can be committed in public places, such as intoxication, disorderly conduct, threatening or abusive behaviour, riot, affray etc. It also provides the gardaí with important powers to deal with public order offenders.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, makes it an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity. Section 5 of the 1994 Act creates the offence of disorderly conduct in a public place and section 6 creates the offence of using or engaging in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Section 4 of the 1994 Act also empowers the Garda to confiscate alcohol where it is suspected that an offence under that section is being committed or where it is suspected that an offence under sections 5 or 6 is being committed and the alcohol is relevant to those offences.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the 1994 Act empowers the Garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of a number of sections including sections 4, 5 or 6 or who are loitering in a public place in circumstances which give rise to apprehension for the safety of persons or property or the maintenance of the public peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the provisions of the 1994 Act are used extensively by the Garda and that it is widely accepted that the legislation has proved invaluable to the Garda in dealing with public order offences. I am therefore satisfied that the <Col N="1333" /> 1994 Act is providing an effective legal framework for dealing with behaviour which threatens public order. However, like all legislation, the 1994 Act is kept under review. In this respect, the Deputy may be aware from the press release on the Government's legislation programme, issued by the office of the Government Chief Whip on 27 September 2000, that a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill forms part of that programme. This Bill, the heads of which are currently being prepared within my Department, will provide for miscellaneous criminal law reform matters. I am in consultation with the Garda authorities in relation to provisions to be included in the Bill, and any proposals from the Garda to include provisions to amend the 1994 Act will be carefully considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Safety on school buses is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. The age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
      <P>In relation to safety in general I should mention that Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test.</P>
      <P>Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence. Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Contractor's vehicles are subject to inspection-testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and to improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability. On 14 September 2000 I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. The group will advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this group is in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The group will consider,<i> inter alia</i>, advising on the development of targeted interventions. It is anticipated that the focus of any recommended interventions will centre on increasing representation of the three target groups, including students from disadvantaged backgrounds, at third level-PLC level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support <Col N="1337" /> in promoting equity in access, and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged maintenance grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>The first instalment will be made to eligible students early in 2001 when the additional funds become available. This was made clear when I announced the increase. I have indicated that I would expect that up to 10,000 students will benefit from this measure. This is, of course, a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference specifically require that it advise me, <i>inter alia</i>, on the identification and tracking of the target groups.</P>
    <P>The action group will advise on the operational details of the measure and, in the meantime, it is not necessary for grantholders to apply for the special rate of maintenance grant. Once details have been finalised, arrangements will be made by my Department to ensure that all qualifying grantholders are placed on the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>With regard to accommodation costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>
    <P>These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage, rather than an across the board increase in grant levels which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have previously welcomed the report, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding provisions for second level schools.</P>
      <P>At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. The Deputy will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I recently announced the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year. My approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to per capita grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
      <P>Arising from the programme for economic and social progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £40 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives school authorities discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be obtained by the school.</P>
      <P>I have extended this scheme to all schools with effect from September of this year. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400, which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that, with effect from September 2000, all primary schools are in receipt of an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that I have increased the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, to approximately £12.2 million, and I will further increase the funding in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the school referred to by the Deputy is that it qualifies for grant assistance under the PESP scheme outlined above, and it has received the maximum grant available, £20,000, for secretarial and caretaking services for the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the person in question does not satisfy the relevant condition relating to means and, accordingly, has been deemed ineligible for a higher education grant by the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges. There is a residency requirement in the criteria relating to the free fees initiative to the effect that tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third-level course. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals.</P>
      <P>The person in question was deemed ineligible for free fees by the third level institution concerned, on the basis that she did not fulfil the residency requirement.</P>
      <P>The person concerned then requested that this decision be reviewed by my Department.</P>
      <P>Having taken the information provided by the person in question into consideration, it appears that, at most, she could be considered to have been resident in an EU member state for just two years and ten months in the five years preceding entry to third level. Short periods spent in Ireland while on annual leave cannot be reckonable for the purpose of meeting the minimum residency requirement.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, she is ineligible to benefit under the free fees initiative and will therefore be liable for tuition fees in respect of her undergraduate studies.</P>
      <P>I informed the person involved of this outcome by letter dated 12 October 2000.</P>
      <P>The conditions and terms of the free fees initiative are of general application and, accordingly, it is not possible to make an exception in individual cases such as this.</P>

      <P>The terms of this grants scheme provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that candidates are ineligible for an award under the scheme if they have completed more than the first year of a degree level course.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a teacher with a secondary level qualification cannot be made a permanent teacher at primary level without completing the 18 month transition course from secondary teaching to primary teaching; the plans he has to make this course available in County Sligo in view of the teacher staffing difficulties, as at present many teachers are unable to attend this course as it is only available in County Dublin and County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the only courses run in the State which allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the bachelor of education degree and the 18-month post-graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The 18-month course is a full-time course run to enable third level graduates to train as primary teachers rather than a transition course designed for secondary teachers who wish to become primary teachers.  </P>
      <P>The course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers and was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year. I have recently approved the running of a further 18-month course to commence early in 2001. Eligible secondary teachers may apply for this course in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Sligo already has a teacher training col<Col N="1344" /> lege specialising in the training of teachers of home economics and there are no plans at present to establish a primary teacher training college there.</P>

      <Quest>if he will intervene with all parties involved on behalf of a person (details supplied) in County Sligo and immediately allow him into the school (details supplied) in view of the fact that he needs to attend a school which caters for children with special needs and not a school for mentally handicapped as suggested, as it would have a negative impact on his development; if his attention has been drawn to his circumstances in view of the medical information provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
