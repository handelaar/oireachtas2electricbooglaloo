    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, and 80 together. </P>
      <P>My keynote address to the annual conference of the Irish Management Institute on 7 April focused on the main challenges facing the Irish economy and society in the years ahead, principally, globalisation, EU enlargement and rapid technological change. In particular, I emphasised the need to invest heavily so as to position Ireland to become a world class leader in the global, knowledge-based, digital economy; to build on that through the pursuit of top class policies on connectivity, education, regulation and partnership; and to deliver, through social partnership, the potential inherent in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That will require all sides to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the programme.</P>
      <P>Through the provisions set out in the Government's programme, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan, we are well positioned to ensure the long-term sustainability of economic and social progress. I made the point in my address, however, that the enormous potential of these highly ambitious programmes can be realised fully only if we maintain the level of discipline which has served us so well in the past.</P>
      <P>My address to the Institute of Directors on 20 April was focused on similar themes though, naturally, I gave particular prominence as well to the strong economic relationship between Ireland and Britain. Copies of both my speeches are available in the Oireachtas Library for further reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first plenary meeting under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on 26 April, the primary focus was on agreeing the detailed arrangements to secure full implemen<Col N="203" /> tation of the new programme. In that context, it was agreed to convene in the immediate future the Housing Forum and the Public Transport Forum, together with addressing a number of other priority issues affecting quality of life and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Consideration was also given to the current inflationary pressures in the economy and the meeting was satisfied there are solid grounds for expecting inflation to have fallen significantly by the end of the year. However, the vigorous implementation of all the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will be necessary to maintain a low inflationary environment. In addition, it was agreed that the Government and the social partners will monitor developments and discuss the options which are available to secure the low inflationary conditions provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>On the issue of widening representation in the social partnership process, I indicated in the House last month that the spirit within which the four pillars have operated over recent years suggests the desirability that any organisation wishing to become part of the process should secure the agreement of the appropriate social partner pillar. In the event of a positive response, the Government would consider such applications sympathetically, taking due account of such factors as continuance of a fair balance in representation as between the four pillars.</P>
    <P>Regarding the inclusion of the organisations specified in the questions, it is my understanding that none of them have yet sought formal agreement for inclusion under the appropriate pillar. With regard to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, obviously only those organisations involved in its negotiation will be involved in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any regrets about the fact that he described people who are concerned about the risk of inflation to the Irish economy and the possibility that the Irish economy is overheating as &ldquo;creeping Jesus&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not the people I was talking about when I used that term. I was talking about people who continually talk down and knock the economy. On the issue of inflation, as the Minister for Finance has said in the House many times, up until mid year it is expected that inflation will edge upwards. Today's figures show that that continues to be the trend and it is higher than anyone would like as we move to the second half of the year. It is projected that eased pressure on oil prices and other issues in the economy will lead to a reduction to an average of 3%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are the people the Taoiseach has in mind who are knocking the economy? The Taoiseach referred to the options he wants to discuss with the social partners to secure <Col N="204" /> low inflationary conditions in the economy. What are those options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton will recall I said that people, particularly in the financial sector in London, who have predicted for five years in a row that Ireland will go back into a recessionary position have been proved incorrect. I also referred to these people in my speech to the Institute of Directors when I was in London. One financial house in particular has made such predictions from the start. This House disputed the term Celtic tiger, which was introduced by an American magazine when I was Minister for Finance. It continued to make such references and it is a source of annoyance not only to me, but also to many Irish economists. These are the people about whom I was speaking in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was not referring to any domestic commentators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I made that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are exonerated. I wanted to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was referring only to English creeping Jesuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That might not be correct. People other than English people work in the financial sector in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Caught again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be Irish people, some of whom work in those houses too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>So, it is Irish people working in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing English offices which continually give negative accounts of the Irish economy. My point was that they might be proved right some day, but they, particularly one house to which I referred, have been consistently wrong to date.</P>
      <P>Regarding inflationary pressures, price stability has always been and will continue to be a key element. The Government has policies on housing and has introduced initiatives on land usage and the servicing of land. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is driving forward a number of issues to try to deal with the current difficulties and that must continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot control the position in relation to oil prices, but the recent OPEC deal should help in that regard. As was well predicted, the minimum wage is a factor in the April figures. My view is that that will not be a big problem in the future. However, there have been increases in many industries. I do not understand why that is <Col N="205" /> the case, but I am now carrying out the examination on it. Some industries and service sectors have increased amounts by 20% to cover what appears to be a 6% increase. Arms of the State will consider that situation and also the position in the licensed trade where there have been substantial increases for what do not appear to be good reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a comprehensive speech in Killarney and a number of questions understandably arise. On the first page of the print-out from the Internet of the Taoiseach's speech, he refers to four components of policy and states, among other things, that for the first time the Government has &ldquo;an immigration policy&rdquo;. On the second last page of the speech the Taoiseach states that the Government has a clear transport policy. If the Government has an immigration policy, where is it and how can we get access to it so we can understand it before we might criticise it? Has it been printed or published? I refer to an immigration policy as distinct from the refugee policy which is mentioned in the same clause.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the Government's clear transport policy. Is he referring to mark 3, mark 4 or mark 5 of the Luas policy for Dublin, or did we miss something? Where, if anywhere, is the clear transport policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Deputies are trying to address every area and every brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have cited only two. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but the Deputy could cite two more. On a number of occasions recently the Tánaiste made changes and spelt out our immigration policy. As the Deputy knows, we are talking about non-asylum seekers. The position is clear for Europeans and the mechanisms used to bring people from outside the EU into this country are working satisfactorily. I opened Xerox last week where 54% of a large workforce are not Irish. The system is working well. Filipinos have started working in the nursing area. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing there have been various changes. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They were clearly spelt out by the Tánaiste recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is it written in a coherent form or does that exist? We have had foreign workers coming into this country through foreign direct investment for the past 25 years. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at anything like the current level. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy has not changed. The same work permit system has been in place for the past 25 years. The Taoiseach told the IMI managers in Killarney that we have an immi<Col N="206" /> gration policy. Is that written somewhere in a coherent form? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen both speeches and statements by the Tánaiste where she clearly set it down. She will be glad to answer that question in the House.</P>
      <P>As regards transport, the Minister responsible and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are following a coherent strategy within the national development plan of putting in place the necessary resources to deal with an underfunded transport system. That covers the one item Deputy Quinn mentioned, light rail, and the National Roads Authority's extended plan. We will spend at least more than one and a half times the amount of money we have spent to date on the roads structure. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question in the interest of clarification as it might assist the Taoiseach in his reply. </P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to assist the Taoiseach. We lost five minutes as you, a Cheann Comhairle, were late coming into the Chamber. Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate to me or to anyone else who might read the speech where in Government Information Services we can access the clear transport policy to which he referred. </P>

That in itself is a cause of public insecurity. Will the Taoiseach accept the following advice from me: that he should not use such language to describe legitimate criticism of economic policy because it <Col N="208" /> shows insecurity on his part and on the part of the Minister for Finance?</P>

Furthermore, does he agree, given that the Government is discussing tax arrangements with the social partners which could discriminate against families where one spouse remains at home to care for children or a sick or elderly relative, that the inclusion in social partnership of the representative organisation of women in the home would make sense?</P>

Economic growth, which has doubled in little more than a decade, has created pressure, and it is for that reason that numerous measures have been passed by the House and a great deal of effort has been made to protect our environment. We must continue to do that. We must be vigilant about our environment in all its aspects, be it dealing with roads, waste, refuse or waste water management. All these issues must be carefully monitored and regulatory systems must be in place and funded to ensure we do not undermine our quality of life.</P>

      <P>I wish to turn to a separate but related matter to which the Taoiseach's speech in Killarney referred. He stated that Ireland will have to go some way towards bringing personal taxes in line with other developed, English-speaking countries which compete for skilled labour. Will the Taoiseach indicate to which countries he was referring? A guess would not go amiss.

My speech also highlighted other issues. Although we are considered to be more advanced than most countries in terms of share options and similar areas, advantages exist in other countries, such as the United States where many Irish workers are employed, especially in the software and technological industries, which should be examined. The Minister for Finance has already indicated he will do so. In relation to health, the practice has developed here over recent years that when people qualify &ndash; particularly nurses &ndash; they go to Australia for a year or two. A large number return home, but I do not consider there is anything we can do about people doing this when their courses finish. We must ensure that as many as possible remain and factors such as low taxes and affordable houses will attract them.</P>

I do not expect him to be familiar with this as it is in my constituency, but the project will be funded by the taxpayer in order to make way for a car park and a rather elegant facade on to Merrion Road.

We have all these aspiration wish lists, but each week 1,000 extra cars are being registered in Dublin and we now face the inevitable prospect of peak hour traffic being reduced to eight kilometres per hour, which is walking pace.

Otherwise, because GDP is counted, it will be the only thing to matter while quality of life will not be taken into account as it cannot be statistically measured. Does the Taoiseach further agree that the UN has done a great amount of work on the preparation of a quality of life index and that the statistical groundwork has been done for the introduction of such an index here? Does he agree that the most recent report by the UN body which carries out the quality of life indexation has been particularly bad as far as Ireland is concerned, criticising the deterioration in the comparative quality of life in Ireland principally because this is an even more unequal society than Britain, the most unequal society in terms of the distribution of resources in western Europe, and that this inequality contributes directly to a deterioration in the quality of life? For example, the poorer a man is the more likely he is to have a heart attack after the age of 50. These indices of quality of life, such as proneness to a heart condition caused by income inequality, are things we should measure and to which we should give as much thought as to GDP about which the current and previous Governments have been so willing to congratulate themselves.</P>

      <P>I am honoured to have represented for 23 years large areas where the quality of life used to be appalling, where people lived in tenements with one toilet to 24 flats and where there was no hot water. That was the situation in my area when I entered this House, while now we have some of the best and highest quality housing and some of the lowest pupil-teacher ratios in schools. Some of the best facilities in the country are for people on the margins. Therefore, I do not accept what Deputy Bruton says. Our health service is better than the health service in most countries, as are our library and other excellent facilities.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gormley is correct when he says we should monitor things and look at indices, but let us not try to say that everything has become worse as that is not the case.

Does he agree that the national anti-poverty strategy objectives do not include an element concerning health status and that, therefore, we do not measure health as an index of poverty? Does he agree that we should have a comprehensive quality of life index which takes due account of health status, which will show that an Irish person aged 65 years has the lowest life expectancy in the EU even though we are financially one of the better off countries? Life expectancy is related to quality of life, and the fact that 65 year olds in Ireland have the lowest life expectancy tells us there is something wrong with the Celtic tiger.</P>

During the discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the social partners agreed they would look not just at national economic indicators in gross domestic product or gross national product, but that they would look at all the other indices. I stated 15 minutes ago in reply to Deputy Gormley that I agreed with that. We can look at quality of life issues now because we do not have 18% unemployment, people are getting a decent education and we have reached a stage where people continue on to third level education and resources are available to address homelessness, problems among the Traveller community and the drugs issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton can accuse me of misplaced rhetoric. He and I seem to differ in regard to which country we live in, because as far as I am concerned, things have improved dramatically and rapidly and this has been sustained throughout the past ten or 20 years.</P>

      <P>&mdash;there is a fear that because the headline rate of inflation is almost three times the European average, at just under 5% as against 1.9% in the rest of the EU, much of the solidarity built into the PPF will begin to unravel, particularly for pensioners and people dependent on social welfare, and that even that measure of <Col N="213" /> increase, i.e. inflation on basic social welfare payments, is no longer adequate when one examines other increases in whatever way one wishes to measure them? Does he agree it would be desirable in order to consolidate the PPF, to which the Labour Party gives its full support, that rather than inviting the social partners to look at the measures to which Deputies Bruton and Gormley have referred, the Government might take the lead for a change and propose a quality of life index not based on the minimalist internationally available statistics to which the United Nations can refer, which is infant mortality and literacy along with <i>per capita</i> income, but some other agreed indices for which we have statistical evidence? Much of that data is available to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. We should collectively agree that there is a desirability in constructing such an index, which would have the support of the social partners and the political parties inside and outside this House, to measure in absolute and comparative terms whether all of us are moving together at the same speed. We are not moving together at the same speed, and while things have undoubtedly speeded up, does the Taoiseach agree that the gap between the vanguard and the rearguard has widened to an unacceptable level and that is the point about this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all central to what is happening. I assure the Deputy that the Government will drive that policy forward. Even in comparison with five years ago the NAPS programmes have reached their baseline targets, which I accept are not great. I do not say everybody is wonderfully well off because we know they are not. However, the NAPS programmes are trying to examine all the issues. I, along with some other Members, attended the launch of the Combat Poverty Agency report last week, which highlighted where it thinks we should go over the next three, five and seven years. I gave Government support in my speech to a number of initiatives in which the agency is involved but it would be useful to include those in the social partnership process because they do not just refer to pay and related issues which tend to take up all the discussion. It is good that the social partners will address these issues and that they agree that they are equally or perhaps more important.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Quinn knows, benchmarks are used for everything under the national anti-poverty strategy. Only in that way can it be seen from research whether successive budgets or estimate campaigns are delivering what they aim to achieve. Therefore, we can do the same. Last week, I had discussions about some of the international indices in this area. The first item on that list concerns child mortality rates, of which Ireland has one of the best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I will rephrase that. It refers to babies because it concerns infants under 15 months old. Ireland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world. One must take realistic indices, however, and it is no good just picking a number. We have to address matters such as social housing, homelessness and Travellers, which requires resources. That is what we are doing. Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, produced a report on homelessness and we have launched a report on the Traveller community also. We are trying to put resources into these areas, many of which have not attracted sufficient funding in the past. Deputy Bruton mentioned statistics concerning the adult population, but only 5% of the Traveller community live beyond 55 years of age. If we are talking about quality of life in the true sense, we must include such people as well as the people on drugs in my own constituency and in Deputy Quinn's. That is the issue and I do not particularly want to get into a semblance of figures from Burtonport to Schull. We know where the problems are and we should progressively put resources into those areas of need, of which there are about six major ones in the country. When we have done that perhaps we can examine other areas. Those are the real quality of life issues. </P>

The Taoiseach still seems to be using the terms &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; and &ldquo;standard of living&rdquo; as if they are interchangeable. Does he recognise that there is a fundamental difference between them? That is the problem. Is the Taoiseach aware that when indices of sustainable economic welfare were introduced in other countries they showed quite clearly that a threshold is always reached, beyond which economic growth actually leads to a deterioration in the quality of life? </P>

      <P>I have said how the Government intends to proceed and that is within the national anti-povery strategy and other programmes. In conjunction with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his colleagues, we want to see if we can develop such a scheme with the social partners. That is the commitment in the programme for Government and I am merely restating it. I am aware of the numerous models to which Deputy Gormley referred. Other countries rarely take much cognisance of their own figures in these areas. That is a fact. I do not want to sign up to a system that nobody takes seriously because that would be of no value to us. What I am saying is that in the work that is going on and in line with what the Combat Poverty Agency would want to do, we should benchmark our<Col N="216" /> selves against whatever criteria they come up with. That is a good idea but I will not predetermine those discussions.</P>

      <P>In terms of the widening gap between those at the bottom and those at the top, is the Taoiseach familiar with a conference held yesterday in my constituency where, for example, the county council advised that 1,210 cars were taken out of the stream of the Dodder in the Tallaght area between January and April? Will the Taoiseach agree that only a massive transfer of resources to tackle the multi-deprivation that is producing that kind of joyriding mayhem in certain parts of Dublin, where his constituency and mine are afflicted by the problem, will deal with it? Will the Taoiseach say if there are plans, either in the investment plan or otherwise in Government, to deal with that level of multi-deprivation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the multi-deprivation referred to by Deputy Rabbitte, we must put resources into education, training and lifelong learning, particularly for young people who drop out of the education system, and give them proper training for the jobs that are available. Those who are young should be given proper remedial education at a young age, whether on literacy, numeracy or whatever. That is happening in great parts of this city and other cities where the problems are enormous and we can see the benefits of that, but it requires resources which it is getting now. The Minister for Education, Deputy Woods, said recently, following on from the former Minister, Deputy Martin, in his period as Minister, that schemes like Breaking the Cycle, bringing down the PTR numbers and providing home liaison teachers is the way to deal with those problems. We have to progressively and continually do that and put in the resources. </P>
      <P>I note what the Deputy said about joyriding. Five times in the past ten years we gave additional powers to deal with this problem and we are now back in a cycle again. A legislative issue will not stop the problem but it is a&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Cabinet committee on infrastructure has met on six occasions to date. Its last meeting was on 18 April 2000 and the next meeting will take place later this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee on infrastructure is an integral part of Government and its meetings, as with any Cabinet committee, are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up over time of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if I understood the report of that reply. Perhaps I am not supposed to ask a question, but I will have a go anyway. In an interview recently carried in <i>The Irish Times</i>, a very flattering and favourable interview, the Taoiseach indicated at the outset that Irish industry, in particular the infrastructural construction industry, would have to get used to the idea of foreign contractors coming in to do infrastructural works which the industry locally was not capable of providing. I understand in the same context the Taoiseach made reference, or reference surrounded it, to the fact that only two domestic tenders were received for the completion of the C ring and the M50. Without breaching the manifest confidentiality of this secret committee of the Cabinet, what plans, if any, does the Taoiseach have to facilitate the arrival of largescale construction companies, which will ensure the £41 billion national development plan can be completed on time and within budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy gave a correct report of what I said. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as well as the CIF and others, have clearly indicated, given the size of some of the contracts, that some contractors may need to go into partnership with international companies. I have no problem with such partnerships, whether done through joint ventures or other arrangements. Given their enormity, the completion of some of these contracts will necessitate the employment of outside contractors, and contractors will be interested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In April I submitted a paper to the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development and public private partnerships outlining proposals for a new institutional framework for public transport. The following are the main elements of the proposals which impact on CIE. Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann should be established as separate independent companies and the existing geographical restrictions on their areas of operation should be removed. Iarnród Éireann should be divided into two independent companies, one responsible for the railway infrastructure and the other responsible for the operation of railway services. The CIE light rail project office should provide the basis for a separate function which would be responsible for the procurement of major infrastructural projects on a public private partnership basis, independent of the public transport operating companies. The CIE holding company should cease to have any operational role and should no longer own the bus and rail companies. We are considering whether its dissolution would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>My paper identified a number of significant issues requiring further consideration, including pensions and salaries. I will also be taking into account the position of employees under the Transport Act, 1986, which provides for the transfer back to CIE of subsidiary company employees where a subsidiary is wound up. I also suggested that there should be independent regulation of public transport, covering matters such as the regulation of the bus market, allocation of State financial support for public transport services through public service contracts and other market regulation responsibilities arising from public private partnerships and EU legislation. It will be the responsibility of this independent regulatory function to procure public transport services and to ensure more effective co-ordination and integration.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee to which the Taoiseach referred will this evening consider the second paper which I said a month ago I would put forward.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>The reforms will take a period of years to implement, requiring new legislation, a lengthy period of negotiations with CIE staff and the putting in place of new independent regulatory structures and the legal and administrative measures necessary to establish new independent bus and rail companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A public transport forum will shortly be established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It will have representatives from all the partnership pillars, including the trade unions. I will be asking the forum, as one of its priority tasks, to consider the proposals in the framework document. I also intend to seek <Col N="220" /> early Government approval for the publication of a policy paper which will address both institutional and regulatory reform, bringing together the contents of my recent institutional paper and a separate paper on regulation of the bus market in Dublin. This will set out more detailed information on implementation priorities and an indicative timetable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Government decide on these proposals? Will it be this session? This will take a long time to resolve from an industrial relations and legislative perspective. The Minister would be better employed in considering a proper Dublin transport authority to deal with the implementation of public transport initiatives and the establishment of a tendering competition for bus services to increase capacity as soon as possible. I have been informed that six different pieces of legislation will be involved. Will the rights of CIE employees under the Transport Act, 1986, be preserved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet made a decision on my paper, on which there was general agreement, three or four weeks ago. The paper I will put forward at 5.30 p.m. this evening is a more detailed amplification of that and I hope there will also be agreement on it. The Cabinet infrastructural sub-committee which comprises half the Cabinet members will then go to the full Cabinet for ratification. One of our first tasks will be the establishment of a shadow regulatory authority to presage the full regulatory authority. This will be done by the introduction of legislation next year. This year, we hope to grant some of the routes requested under the licensing arrangement. There has been a large number of applications. The existing Act allows the granting of licences to routes not served by Dublin Bus. That is our immediate concern. When the shadow regulatory authority for the greater Dublin area is established after the legislation is passed, I hope by the middle of next year, it will award the franchises.</P>
      <P>Under the 1986 Act, rather like TEAM and Aer Lingus, all employees are employees of CIE. We will take legal advice on that matter. Obviously the employees will get their rights but it may be necessary to implement a framework which will ensure that the legislative remit governing the employees will be properly fulfilled.</P>

      <Quest>if she will clarify the Government's intentions in relation to transport infrastructural development in the Dublin area in view of the number of varying proposals for underground and overground light and heavy rail proposals emanating from different recent reports; if the budget set out in the national development plan is being adhered to; if it will be extended; if so, the total envisaged expenditure up to 2006 by the State; if the proposed underground route from Ranelagh to Blanchardstown is being approved; and, if so, the cost and the time schedule involved.</Quest>

      <P>The public transport investment strategy for the greater Dublin area for the period 2000 to 2006 is set out in detail in the national development plan. Work is proceeding on the implementation of that strategy and, for example, tenders have already been issued for elements of the light rail project and the acquisition of low floor buses and additional railcars. The plan provides for a total investment of £1.6 billion, including a contingency provision of £500 million. The Dublin suburban rail strategic review has recently been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position once and for all? In the national development plan there was a contingency fund of £500 million for three projects &ndash; the Navan project, the airport project and the underground tunnel. Since then we have had the report by CIE and the new Mitsui metro proposals. Will the Minister outline in simple terms the projects to which she is committed and which she will fund? There is a huge list of projects but we do not know which are going ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated before that the Government will provide any additional resources required to implement the recommendations of those studies. The first priority, however, is to spend the £1.6 billion. There should be no doubt that the infrastructural committee, and the Cabinet, are committed to public transport. If any extra money is needed, it will be provided.</P>

      <P>CIE, its operating subsidiaries and its light rail project office are responsible for implementing the public transport projects in the national development plan and there will also be recourse to public private partnerships for appropriate projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial work has been undertaken by CIE <Col N="225" /> and my Department on preparing a detailed implementation programme to give effect to the comprehensive investment strategy outlined in the national development plan. Most of the individual projects have been identified and contracts have been already awarded and tenders issued. These include, for example, contracts for elements of the light rail project, low floor double deck buses, and additional railcars.</P>
    <P>The implementation programme will be updated to take on board the recommendations of the strategic rail study, the bus network review and the updated DTO strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the figures now available from the DTO, does the Minister recognise the urgency of making decisions? We do not doubt that money has been allocated to implement the national plan and that there is a strategy. However, no individual projects have been identified. Will any rail project be decided on during the lifetime of the Government or will the promise of decisions be the platform of the Fianna Fáil Party at the next election, as we read in the newspapers? Will the Government's only contribution be the dismantling of CIE and the reversal of previous decisions?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Dublin city and county and in the surrounding counties major planning decisions are being made which are dependent on the provision of major high capacity public transport services, none of which is in existence and about which no decisions have been made? No decisions have been made about the location, scale, nature or direction of these projects. The greater Dublin area requires 20,000 new housing units per annum. Is there any liaison between Departments? Will the Minister for Public Enterprise or any Minister fulfil the Government's promise to implement the strategic planning guidelines for Dublin which place a responsibility on all Departments to provide facilities, other than mere housing, which are required to make the quality of life in Dublin tolerable and to ensure that the economy of Dublin does not collapse?</P>

      <Quest>the position on the Government's efforts to have Sellafield closed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the matter of potential litigation which is the subject of another question, the most dramatic development relating to Sellafield has, of course, been the United Kingdom's nuclear installations inspectorate reports published on 18 February last, dealing with the control and supervision of operations at Sellafield and the falsification of safety related data for MOX fuel pellets.</P>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath, I met the UK Minister for Energy, Mrs. Liddell, and called for the closure of Sellafield because of our serious anxieties about the safety of operations there in the light of the inspectorate's report. The Taoiseach has also expressed the Government's objections to the continuation of Sellafield's operations and has stressed the Irish Government's concerns in the course of recent contacts with the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>The Government has also intensified international efforts to bring about the closure of Sellafield. We tabled a draft decision for discussion at the meeting of the commission of the OSPAR convention on the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic. In parallel with our draft decision, this meeting will also discuss how participating countries will implement the OSPAR strategy on radioactive substances which has as its objective the virtual elimination by the year 2020 of radioactive discharges into the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's draft decision for discussion at the OSPAR commission meeting highlights the increased public concern following the publi<Col N="227" /> cation of the UK nuclear installations inspectorate's reports. It also identifies reprocessing plants as a significant source of pollution to the marine environment. Accordingly, we believe the OSPAR commission meeting represents a unique opportunity to further our objective of closing down Sellafield reprocessing operations. A similar draft decision to our own has been tabled by the Danish Government.</P>
    <P>I recently visited relevant Ministers in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland to discuss the general approach to the two draft decisions tabled by Ireland and Denmark. I had already discussed our approach with the Danish Minister when he met me in Dublin on 27 March last.</P>
    <P>I found my recent Nordic visit very worthwhile. In the course of the ministerial meetings there was some discussion of a potential agreed text which took account of the Irish and Danish draft decisions. There was also some discussion of a consensus text which would be binding on all countries including the UK and France. If we do not achieve unanimity at the OSPAR commission meeting, a qualified majority decision would be binding only on the countries who vote in favour of it. Therefore, if the UK were to vote against, it would not be obliged to comply with the terms of the decision. In any event, I will keep our text on the table but, of course, I would welcome continuing contacts at official level to see what progress can be made on an alternative text. As necessary, I will keep in touch with my Nordic colleagues in the next few weeks. I am also writing to other OSPAR Ministers to gather support.</P>
    <P>I believe the tabling of the Irish and Danish draft decisions has placed significant pressure on the UK Government to consider the future of reprocessing operations. Of course, without unanimity by all participating countries, there is no guarantee of success at the OSPAR commission meeting in June. However, at the very minimum, I consider that the tabling of the Danish and Irish proposals has given a major boost to the Irish campaign to close down Sellafield reprocessing operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the tenor of the Minister of State's remarks and particularly the last sentence. I also welcome his statement, reported in the newspapers, that the June meeting in Copenhagen, to which he has referred, will be &ldquo;the beginning of the end for Sellafield&rdquo;. I welcome that remark and I ask the Minster of State to put it on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister of State agree that one of the most useful developments, from the point of view of the closing of Sellafield, was the recent decision of Bill Richardson, the United States Secretary for Energy, who reviewed the British Nuclear Fuels contract for cleaning nuclear waste in the United States? This has been a sore blow to Sellafield. What contacts has the Minister of State had with the US Government in this regard <Col N="228" /> because the support of the US Government would be extremely useful?</P>
    <P>In view of previous remarks made by me when I urged co-operation between North and South in opposition to Sellafield, has the Minister of State had discussions with anyone north of the Border and if not, in the hope that the power sharing Government in Northern Ireland will get off the ground in the next week or so, will he immediately enter into discussions with his opposite number in the Northern Ireland Executive to maximise the pressure in regard to Sellafield?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Co-operation&rdquo; was the word used by the Deputy. I appreciate greatly the co-operation and support I have received from the Members of this and the other House on this subject which has been used as a political football during the years&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and on which there is now consensus. As a result the campaign against Sellafield conducted by successive Ministers, not least my predecessor, Deputy Stagg, has been elevated to a new plane and there are opportunities to raise it further. Co-operation and interaction with our colleagues in the North should continue to prove productive. I recently addressed a conference of local authority members on these islands, some of whom would be well known to Deputy Currie. Not alone was there good interaction inside and outside the confines of the meeting, but we undertook to maintain this rapport.</P>
      <P>On the US Secretary for Energy and the major contract with Sellafield which appears to have been aborted, there is something paradoxical about the matter. While the UK nuclear industry is confronted by serious difficulties, the United States, Japan, Germany, the Nordic countries and ourselves&mdash;-</P>

      <P>I will repeat the reply I gave on this. Deputy Stagg said he did not hear me clearly. I have never been accused of not being heard. In April I submitted a paper to the Cabi net committee on infrastructural development on public private partnerships. The Deputy asked if the CIE holding company should cease to have an operational role and should no longer own the bus and rail companies. I replied that I was considering whether its dissolution would be appropriate. I stated that the future administrative arrangements for pensions would also have to be considered, as the current pension schemes apply CIE-wide. I said that I would also take into account the position of employees under the Transport Act, 1986, which provides for the transfer back to CIE of subsidiary company employees where a subsidiary is wound up.</P>

Fine Gael recently published its proposals for bus competition.

Is she open to supporting the introduction here of such a system of competition and tendering, which includes seven year licences and the provision of ample subsidies?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> The local authorities that had set up local energy management agencies by 3 March 2000 include Cork Corporation, Dublin Corporation, Galway Corporation, Cork County Council, Donegal County Council, Kerry County Council, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon County Councils, Tipperary North and South Riding County Councils and Mayo County Council. Additional local authorities that applied for funding under the EU SAVE programme before 31 March 2000 include Wexford County Council, Carlow and Kilkenny County Councils, Meath County Council and Cavan and Monaghan County Councils.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and I have taken a joint initiative at local community level to create a nationwide infrastructure of local energy management agencies aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution caused by the generation and consumption of energy. We wrote jointly on 7 March 2000 to county managers and chairpersons of local authorities to highlight the role of local authorities in continuing to meet Ireland's targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. The development and expansion of the network of local energy management agencies, sponsored by local authorities, has been identified by both of us as a priority in mobilising action at local level to help achieve Kyoto targets. The initiative is an excellent opportunity to promote energy efficiency and renewable forms of energy at local level as well as integrating environmental protection and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity next year for further applications to be made for SAVE funding under the programme and other local authorities have expressed an interest in pursuing such funding opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The local energy agencies are meritorious and useful. The reason we are endeavouring to encourage them is to ensure that the impetus at local level is maintained and increased throughout the country. The major action to date is the Green Paper which deals with energy aspects in the Kyoto context and the substantial funding put in place to fund those measures incorporated in the Green Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding is available under the EU <Col N="236" /> SAVE programme. The local energy management agencies which have been set up thus far have portrayed the usefulness of the agencies. That indicates the good work being done. What is happening at local level means that other county councils should involve themselves in same. We need them now given what we want to achieve via the Green Paper and the funding which has emanated from Government in response to that. While we are introducing measures at national level we also need action at local level. This initiative has been launched to encourage local authorities to establish energy agencies. I am pleased with the response from those coming on stream this year and those who have indicated they will come on stream next year.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the Minister for Finance to subscribe to the 1998 capital increase of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, known as MIGA. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency was created in April 1988 to encourage the flow of investments for productive purposes among member countries and, in particular, to developing member countries in many of which the perception of political risk remains a significant barrier to investment. MIGA improves the investment climate by issuing guarantees against political risk and engaging in other investment promotion activities. Prospective projects for MIGA coverage must be financially, economically and environmentally sound.</P>
      <P>MIGA does this by issuing guarantees against non-commercial, or political, risks for foreign direct investments &ndash; FGI &ndash; in its developing member countries and by providing technical assistance to governments of such countries to improve their ability to attract foreign direct investment. MIGA covers private investments, but may cover state projects where these are being privatised or are run on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>In its ten years of operation, MIGA has accomplished a great deal and has implemented several innovative initiatives. It has become a significant agency in the world of international risk capital. On the guarantee side, MIGA is now one of the largest political risk insurers in the world. Through reinsurance and coinsurance agreements and through syndication of political risk insurance, MIGA now occupies a unique and central position as a standard setter for political risk insurers. MIGA now can proceed with confidence to assume more risk in more complicated and larger projects.</P>
      <P>On the technical assistance side, MIGA's institution building activities for investment promotion agencies are highly appreciated by many host countries. MIGA's investment promotion activities are drawing the attention of many senior executives and its intermediary legal efforts are highly valued by many governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies do not need to be reminded of the importance of foreign direct investment. Over the past decade, capital inflows have laid the basis for the current success of our economy. Our pioneering approach to the attraction of foreign investment has attracted considerable international attention and many countries are seek<Col N="244" /> ing to emulate our success in utilising such capital inflows to best advantage.</P>
    <P>Many countries, however, experience considerable difficulties in attracting capital. Perceptions among investors of political risk or instability often deter them from making large or long-term investments in many Third World countries. This, in turn, retards the industrialisation of these countries and compounds existing social problems, such as endemic poverty. MIGA was created as a contribution to solving some of these problems.</P>
    <P>MIGA works closely with other agencies and its convention specifically requires it to supplement the activities of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and other international development finance institutions. It is also required to complement the activities of existing national and regional investment insurance entities. It does this through coinsurance and reinsurance with these institutions, bilateral exchanges of information and its membership of the Berne Union. It is a member of the World Bank group and shares a president and board of directors with the bank. In its operations it has particularly close ties with the IFC whose operations it supports.</P>
    <P>The MIGA guarantee is designed to promote new investments and new contributions to expand, privatise or financially restructure existing projects in developing member countries. MIGA's long-term guarantee &ndash; 15 to 20 years &ndash; which cannot be cancelled serves to mitigate investors' concerns about political risks and facilitates investments that otherwise might not be made.</P>
    <P>What does political and non-commercial risk insurance cover? MIGA offers guarantees to cover currency transfer restrictions which prevent investors or lenders from converting local currency into foreign exchange and transferring the proceeds abroad; expropriation by a host government that affects the insured investment; war and civil disturbances, including politically motivated acts of sabotage or terrorism; and breach of contract by a host government in certain circumstances. These are all actions by a host government which would jeopardise the return on the investment and, if not insured against, would deter much needed foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>MIGA covers several forms of investment, including equity, commercial bank loans, loans made or guaranteed by foreign equity holders and technical assistance and management contracts. This flexibility is designed to encourage private foreign investors to expand their activities in the developing world. MIGA is mandated to assist investments which contribute to the host country's development. The equity-related direct investments which MIGA facilitates are more stable than portfolio investments and are a necessary element of long-term sustainable development. MIGA assesses its success in terms of the number of jobs created, foreign exchange earnings and savings produced, tax and other rev<Col N="245" /> enues generated for the host government and advanced technology and management practices introduced.</P>
    <P>All MIGA insured projects must be environmentally, financially and technically sound. MIGA's technical assistance work is designed to promote the flow of investment to its developing member countries and economies in transition. These activities focus primarily on sectoral ministries and national and local investment promotion agencies. MIGA assists the agencies in capacity building and dissemination of information on investment opportunities in their countries. MIGA also supports the investment marketing efforts of agencies by organising multi-country, single sector conferences which bring together potential investors, local partners and host country investment promotion officers.</P>
    <P>The fulfilment of MIGA's objectives contributes to the development of the private sector in host countries and increases the ability of these countries to achieve economic and social development in an environmentally sustainable way. MIGA's success in promoting foreign direct investment in its developing member countries and economies in transition makes an important contribution to the attainment of the overall development objectives of the World Bank group.</P>
    <P>Global private flows to developing countries increased from US$42 billion in 1990 to US$256 billion in 1997, although 1997 witnessed a slight slowdown due largely to the crisis in East Asia. Growth has resulted from a combination of factors, including liberalisation and private sector growth in developing economies, particularly in the infrastructure sector, strong macroeconomic growth, an increase in trade and a more integrated global investment and production regime overall. Against this background, foreign direct investment continued to form the largest portion of net private flows and increased fivefold from US$24 billion to US$120 billion in the same period.</P>
    <P>The growth of foreign direct investment in developing countries acted as a catalyst for and benefited from the expansion of the investment insurance market. Concerns of project sponsors about restrictions on transfer of remittances, expropriation or nationalisation and war and civil disturbance have inhibited the flow of foreign investments in the past. The increasing availability and use of political risk insurance as a risk mitigation mechanism have boosted investors' confidence to invest in developing countries. The Berne Union, which comprises 25 investment insurers, including MIGA, reports that the use of political risk insurance has more than doubled since 1990 from US$17 billion to US$38.9 billion in 1997. In response to global trends, private investment insurers are increasing the capacity and scope of their coverage and providing longer periods of insurance.</P>
    <P>MIGA's role in relation to Africa may be of interest to Deputies. MIGA wants to respond to <Col N="246" /> the growing needs of African countries. Several African countries have undertaken rigorous structural reform and adjustment efforts and these have begun to show rewards in the form of steady economic growth. This has been termed the &ldquo;African Renaissance&rdquo; and its potential is enormous. By the end of 1998 it was clear that some African countries were close to benefiting from debt reduction processes and badly needed foreign direct investment. However, many of these are still shaky economies and they are not immune from crises, such as that which hit East Asia.</P>
    <P>MIGA's technical assistance and guarantee activities will be crucial to such African countries. The difference MIGA makes for them will be a key test by which MIGA will be evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in diversifying foreign direct investment to poorer countries. Since its inception, the agency has underwritten 62 contracts of guarantee in Africa, facilitating an estimated US$3.7 billion in foreign direct investment. In addition, the agency provides technical assistance to promote foreign direct investment in Africa by strengthening the capacity of investment intermediaries in the region to attract and retain foreign direct investment. It also disseminates information on business operating conditions and investment opportunities.</P>
    <P>MIGA obtains its resources from the capital subscriptions of its members. MIGA's initial authorised capital was SDR 1 billion. The current authorised capital is SDR 1.86 billion. The increase is accounted for by an increase of SDR 77 million in the initial capital to accommodate an increase in membership over that initially provided for and the current capital increase of SDR 786 million. As of September 1999, full membership requirements in the agency have been completed by 150 countries. The current amount of the capital subscribed by full members is SDR 1.04 billion, that is, US$1.124 billion.</P>
    <P>On 29 March 1999 the council of governors of MIGA adopted a resolution for a general capital increase. The authorised capital stock of the agency will be increased by SDR 786 million, which is US$850 million. The proposed capital increase will help underpin an underwriting strategy which envisages between US$15 billion and US$24 billion of new guarantees being issued up to 2006. After allowing for existing guarantees, cancellations, reductions, expiries and losses, MIGA's outstanding contingent liabilities would be approximately US$15.7 billion gross by the end of that period. Based on historic ratios, new guarantees of between US$15 billion and US$24 billion could facilitate an estimated US$105 billion to US$168 billion of new foreign direct investment to developing and transition countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a member of MIGA since its establishment in 1988, having ratified the convention establishing MIGA on 5 July 1989. The cost of the shares allocated to Ireland was approximately <Col N="247" /> US$4 million of which 10%, that is, US$300,000 or £280,000, was paid in cash.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed capital increase, Ireland will receive additional shares involving an additional subscription of $3 million. This will consist of a cash payment of $537,000 or £396,000 and callable capital of $2.5 million. Cash payment will be made in two equal instalments in the first two years of the capital increase. The first payment fell due before 29 March 2000. The second is to be made before 29 March 2001. Each payment will amount to £198,000. Ireland's contributions to MIGA are accountable as part of our official development assistance programme and count towards Ireland's UN GNP percentage target for overseas development assistance. Contributions to MIGA are payable from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 1 amends section 3 of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Act, 1988, to allow the Minister to subscribe to the 1998 capital increase of the agency as set out under Resolution 57 adopted by the council of governors of the MIGA on 29 March 1999. Section 2 contains the Short Title.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and Fine Gael will support it at all Stages without amendment. The scheme operated by MIGA reminds me to some degree of the export credit insurance scheme which we operated here and with which I am familiar. The scheme we are debating is different in that it insures investment in risk countries. The export credit insurance scheme insured exports from Ireland into risky economies. When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I familiarised myself with the details of the export credit insurance scheme because, on one occasion, I cancelled such insurance for Iraq. Its subsequent restoration by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, became one of the major issues at the beef tribunal. Schemes which appear to have little political content can frequently have substantial political content on certain occasions.</P>
      <P>The export credit insurance scheme was designed to ensure that private companies in Ireland could reduce their risk by being insured against the risk of not being paid for their exports. It is a scheme which operated to the benefit of Irish industry, especially during the 1980s and to some degree into the 1990s. The risk is probably less than it used to be. When Irish exporters availed of every possible opportunity to obtain a viable export market in the 1980s, they sometimes exported into very high risk economies in the sense that there was a risk they would not be paid for their produce. Such a scheme as operated was vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true now of underdeveloped countries in terms of investment. The private sector will invest in certain underdeveloped countries. However, where the political or exchange rate risk is too high, they will be reluctant to do so. <Col N="248" /> The MIGA fund, which has now been expanded by almost $2 billion, underpins the risk investors face. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that risk coverage will cover such items as &ldquo;Currency transfer restrictions that prevent investors or lenders from converting local currency into foreign exchange and/or transferring the proceeds abroad&rdquo;, the complete expropriation of the investment, the risk to an investment posed by war or civil disturbance and a breach of contract by the host government. These are considerations an investor would have in mind when considering an investment in an undeveloped country or a country which did not have the long tradition of democracy and parliamentary accountability of our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The alternative, if such insurance schemes do not exist, is that investment does not take place. I was interested by the Minister of State's statistic from the Berne Union that this type of insurance has doubled since 1990, and he mentioned the figure of $19 billion of insurance being drawn under this heading since 1990.</P>
    <P>There is nothing controversial in the Bill. At present, we have 369 shares in the agency's stock, representing a total investment of more than $3 million. It is proposed that we extend our shareholding by 281 shares, with a corresponding commitment on the capital side. Only 10% to 11% is to be paid by way of cash. Like all insurance and what we read about the Lloyd's members, it is not what has to be put up front, rather it is the guarantee one gives if the investment goes wrong of what can be called upon as the main contribution. I see in the Minister of State's proposal that the cash amount to be paid by Ireland will only be approximately £412,000 and that the callable amount will be about $2.5 million. The cash up front is low and the callable amount and the ultimate commitment by the Exchequer is significant. Nonetheless, I do not believe we have been called upon to make our full contribution until now. I would be grateful if the Minister of State, in summing up, would clarify whether, in our commitments until now, we have been called upon to produce our callable amount or whether the fund has proceeded on the basis of the 10% or 11% cash up front which we have paid.</P>
    <P>Last week we debated the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1999. The Bill we discuss now is also a vehicle for reflection on our overseas development aid programme. The same considerations arise here as were recited last week. As I said then, we should examine overseas development aid in a much wider context than we view it at present. There is always a tendency among people who observe the Dáil dealing with a matter such as this to think in terms of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> keeping an eye on the Tsar of Russia. We are so small in terms of our international role and our contribution to these great multinational funds is proportionately so small that people are sometimes of the view that we should effectively mind our manners and leave the great affairs of world <Col N="249" /> politics to the big players, such as the United States, China, Russia, France or Germany. They are also of the view that, despite our role and contribution being so small, we talk well above our contribution when we reflect on these matters.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that, if we put the issue of overseas development aid in the wider context of the great policy issues facing the world at present, the relevance of them to Ireland will be seen and our motivation should be much wider than our commitments which arise from the common humanity we share with the citizens of underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>As well as the human rights agenda to which we subscribe, there is a wider agenda on which it is in our interest to reflect. I refer again to what I said last week. The Cold War is over and that way of understanding the world, with competing eastern and western blocs with different political systems and ideologies, is now redundant. The theory that this marked the end of history and that the Cold War would be succeeded by a world order of free markets and neo-liberal democracies with everyone subscribing to common human rights values is not a tenable theory. It is not the end of history. There is a new way of looking at the world, which is ongoing competition between the great civilisations of the world.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that all the conflict points are along the fault lines between the civilisations, whether between Western Christianity and Islam as in the Balkans, between Orthodox Christianity and Islam in Chechnya or between Hinduism and Islam on the Indian sub-continent. These are where the fault lines are, but they have one factor in common. It is always a rivalry between rich and poor, or relatively rich and relatively poor. It has never been the case in world history that there has not been an issue of conflict between a heavily populated, poor country beside a richer country. The great issues facing Europe for the next 25 years or so are those of migration, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and international terrorism.</P>
    <P>If we wish to aid underdeveloped countries, to ensure there are universal education systems for children at least to the age of 14 or 15, to ensure there are universal health systems in underdeveloped countries and to ensure there is investment which brings those in underdeveloped countries up to an acceptable standard of living, there is a strong vested interest for all of us in the western democracies in doing so. It is by advocating that programme and by seeing Ireland's as a strong voice in doing so that we will have more leverage and influence in international affairs. We are not an irrelevant, small player and if we raise our voice in the right context we can be influential in these matters.</P>
    <P>Migration is a self-evident issue. As long as there are poor countries beside rich countries the citizens of the poor countries will try to live in the richer countries. We know that from our own history and it is now self-evident from what is <Col N="250" /> happening in Europe. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is dealing with the matter of asylum seekers, refugee and migration issues as if it were a temporary phenomenon. I believe &ndash; and the evidence shows it &ndash; that we are at the start of a major movement of people towards Ireland as long as our economy continues to prosper. There is an unprecedented and rapid movement of millions of people throughout the world. There are millions of economic migrants and although there are fewer asylum seekers, vast numbers of people are on the move, generally from poorer to richer countries and that will continue. It is in all our interests to ensure that the poor countries are developed and brought to a point of self-sustainable development. That requires investment and if that involves the insurance of investment through schemes such as those run by MIGA we should be fully in support of it, and we are.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the other issues facing Europe and although people may regard them as highfaluting theories, reading the accounts of the Lockerbie trial in the Netherlands brings home to us that the citizens of no country are safe from the dangers of international terrorism. In that case the allegation is one of state-based terrorism, but the issues remain the same. I do not believe in the theory of globalisation which holds that at some stage in the future the whole world will be homogenised to the degree that we will all share a common Western culture. That is to see the appearance of things rather than the reality.</P>
    <P>The reality is an 18 year old Islamic boy with secondary education wearing Levi's jeans and Adidas runners learning how to use an AK-47 rifle or wire a bomb for use in the Western world while he keeps a bottle of Coca-Cola nearby to slake his thirst. The fact that he looks overtly like any young man in Ireland does not mean that he shares the same cultural values or that the world will be at peace with itself as soon as the values of McDonald's, Adidas or Coca-Cola are prevalent values among international youth. That is not the way it will work.</P>
    <P>There are and will continue to be tensions between the great civilisations and those tensions are ultimately based on the fact that the world is a very unequal place. There are levels of inequality that the bright young people will not put up with and they will lash back. They will lash back in the manner that the weak always use against the strong, through terrorism or, in the 20th century, through the desire to get nuclear weapons. They may also decide to bail out and decide to migrate to the richer countries by hook or by crook in order to establish a new life there.</P>
    <P>It is in that wider context that the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs should be arguing these issues. Now that we are one of the most successful countries on the face of the earth we should renew our commitment to our UN overseas development aid commitments and move quickly, in a programmed way, so that we are contributing 0.7% of GNP to overseas develop<Col N="251" /> ment aid. We would be the first country in the world to do so, although we would have companions among the Scandinavian countries and we would be giving a lead. However, if the arguments are narrowly focused on the fact that the poor are poor and we should give them a better living standard or that there are certain common human values to which we subscribe and which should apply everywhere in the world or if we see ODA as a Department of Foreign Affairs manifestation of charity, then the political desire will not be found at home to support the level of tax contribution necessary and it will certainly not be sustained if the country goes into a recession.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to grasp the opportunity that is presented and to argue the case for ODA in a much wider context than is now being used. I have no doubt about his personal commitment or that of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell. There is no doubt about the political will at that level to make the necessary policy commitments, but the context and focus is far too narrow. With a wider focus and context we will not only increase the Irish contribution but we will have far more influence on our EU partners. We could make a real contribution in this context.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not controversial. It increases our contribution to the fund by using the same mechanism of acquiring shares as provided when MIGA was established in 1988. The same call-up requirements are contingent on our purchase of shares in the first instance and again, as in the IDA contribution which was updated last week, the amount of money we contribute can be reckoned as part of our ODA in line with our international commitments. The Bill is very welcome, but I would like the Minister of State to take an even stronger interest in this matter and to discuss it with his colleague in the Department of Foreign Affairs to see if more can be done in the context of the next budget.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan said this is a largely uncontroversial Bill. Yesterday I wondered how I could detain the House for 20 minutes debating it and came to the conclusion that I should not bother trying. Deputy Noonan has made it clear that I need a few more years' practice in debating the great issues of the world, and perhaps I have been remiss in my thought process in the past 24 hours in dealing with it. Deputy Noonan spoke of some of the global forces which operate, the end of history and Mr. Fujiyama's musings, etc., and there is some relevance in terms of the greater issue of ODA. I agree with most of the analysis and certainly that the notion of the end of history, when everything will be benign and happy, is not in accordance with our experience in the past number of years and is not likely to be so for some years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan omitted one great force, namely, that of globalisation, free trade, the <Col N="252" /> WTO and everything associated with it. There is no doubt that the great struggle in terms of the international order is between the forces of neo-liberalism, as manifested through the WTO and its predecessor GATT, and Third World countries which are trying to live with that new reality which is being forced on them on a bilateral basis by countries of the First World and by the multilateral institutions which are the focus of this debate. This is also relevant to MIGA.</P>
    <P>I read the mission statement of MIGA which appears on its website and which is great and wonderful. In fairness, much of what MIGA does, in so far as I understand it, is positive. It talks about carrying out research, undertaking activities to promote investment flows and disseminate information on investment opportunities in developing member countries with a view to improving the environment for foreign investment flows to such countries. It also talks about providing technical assistance and insuring political and other risks.</P>
    <P>One could say this is great, that MIGA is filling a niche which has to be filled by somebody and well and good if it is done on a multilateral basis by a multinational organisation to which we all contribute. However, one could view it in a more sceptical way given that its role is the transfer of ownership, and sometimes of control, of at times significant parts of the economies of Third World countries to multinational capital. Its role is facilitating the privatisation of industry and sometimes of the control of natural resources in Third World countries which are inevitably taken over by those who have capital, namely, multinational companies.</P>
    <P>By and large, if multinational companies engage in Third World countries they will probably do so to a good end and will hopefully set in place a chain reaction which will lead to economic growth and further investment. However, there have been examples of multinationals being facilitated in investing in Third World countries and in acquiring the natural resources of those countries and using them to generate significant wealth for themselves in some cases before leaving, with little benefit to the Third World country. There is a question as to whether the international community should be facilitating by way of insurance companies engaged in what ultimately proves to be an extremely profitable activity for them and with no great benefit to the recipient country. That is my major concern.</P>
    <P>As I understand it we are talking about insuring private investment and not intergovernmental investment and, therefore, it insures the transfer of ownership of part of the economy to a multinational. I am sceptical whether this is good in all cases.</P>
    <P>If we accept that a risk exists and that it may not always be good, the next issue is how the assessment is made, who makes it and what accountability mechanisms are in place. Deputy Noonan is correct when he says there is a temp<Col N="253" /> tation for Members and the public to think we are indulging ourselves in some way, that it is an esoteric question because our contribution is tiny. Of course that is correct, but somebody has to ask these questions. I know questions have been asked by people and politicians in the US, although not always from a political angle which we would share as questions are frequently asked by politicians of the right. We are represented on these multilateral institutions and it is important that we have direct reports and accountability from our representatives, for example, with the World Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will recall that last year when we discussed Ireland's contribution to international debt reduction we agreed that a report would be laid before the House by a certain date &ndash; I think it was 31 March each year &ndash; detailing our contribution during the course of the year to the Bretton Woods institutions. I think I am correct in saying this year's report is, unfortunately, already late. I know it is the first report of its kind which the Department has had to produce, but I hope we will be in a position to review it fairly soon. The direct experience of our representatives is the best source we have to call upon. It is very difficult to take issue with MIGA when one reads its website, its mission statement and the speech delivered by the Minister. However, NGOs have direct concerns, sometimes about individual projects, and it would be useful to have an opportunity to put those concerns to our representatives.</P>
    <P>Understandably, much of the focus of the debate last week was on Africa. We have always directed most of our ODA assistance to Africa, although a couple of Asian countries are also involved. As I understand it MIGA and much restructuring investment in Third World countries takes place in the former CIS and the former Soviet Union. MIGA has been responsible for ensuring investment, largely by multinational companies, in the countries of the Caucasus and in the central Asian republics. The Minister of State will be aware that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has also been charged with that responsibility over the past number of years. He might like to reflect in his response on how this has worked out. For example, there have been concerns that the bank has become involved in projects with which we may not be comfortable, for example, financing nuclear power stations on the Danube. The bank became involved in projects in countries such as Tajikistan where the regime seems to have less than full respect for human rights. When the EBRD was set up it was intended to encourage the restructuring and development of those economies, but also to encourage the transition of those countries, which frankly had a tradition of dictatorship, to a more politically stable condition.</P>
    <P>I appreciate I am straying a little beyond the Bill, but I would be interested to hear the Minister's reflections on how the EBRD and the <Col N="254" /> multilateral institutions are fulfilling their mandate of bringing about political transition and respect for human rights in countries in Eastern Europe and the former CIS as well as in Africa. I think too much of our focus has been on Africa, which is understandable, but we have not focused to a sufficient extent on Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Who are the typical clients of MIGA? Are we talking about relatively small investments or about companies which want to encourage investment in Third World countries? Are we talking about indigenous companies in Third World countries? In Mozambique, for example, is it possible for indigenous private sector industries to get this insurance or does it exist just to encourage foreign direct investment? I understand the latter is the case. It is necessary to try to encourage and develop the links with the indigenous private sector which facilitate sustainable economic growth, something which has been missing in the past.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1999, I was struck by the extent to which the flow of money is not circular. This comes down to the argument about loans versus grants. The IDA provides loans, not grants. On the one hand money is provided to the IDA in order to make those loans but money is also provided by way of debt relief so that loans which are owed to the IDA can be discharged. My understanding is that up to 40% of the moneys owed to the multilateral institutions, principally the World Bank and the IMF, are IDA loans which are not repaid. Will the Minister of State comment on whether this is accurate? I wonder in those circumstances whether Ireland, as a small country, would not be better off just in concentrating its efforts on bilateral grant aid rather than on the multilateral circulation of money.</P>
    <P>The only other question I have relates to the concentration of MIGA's efforts. The Minister of State mentioned that overall investment is in the order of US$24 billion whereas the amount invested in Africa is approximately US$3.7 billion. Where is MIGA's greatest undertaking? It does not appear to be in Africa and, therefore, I assume it is in Asia but I am interested to know what is the position.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan stated, all this must be seen in the context of our ODA budget. I reiterate that given our current relative economic wealth we could have done a great deal better in recent years. Last week the Minister of State outlined his intention to achieve the target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid within a few years and I welcome that. I appreciate that a little time is needed to do so. MIGA is just a tiny part of that and we should concentrate more on bilateral aid. However, in so far as this is another increase in our commitment, albeit small, I welcome it and the Labour Party will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the introduction of this Bill to subscribe <Col N="255" /> to the 1998 capital increase of MIGA. I welcome the fact that capital inflows from foreign direct investment have been made available. The Minister of State reminded us that capital inflows have formed the basis of the success of our economy but I reiterate Deputy McDowell's comment on indigenous industry. We have seen the benefit of small industry in Ireland and we should also examine links with native industry in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned that MIGA improves the investment climate by issuing guarantees against political risk and engaging in other investment promotion activities. I refer to an issue which has been raised on many occasions in the House, Shell investment in Nigeria, particularly in the Ogoni region. Abuse has been perpetrated against people in this region and Shell's investment has been questioned. Trócaire has made the point that our Government and others should examine such investment. The Nigerian Government has not allowed NGOs, such as Trócaire, and Members of this House to visit the country to examine the situation there. There were dreadful executions of people who were protesting against what was happening.</P>
      <P>Another example which has been highlighted recently is the ongoing war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We are aware of the appalling conditions in Ethiopia, yet war continues. The US Government has tried to bring pressure to bear to stop such conflicts, but Mr. David Begg reiterated on radio this morning that the countries involved are heavily armed. It is worrying, as we discuss investment, that wars continue. Mr. John O'Shea of GOAL has also referred to the fact that some of the funding which Ireland gave to Rwanda was used to buy arms and munitions. This is one area about which we must be concerned when we discuss investment and the political risk involved.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister of State highlighted the position in regard to the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. We discussed this last week during the debate on the International Development Association Bill, 1999. I support the comments of the Jubilee 2000 committee in regard to writing off debt. It produced a petition that was signed by 800,000 people in Ireland. It was presented to the G8 leaders in Germany and the committee looks forward to the next G8 meeting when it will make a strong case to write off developing countries' debt.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I am impressed by Ireland's bilateral aid programme and I congratulate the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department, in particular, on the visits she has made to countries in the bilateral aid category. Priority is given to those countries and good people from both the Department and the NGOs work in them. I hope Ireland will continue to do that but not at the expense of any other programme because programmes in priority countries have been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that several African <Col N="256" /> countries have undertaken rigorous structural reform and adjustment efforts. There has been criticism, particularly in regard to ESAF in the past, that Ireland may have laid down too strict guidelines on structural reform which could have led to a reduction in education and health programmes. We must be careful that we do not impose programmes on countries through ESAF. During the debate on the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1999, the Minister of State referred to the distinction between grants and loans. He stated that when the next replenishment of the IDA is examined, we may move more towards grants because there is not much point in continuing to provide loans if countries sink deeper into debt. I call on the Minister of State to finalise his thinking in regard to the provision of grants in future.</P>
    <P>I support what has been said about our overseas development aid programme. The Minister of State has been positive about achieving the target of 0.7% of GNP for such aid over a specified period. Obviously we want that timeframe spelt out as soon as possible but we know it cannot happen overnight. However, we have made good progress since the cutbacks in the 1980s and I look forward to the increase in ODA as a percentage of GNP because we will then be in a position similar to countries, such as Norway and Sweden, which have exceeded that target. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Listening to the Minister of State and Deputy Noonan one would imagine we were discussing a loan to the Little Sisters of the Poor for a worthy project in a poor country in Africa, such were the terms of virtual endearment they bestowed on the two organisations with which MIGA deals. Far from being charitable organisations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which orchestrate the investment of western companies and countries in the poorer countries of the world, are vicious instruments of globalisation. They are also vicious instruments of global capitalism which rape the resources of the Third World in a systematic fashion and exploit its people to a horrific degree.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the discussion we have had on this Bill, considering that last year the House discussed the structural adjustment programmes. At that stage Deputies made good and accurate points about the role of multinationals in the Third World. Loans from the IMF and World Bank are contingent on structural adjustment programmes which form a vicious attack on the public infrastructure and assets of the countries they are supposed to assist. They insist on public assets being privatised, State expenditure on social services being slashed, and they slash trade barriers to suit themselves and the multinational investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programmes turn poor countries into loan repayment machines. That has been the experi<Col N="257" /> ence over the past 20 years. The MIGA programme claims that while the IMF and World Bank reforms are a bitter pill to swallow, they lay the basis for major economic growth and, therefore, for higher living standards for the poorest people in the world. Unfortunately, the evidence demonstrates the opposite. The IMF and World Bank have created a huge debt trap in the Third World. The overwhelming debt has led poor countries to allocate enormous portions of their national income towards paying interest on debt. The sick logic of international capitalism and its so-called investments in the Third World means that money is flowing from the world's poorest people into richer countries.</P>
    <P>Debt is one of the most important weapons with which the big capitalist powers dominate poor countries and extract the maximum return. Debt is used callously and calculatedly as a leverage to pry open new markets and gain access to cheap labour and raw materials for major western firms. To get new credit and avoid defaulting on existing debt repayments, poorer countries must accept the dictates of the IMF and World Bank. Today, the underdeveloped world owes a total of $2.5 trillion in international debt to big banks, the IMF and the World Bank. The developing nations pay the West nine times more in debt repayments than they receive in aid from western countries.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have seen the tragic example of the devastating floods in Mozambique where western governments sat on their haunches for days on end while the lives of desperately poor and beleaguered people were lost. The livelihoods of those affected by the floods were wiped out. A mere $40 million in aid was contributed. It is all very well to pretend that it is all about charity, but Mozambique pays more than $70 million a year in debt repayments to western banks. There has been a media blitz about what has been given in aid and the rescue efforts, when they eventually got going, but there has been no reporting on the real story which is the blind robbery of a poor country. In Mozambique, while diseases such as cholera and malaria are spreading rapidly in the wake of the floods, only 1.1% of gross domestic product is spent on health care. That represents a fall of 75% after a decade of IMF-imposed austerity programmes.</P>
    <P>Mozambique is only one country which finds itself in this situation. From 1982 to 1990, $927 billion was loaned to underdeveloped countries but in the same period debtor nations paid $1,345 billion to international banks in debt service payments. Debtor countries began the 1990s 61% more in debt than they were in 1982. That has been the experience of sub-Saharan Africa and other countries whose debt has increased dramatically. During the 1990s, the gross national product for the region fell by 2.2% per year, while <i>per capita</i> income declined. This is the result of the so-called friendly embraces of institutions whose activities the Minister wants this <Col N="258" /> country to underwrite through the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen to what a former World Bank official said when he summed up the situation, no doubt after leaving the bank. In regard to Latin America, the official said that &ldquo;not since the conquistadors plundered Latin America has the world experienced a financial flow in the direction we see today&rdquo;. Unfortunately, that is the situation in many poor countries. Latterly, we have seen the IMF and World Bank intervening in Russia, allegedly to restructure the economy and supposedly in the interest of the Russian people. However, there have been catastrophic results from this so-called shock therapy. The Russian economy has gone into free fall with its GDP plummeting by 60% since 1991 &ndash; an unprecedented decline for any country in peace time.</P>
    <P>The globalising trends that have been promoted by these agencies have led to a grotesque increase in inequality, poverty and misery in the developing world. In reality, the Bill is about underwriting investments in poor countries and, thus, obviating any risk to investors. Deputy McDowell asked who was being underwritten by this programme and, of course, it is the foreign investors. In other words, they can invest in areas where they would otherwise be at risk if the investment was based purely on commercial considerations and did not consider the political situation. They want western taxpayers to pick up the tab if things go wrong in their profit-making enterprises. That should not be condoned and we should not underwrite such a situation.</P>
    <P>For example, what would be insured? Currency transfer restrictions prevent investors or lenders from converting local currency into foreign exchange and transferring the proceeds abroad. Will the Minister explain what that means? For example, will corruption in some of the brutal leaderships and bureaucracies that dominate these poor societies, in which multinationals, the IMF and the World Bank are investing and dictating policy to, be underwritten by this scheme? In current circumstances there is not much chance of expropriation by a host government that will affect the insured investment. Governments are being forced to divest themselves of enterprises and state concerns rather than the opposite.</P>
    <P>This country should not be involved with the IMF and the World Bank. It should not give succour to these predatory organisations that have left a legacy of disaster in the poorer countries of the world. What is called for is an entirely independent and new approach. The revolt in Seattle in the autumn, when the World Trade Organisation attempted to gather to further organise the exploitation of the poor countries, should serve notice that a revolt is beginning to emerge in those countries which were represented in Seattle, and among the working people of the United States and other countries, against the carve up of the world on the terms of multi<Col N="259" /> national corporations. Five hundred corporations currently dominate the world. A few handfuls of private individuals, Bill Gates included, own more wealth than the bottom 50% of all humanity. That has been the legacy of the policies of the World Trade Organisation, the IMF and the World Bank and it is in that the Minister wants to further involve this country.</P>
    <P>Critically necessary services wield enormous power and economic leverage over the economy. They should not be in the hands of faceless private individuals and corporations whose only aim is to maximise profit at the expense of ordinary people and of the poorest of the poor. Banks and the financial institutions should be in public ownership on a world scale. Finance and investments should be planned on the basis of need, not on the basis of the greed of the multinational companies. All debts should be cancelled. The poor of the world have paid and repaid their debt to western countries and to western banks. Such debt cancellation as has happened has been merely to wipe the eye of those countries and to create the impression among young people, NGOs, etc. in the west who are concerned about the plight of the poorer countries that they are charitable organisations. Real debt cancellation would mean a complete cut of the shackles. That must go with the overthrow of the rotten dictatorships and corrupt regimes in the poorer countries where these multinational companies operate and where they make no contribution to the restoration of democracy, as we have seen in Nigeria. They assisted in the crushing of the democratic environmental movement in Ogoniland, etc. If people are really interested in assisting the poor peoples of the world, they should take an independent stand with independent investment and utilise the resources democratically for the majority of the people, rather than underwriting some of the most predatory organisations humanity has known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail of the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to congratulate the Minister of State on introducing this legislation. I assure him he has our full support in that endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy, as Deputy Higgins has just done, to get emotional and hysterical about the position in these countries. It is wrong to say the abolition of the World Bank, the IMF and the institutions that are helping to solve some of these problems would in some way advance the cause of the people who are suffering poverty, disease, hardship, deprivation and death in the underdeveloped countries. That would make a bad situation immensely worse and would put more lives at risk. The proposals put forward in the contribution we have just heard would be an irresponsible approach for any government to adopt. It is fine to be lofty in ideals and in doctrine but they do not achieve anything. The policies that have just been put forward would have disastrous con<Col N="260" /> sequences for the poorest of the poor, the people we claim to support.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, I had the opportunity to visit the poorest of the poor in Tanzania, Lesotho, Mozambique and elsewhere. One could hardly grasp the enormity of the problem in these places without seeing it at first hand. I was glad the Taoiseach recently had the opportunity to see the hardship, poverty and disease being suffered, especially in the huge countries in Africa where there seems to be little prospect of dealing effectively with the problems. The Taoiseach put on record the Government's support for the efforts required to make some impact on a situation which is rapidly deteriorating, despite all the work done in the past.</P>
    <P>I have seen the NGOs and the State agencies working side by side. We had the opportunity to discuss with NGOs here the way they might co-operate better and work together with the State agencies to deal with some of the problems that are blatantly obvious to anybody who cares to follow what is happening in these countries. Anyone who saw the situation in Tanzania, where the poorest of the poor are suffering hardship, deprivation and death, would be more than happy to support any measure that would help to alleviate the problems there.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House is a further plank in the campaign to build bridges between the less well off sections of the international community and those whom we have described as needing immediate and substantial financial, technical, scientific and medical assistance. This measure in particular is valuable because it will help to alleviate their suffering. This is a very good agency, a type of guarantee agency set up only ten or 12 years ago but which already has achieved remarkable success. Rather than criticising an agency like this we should support it. The Government has adopted the correct approach in bringing forward this legislation which will further assist the agency to consolidate its work and give the guarantees which are fundamental to ensure that development takes place.</P>
    <P>Private financial agencies and insurance companies should be encouraged to invest further in this area of insurance to enable some of the major reconstruction and development to be undertaken. It is necessary to involve the international community in this area. This fund is a good one and is, as the Minister said, achieving results. It indicates definite advancement at a time of difficulty. If Governments make a commitment to an agency such as this, a guarantee fund to help deal with the political risks which undermine the prospects of investment, not only will they make substantial progress but private investment and insurance agencies will be encouraged by the lead they are giving and will match it, pound for pound, if not more.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to NGOs for their work in overseas development. When I was Minister of State, almost nine years ago, we had the benefit of a <Col N="261" /> combined meeting in Iveagh House of the agencies involved in the overseas aid programme. It was a revelation to see the huge volume of work being undertaken. We also discovered there were opportunities for better co-operation between State agencies and non-governmental organisations. This is apparent to anyone who has seen what is being done in Mozambique and other places. There are opportunities for a substantial increase in the volume of trade. When I met the President of Tanzania, he said that of all the aid and finance we were making available to them, they needed better access for their commodities to world markets because it would alleviate the demand on the overseas aid budget from various countries.</P>
    <P>A balance must be struck between what can be done through guarantees such as this one and direct cash payments to the UN and other agencies. This must be done, above all, with regard to the operation of world trade so people can put their commodities &ndash; bananas, coffee or whatever &ndash; on the market which is getting more competitive and difficult to operate in. Those in business recognise the handicaps world trade is placing on economies &ndash; our farming community has also been affected. We should not underestimate the importance of the world trade regime which is taking shape. Governments of developing countries must be conscious of their financial circumstances and must find ways to accommodate these in the world trade negotiations, in order to give them access to markets.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that while we are introducing this guarantee fund which will provide political insurance, some developing countries are selling huge amounts of armaments to people so they can continue to kill and place hardship on innocent communities. We should attach a condition to this legislation to ensure that countries who participate in this agency give undertakings that they will not be involved in the selling of armaments to countries, many of which make no secret of the fact that they are storing ammunition. Much hardship and deprivation could have been avoided were it not for the huge revenue diverted to the purchase of armaments for ethnic wars. I will not go into detail as it is there for anybody to see.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation. We should invest in this area further. I am not sure if there is a provision for an annual report to be presented by the agency to the Houses so we can see the areas it is involved in and the work it is undertaking. If it is fully explained to the public what is involved in this, they will be more than willing to give it their backing. In the past year there has been a tendency in the international community to reconsider their overseas aid programmes and curtail them. This would be a devastating move by such countries, many of which are wealthy, efficient and have extensive resources at their disposal. It would be a retrograde step to curtail these programmes after all the human and financial investment in overseas aid programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> This legislation is a vote of confidence in our agencies and those involved in NGOs throughout the international community. We must encourage them to continue their valuable work so we can bring an end to the poverty, hardship, starvation, death and destruction we have seen in many of the developing countries. This legislation is useful, positive and worthwhile. I fully support it and every Member should do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. I appreciate the general, if not unanimous, welcome for this Bill. The debate on the capital increase of MIGA offers our Legislature the opportunity to consider issues relating to economic growth in developing countries and the role of the private sector in generating such growth. In concluding this Stage, I will address a number of points raised by Deputies and comment further on the role of MIGA, particularly its future strategic direction.</P>
      <P>I was struck by Deputy Noonan's arguments when he spoke on the IDA debate &ndash; unfortunately I was unable to reply as I had to leave the House &ndash; and found myself reflecting on them at home over the weekend. It is interesting that the issue arose again today. His central point related to the impact of economic refugees and some of the predictions which are not as rose-tinted as they might be. We must address the reality which Ireland is now experiencing. We will continue to experience the impact of the difference between the developed world and the undeveloped world and people making the strategic decision to move rather than waiting for something to happen in their country.</P>
      <P>I agree that one of the key ways to stop people moving is to give them a real economy in their countries, raise their standard of living and create the opportunities which they perceive as existing in the more developed parts of the world. This can be done by taking a broader view of the impact of the funding we provide to the developing parts of the world, multilaterally and bilaterally. We have experienced substantial economic growth in recent years. The ODA budget in 1992 was £40 million and last year it was £178 million, which is a phenomenal increase. This is still about 0.31% of GNP. There is a collective will in this House to reach the figure of 0.7%. If we achieve this, we will have a platform from which we can further discuss the arguments made by Deputy Noonan on this Bill and on last week's IDA debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are moving in this direction. I am not directly involved in all the related legislation but I have noticed that our role, multilaterally and bilaterally, in the developing world and poor countries has become greatly enhanced. Publicly there is a greater understanding of our commitments and people are supportive of the approach successive Governments have taken. That is not to say, however, that we have achieved every<Col N="263" /> thing we want to achieve. There are legitimate arguments to be made and listened to.</P>
    <P>There was some confusion about MIGA insurance. It is clearly and specifically political risk insurance. Deputy Noonan mentioned export credit insurance. I was involved in many of the debates dealing with normal commercial risks in the 1980s and 1990s. The thrust of this Bill, which was largely misunderstood by Deputy Joe Higgins, has nothing to do with insuring commercial risk at all. It focuses on the political risk and stability of the regimes which exist in some of these emerging countries. They are two separate issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised nuclear issues and the EBRD, a meeting of which I will attend this weekend. I have been involved in some of the debates since I entered office three years ago on this issue and I emphasise that the EBRD focuses on safety. Any funding is to ensure that existing nuclear power stations, some of which are akin to Chernobyl, are as safe as possible. An accident at a nuclear power station will have an impact on us as much as anyone else. The issue was very much to the fore of a meeting I attended in Kiev in the Ukraine, not far from Chernobyl. The EBRD does not provide investment for the building of new nuclear facilities but to ensure safety at existing nuclear power stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a mix of the two in some cases. In the Czech Republic it is facilitating the construction of a new nuclear power station so existing stations can be closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point but there are only one or two cases of that nature. I should have said that it will not fund an increase in capacity. That case involved extreme circumstances and was the only way forward. By and large, it is not something in which we would want to be involved. We have played a significant role in making that point at EBRD level and keeping it at the top of the agenda when dealing with the nuclear issue. That should be the focus for the EBRD.</P>
      <P>Critics of MIGA may argue that many countries have their own national political insurance agencies and that, in addition, private insurers have entered the market. When MIGA was set up, there was an implication that it would take on board all insurance functions and would squeeze private and national insurers out of the market. That is not what happened, the market developed with MIGA, private sector and national insurers becoming directly involved to create what has proved to be a stable regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked if any of the callable amount has been called in. It has not. Of all of the projects, <Col N="264" /> there is only one over which there is a question mark and it is being looked at now. MIGA's track record is extraordinary. Nothing has gone wrong and we do not anticipate that anything will. On the existing amount from 1998, nothing has been called on.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked where the funding was being made available. The portfolio distribution by host region is, approximately, Europe and central Asia, 23%, Asia, 20%, Latin America and the Caribbean, 48% and Africa 8%.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned contributing to the IDA twice. We contribute via a direct subscription to the IDA and in debt relief for IDA debt of HIPC countries. There is nothing inconsistent in that. The IDA relies on reflows from existing loans to fund further concessional financing. Contributing to relief on IDA debt allows the IDA to carry on at the same level. It is necessary to keep the level of aid up and the only way to do that is to recycle the finance. The system works. We also contribute to debt relief on a bilateral basis.</P>
    <P>The quality of the investments was raised. MIGA reviews its investments on the basis of the developmental impacts and, clearly, it would want companies to become involved through inward and foreign direct investment in these countries with projects which will have a real impact on the economy and which will create sustainable jobs. It is not just about going in, raping a country's resources and leaving again. That happened in the past and I do not deny that, but in the context of the qualitative approach MIGA is taking, there has been a substantial structural change of approach in IMF and World Bank thinking in realising the social elements which need to be put in place when investing in these countries.</P>
    <P>The ability of the host country's indigenous industry to access the insurance risk was raised. It is purely focused on foreign direct investment but there is a facility where a partnership has been formed between the company coming in with foreign direct investment and a local company. There is some degree of ability, although the scope is narrowly focused because it is concerned with foreign direct investment. It is not about commercial risk, it is about the political risk which must be taken by many of the companies involved before they will invest in a country or regime. We are not talking about underwriting commercial risk. We are simply compensating for possible action by host Governments which might deter much needed foreign investment and to date, the track record is excellent. Only one case is being investigated at present.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if Deputy Higgins had not clouded some legitimate points either by not reading the Bill or by choosing not to understand it. His tirade of rhetoric was of a bygone age and has no relevance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not look at the facts. He confused so many arguments that no one could follow what he was trying to say. The one or two points in his speech which had some merit were not helped by the use of outdated rhetoric and language which has no relevance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy did not once mention good governance. The Deputy seems to think it is the fault of everyone else that certain things are wrong. Everyone accepts that the World Bank and the IMF have made mistakes in dealing with these issues. However, in dealing with many of these countries, the issue of good governance is coming to the fore. Wherever I go and whenever I speak, I insist that Ireland emphasises this issue. Good governance is essential if we are to take the poorest of the poor countries out of their difficulties. We see the results of abuse by many regimes in the starvation and poverty with which their peoples are forced to live.</P>
      <P>The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency hopes to improve its effectiveness by concentrating on four key strategic areas. On the issue of development impact, MIGA intends to increase substantially the scale of its guarantee operations as technical services, as demand far exceeds the agency's capacity to meet it. In doing so it will continue to ensure the selection of guarantee projects meets the objectives of the agency and are consistent with the World Bank's country assistance strategy, the CAS.</P>
      <P>On the issue of financial soundness, MIGA will maintain prudent underwriting, sound risk management and strong internal controls while continuing to maintain the balanced structure of its portfolio and pursuing risk diversification by sector and country. MIGA's development objectives must be pursued within the institutional requirement to maintain, under all circumstances, its abilities to meet its financial obligations.</P>
      <P>On the issue of client orientation, MIGA needs to become more responsive to client risk mitigation needs in terms of its products and pricing. In this regard, MIGA intends to streamline its guarantee operations to ensure delivery of its products to clients in the most timely way possible. MIGA also sees the need to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy, effectively to promote FDI through the collaborative efforts of guarantees and investment marketing services. The key to this approach is for MIGA to define its target audiences and utilise the media and Internet to disseminate information about its products and services to its stakeholders.</P>
      <P>On the issue of partnerships, MIGA will seek to expand its collaboration with national insurers and will expand its training for national insurance schemes in developing member countries. It will also continue its collaboration with private insurers with a view to contributing to the further development of the private investment insurance market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, MIGA plays a positive role in attracting vital foreign direct investment in developing member countries. Such investment is <Col N="266" /> pivotal in these countries' efforts to obtain substantial poverty reduction through economic growth in the private sector. By working in partnership with the World Bank, host governments, other insurers and civil society, MIGA is in a unique position to exert a positive influence on growth and economic development in developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned the House was agreed that the Bill is not controversial. It merely seeks to repeal legislation which is a hangover from a protectionist era and will contribute to a more competitive marketplace in the cement industry.</P>
      <P>When I spoke, I set out a number of questions which I hope the Minister can answer because a great number of people outside the House are awaiting answers to those questions. They will be particularly interested in the impact of the Bill on the cost of house building. The Bill is otherwise an innocuous item of legislation and merely takes redundant legislation off the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>In terms of competition, will the Minister of State address the long-running controversy affecting small producers in the industry and the alleged abuse of dominant position? I am sure he is familiar with the organisation known as Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance in which the principal might be a gentleman by the name of Mr. Seamus May, who I recall was in touch with me a number of years ago. I have not talked to him in the past couple of years. In current correspondence in anticipation of the Bill being introduced in the House he again draws attention to his conviction and, apparently, that of the small producers with him in the alliance that they have been the victims of anti-competitive practices in the industry. This is a good opportunity for the Minister of State to tell us what he knows about the matter and what his assessment is of the claims being made. I am aware that it featured in a series of court actions, distinct from the one to which I referred in Kinnegad, in terms of restoring a company by the name of Amantiss to the companies register. It is important that the opportunity is taken to clear the air. While it is not a sin to have an 80% share of the market or to hold a dominant position, it is, legally speaking, a sin to abuse that dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important issue in another regard. I understand from expert sources, including inside the public service, that arguably the biggest problem confronting the country is not the £42 billion investment plan but whether we have the expertise, skills and manpower to implement it. For example, it is extraordinary that only two tenders were received for a recent major road project. The Taoiseach has made a statement, which I understand perfectly, to attract workers and contractors from outside the country. The lesson is that for a major building project such as this one will not attract German or French contractors, one is essentially looking to British contractors in the hope that they will bring workers with them, assuming that the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="268" /> Reform, will let them in. We need them if we are to put this infrastructure programme in place.</P>
    <P>This is not separate from the issue being discussed. I would be greatly obliged if the Minister of State addressed some of these issues. While I am all in favour of tidying up, doing the housekeeping and taking a redundant Act off the Statute Book, I cannot the see the point in us being here otherwise. Nobody has looked for a licence in the past 20 years. If memory serves me correctly, it was observed more in the breach than in the observance. Other than that I cannot see the relevance. I ask the Minister of State to address specifically the claims being made by Mr. May and indicate whether it is considered that there is cause for concern about the matters raised in respect of the abuse of dominant position and the use of anti-competitive practices to do down or put out of the marketplace small producers or to prevent the entry into the marketplace of new producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State and Deputy Rabbitte said this is not earth shattering legislation, but the question that comes to mind is, from where did it come. Of all the work that needs to be done why are we discussing the Cement (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1999? I was not aware of any particular problems or lobby on the issue. Of all the legislation that needs to be tidied up or repealed why did this Bill jump out of the concrete block? When it was placed on my desk and I saw it was being sponsored by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment I thought it would not cause any particular stir but I was wrong. Funnily enough, it has generated more interest than a Bill of the size of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill and I have been surprised by some of the information forwarded to me. While everyone who has been in touch with me is in favour of the repeal of the legislation in question, the Bill has stirred up some sleeping ghosts, particularly for small producers.</P>
      <P>It is important that we look at the concrete industry. In the last week I have received a copy of a study by KPMG entitled A Strategy for the Concrete Industry in Ireland from the Irish Concrete Federation. It contains some useful information on the scale of the industry and places in context the matter I wish to raise, the Competition Authority and the complaints received about the failure to examine the industry.</P>
      <P>Total output in 1999 amounted to £992.8 million, of which the extraction sector &ndash; stone, sand and gravel &ndash; accounted for £357 million. The manufacturing sector &ndash; readymix concrete &ndash; accounted for £253.7 million; concrete blocks, £122.1 million; precast concrete, £120 million, and asphalt, mortar and other products, £140 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that we are discussing the concrete industry at a time when the issues of housing, building and rezoning are being discussed inside and outside the House. We have reached the stage where there is a sense that nobody should <Col N="269" /> be making concrete and cement and nobody should be building anything, that it is an issue we should not discuss but that is foolish. It is a major industry and we have to look at who runs it and how it is run.</P>
    <P>Stone, gravel and sand extraction and readymix concrete etc. which account for £464 million are the basic ingredients for the housing, commercial, agricultural, infrastructural and contracting sectors. Another £11.6 billion will be allocated for house builders, local authorities, business, Government, farming, public bodies, developers and investors. That reflects how intrinsically the concrete industry is built into our lives. One cannot put down flagstones in one's back garden, a path or build a chimney without using concrete products. The concrete industry is all pervasive.</P>
    <P>This report indicates that the industry's revenue has increased by more than 40% between 1997 and 1999. More than anything else, that gives an indication of the booming economy, the increase in development in agriculture, business, industrial sites, housing and other sectors of commercial activity. A survey of the industry shows that the output volume of the industry, rather than price increases, has led to the industry's increase in revenue and that the price of products has remained fairly stable.</P>
    <P>According to CIF published data, the annual average price increase in manufactured concrete products for readymix mortar and concrete is 1.7% per annum and 2.2% per annum in respect of concrete blocks. Those figures are well below the rate of inflation. According to this KPMG report, that element does not appear to be the reason house prices have soared out of all proportion. Other factors rather than the price of products in the concrete industry have contributed to that.</P>
    <P>According to the figures in this document, even with that increase, it appears the industry is flexible and can increase its capacity without too much difficulty. Demand was catered for during 1999. A major problem arises in respect of the Government's national development plan which provides for £40 billion in investment. Concern has been expressed that the industry will not be able to produce enough or keep up with what will be required to deliver on what is provided for in the national development plan. I am sure that is of concern to the Minister. Investment of £40.6 billion is expected up to 2006, of which approximately £17.6 billion, or 43%, will be directed exclusively towards public infrastructure and there will be additional regional spending. There is a concern we may not be able to deliver on what is provided for in the national development plan &ndash; a concern beginning to be felt by IBEC and others.</P>
    <P>The Government has not only been extremely tardy in setting up structures for public private partnerships, but it does not seem to have an understanding of how they will operate. We have two examples of how they have operated in terms of the East Link bridge and the Westlink bridge, <Col N="270" /> but the system in that regard then appears to have fallen down. There does not appear to be a serious effort by the Government to deal with public private partnerships. For that reason I am concerned we will not be able to deliver on what is provided in the national development plan. I hope the Government is considering seriously not only what is provided for in the national development plan but how those proposed developments can be delivered.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will impact severely on the construction industry. The debate on this Bill presents us with an opportunity to examine how the plan will impact on the construction industry. There will be direct financing of public built infrastructure and co-financing of building investments will be encouraged. That will apply to industries, private agricultural investment and the service industry sectors. The concrete industry will have to deliver on private sector housing and private sector retail commercial development. It must be able to meet the challenges to which those developments will give rise.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, it is estimated that approximately 48,000 new dwellings will be built over the next five years or so. It is also estimated that there will be a 4.3% increase, on average, in the building of offices. The rate of growth in the industrial sector will probably not be quite as fast as in previous years, partly due to the current labour shortages.</P>
    <P>As I am addressing my comments to a Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I want to tell him that I believe we have reached a point where IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will have to seriously consider whether they need to accommodate every investor who wants to invest in Ireland. We must be sure we can match the advantages we offer foreign investors with the labour needs they will require, otherwise companies will open here and then close with the consequent disappointment, pain and the relocation of workers who will probably have to sell houses they bought. The investment of IDA grants in such companies will take years to regain in revenue, as the building from which such a company operated may have to be sold.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage where we must be more selective. I do not want investment curtailed, but we must ensure we can deliver on what is required in respect of foreign investment. Matters such as the provision of toxic waste disposal facilities must be considered. If foreign industry is invited to invest here, we must ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place to allow it to work effectively and safely in an environmentally friendly way. There is no point in turning a blind eye to that need.</P>
    <P>We all extol the work of the IDA. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment visited India recently. The first thing she had to do on her return &ndash; as each Minister does on returning from such a visit &ndash; was to write a statement on the number of new industries that will invest here <Col N="271" /> and the number of new jobs that will be created. It will take a courageous Minister to take a stand and say we should slow down the pace a little and not accept every industry that wants to invest here, as we may not have enough people to staff such industries. The demands in respect of such investment will be enormous and we must ensure we do not get a bad name throughout the world for not being able to provide what is needed to meet demand.</P>
    <P>A total of 5,000 public sector houses will be built annually over the next five years. That will require substantial financial investment and their provision will put a major strain on the construction industry. I hope that industry will be able to match what is required to make that provision.</P>
    <P>There are labour shortages in a number of the skilled jobs and also in the semi-skilled and low skilled jobs in the construction industry. Unless 7,000 or 8,000 workers had come here from England and elsewhere to work in the construction industry, we would be in a dire situation.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State of the dangers attached to the lack of action by the Minister for Education and Science with regard to apprentices. Apprentices are required to complete six years training. One phase in terms of education is completed with FÁS and phase 4 and phase 6 are supposed to be completed in the colleges of technology, where apprentices are required to participate in full-time education for a period. Without completing that moiety of an apprenticeship an apprentice cannot qualify. At present, particularly in the construction industry, some apprentices are not moving from phase 3, which comprises on-the-job experience, to phase 4 to complete their education moiety because places are not available and the colleges will not provide them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take this matter on board. The issue is appropriate to this legislation, as we are discussing the cement industry, which is the lifeblood of the construction industry. Apprentices, whether completing bricklaying, electrical, plumbing or other apprenticeships, required by the construction industry must be able to complete their training.</P>
    <P>We have heard about bricklayers who can command a £1,000 a week at a minimum. To retain workers, some builders have given them not only pay increases but bonuses for each job they have completed. This is a dire situation which will worsen if Minister does not take note of it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the capacity of the local authorities to get people to build local authority houses. I have been informed by Fingal County Council that if it wants to build nominee houses it cannot get anybody to tender for them because the construction workers are involved in the big projects. Therefore, somebody on a housing list has to wait while the person buying a private house will get his or her house and industry will get its buildings. Local authorities cannot pay workers such high amounts of money for local <Col N="272" /> authority work. In county councils the houses approved for building in 1998 are two years behind. It takes two years to get to the point where they are built and occupied. This causes chaos for those on the housing list and people are suffering. I hope the Minister will take an interest in this issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Competition Authority, its lack of resources and the fact that it has never conducted an investigation into the alleged cartel in the cement industry. The enforcement officer of the Competition Authority recently handed in his resignation on the basis that he had not got the resources to carry out investigations into some of the cartels that exist. It is estimated that 1% could be added to our GDP if the Competition Authority was working properly. It is a scandal that the Minister, Deputy Harney, has refused to give the Competition Authority its due resources. There are no gardaí attached to it. The economists, with the exception of two economists with four and eight months experience between them, have left. I am not saying they are not up to the job, they are just inexperienced. There is no lawyer attached to the Competition Authority. Yet the Minister has already announced that her pet project, the company law enforcement agency &ndash; legislation for which has not yet gone though the House &ndash;  will have eight gardaí and 30 plus staff while the Competition Authority is left bereft of resources to conduct its investigations.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, journalist Gerry Byrne said a major probe into cartels and other anti-competitive conditions in the quarrying and concrete industry collapsed earlier this year when the Competition Authority failed to get additional resources from the Civil Service. He made a comparison with the telecommunications regulator who has a staff of 50 to look at one industry while the Competition Authority, the poor relation, is left aside and cannot get the necessary resources. I have a letter from somebody else who asked the Competition Authority to look into the co-operative creameries. The reply dated 14 April 2000 read:</P>
    <P>I regret I have to advise you that at the present time the Authority is not in a position to pursue the matter due to lack of resources.</P>
    <P>If there is a complaint about any industry that might be involved in anti-competitive practices, lack of resources should not prevent the Competition Authority from investigating it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister received, as we all did, a document from the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance. If the Minister has not got a copy of this document I will hand her mine. The document is scathing of the way in which Cement Roadstone has been able to build up a monopoly. Cement Roadstone will say it is not a monopoly and will refer to various companies. There are a number of companies which appear to be independent but when one looks at them that is not the case. In an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 17 October 1999, CRH has confirmed that it controls <Col N="273" /> a second quarry company in the south west and goes on to mention that it has a 51% interest in Joseph Hogan of Glin and Foynes, County Limerick and mentions other companies in which it has a 51% interest. However, because the companies are so small, CRH did not consider it necessary to include them in the annual report.</P>
    <P>The accusation is that there has been a hidden buying up of independent companies to give the impression that those independent companies, with their own names, are still independent when they are part of the Cement Roadstone Holdings cartel. Will the Minister give a commitment at the end of this debate to give the Competition Authority an opportunity to look at the allegations? It may be that not all the facts stated in this document are correct. It may also be the case that the facts which Cement Roadstone Holdings will give me are not all correct. An examination of this industry is needed to see where the truth lies. We need to ensure that in repealing this legislation we do not leave matters in the industry in a bad state.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Bill we must ask why it has taken so long to introduce the Bill. It is probably due to pressure from the European Union. It gives us an opportunity, however, to reflect on the nature of Cement Roadstone Holdings. CRH has been an enormously powerful company. It has played a pivotal role in IBEC. It has had a monopoly position. That is unhealthy not only for the economy but for politics. The nature of CRH reveals the very incestuous nature of Irish business. We need only look at the make-up of CRH and the overlap between it and other companies to begin to get the full picture. The chairman, Mr. Barry, is the deputy governor of the Bank of Ireland; Howard Kilroy, the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, is on the board of CRH. Don Godson&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct. I have checked the record of previous speeches and I know this is the case. I am not trying to be obstreperous, rather to indicate that the Governor of the Bank of Ireland is also on the board of CRH. If ever there was a company that was a home to the golden circle this is it. We can consider also Mr. Des Traynor, the bagman for Mr. Haughey, and his role in the controversy of Glen Ding. Mr. Traynor carried out his activities in terms of the Ansbacher accounts from the headquarters of CRH.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company has been involved in many different activities. I have a number of questions to put. How is it that CRH has 100% of the explosives industry? How was it allowed to abuse its monopoly position for so long? Why were those family concerns, mentioned by Deputy Owen, bullied and why do they feel so aggrieved? <Col N="274" /> Why was CRH allowed to manipulate the market to the extent that cement prices were the highest in Europe at one stage? Deputy Owen said she was not sure whether the allegations contained in the document can be borne out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. I have met with these people and I have to take them in good faith. They appear to be extremely sincere and very aggrieved at what has happened over the years. Why did the Oireachtas allow the introduction of the cement certification scheme against EU law? In 1969 why was Roadstone allowed to take over Irish Cement? Why did not the Government intervene?</P>
      <P>These questions need to be answered and the answer is simple &ndash; these people had enormous influence. Later we will debate the question of corporate donations. We know that CRH contributed handsomely to the political parties. One of my colleagues, former councillor David Healy, took out one share in CRH to entitle him to go along to the shareholders' meeting. He asked what parties CRH contributed to. He got the answer that it contributed to all the political parties. Why was there no intervention? Why were these people allowed to ride roughshod over everyone? The answer is that politicians stood by and let it happen. This is a terrible indictment and CRH is an example of why corporate donations should be banned. I agree with Deputy Owen that this is the time for a full investigation. Mr. Justice Moriarty said he will try to investigate the scandal of Glen Ding, but the Competition Authority needs resources to enable it examine the way CRH and others operated.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the role of the cement industry in the so-called progress of this country. There was an extremely interesting discussion in the House this afternoon involving the Taoiseach. It was one of the few times I have been captivated by what was going on in the Chamber. The discussion was about a quality of life index and Deputy Bruton and Deputy Quinn also made some interesting contributions. A large number of cranes on the sky line and much building activity is often considered a sign of progress. The national plan involves the building of more roads, more houses and better infrastructure. However, will that improve the quality of life in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the national plan has not proved a recipe for the improvement of quality of life. In terms of ecological sustainability, it is a retrograde step. It will increase enormously the amount of COf7&gt;2 that Ireland emits. The country does not have a hope of complying with the Kyoto Protocol under which it is allowed to increase emissions by 13% above the 1990 levels. If all the cement factories required because of the Celtic tiger economy and the national plan are built Ireland will not have the slightest chance of complying with the Kyoto Protocol. Cement production creates huge amounts of carbon dioxide <Col N="275" /> and local air pollution. Are there sufficient deterrents and do we have the capacity to clean up their mess?</P>
    <P>If one considers places where cement factories are located, one will see the terrible local pollution that is caused. The environment has, to a great extent, suffered in those areas and I have received many representations from people in that regard. Ringsend in my constituency is an environmental blackspot. The worst industry imaginable is located on the Poolbeg peninsula. There are two concrete crushing plants and when the wind blows in the direction of Sandymount, cars in the area are covered in a fine dust. People are breathing in this dust and there are huge problems in relation to asthma with one in four children in the area suffering from the condition as a consequence.</P>
    <P>There must be a role for the EPA. It has been slow to act and this is another example of the power of the people involved. Why has the EPA not come down heavily on companies such as CRH? This has not happened. Luckily, one of the concrete crushing plants in my area is being closed but it has been a slow process. It has taken much hard work from me and others. Regarding the Taoiseach's comments earlier, it is important to establish a quality of life index. It is fine to say that there will be huge investment in roads and houses and that this will make a tremendous difference to our standard of living. However, if our quality of life is reduced as a consequence, serious questions must be asked about whether we are taking the right direction.</P>
    <P>If there is increased concrete and cement production for the construction of roads, there will be more cars and more COf7&gt;2 will be produced. It will become an unsustainable cycle. Although the Taoiseach rejected my view, the Government cannot distinguish between standard of living and quality of life. If this continues, many people will become disenchanted with the Government. Health crises and housing problems are bad enough but serious questions must be asked if the environment is also suffering.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it repeals specific legislation. However, many questions arise in relation to CRH and I hope these questions will be asked in the future. The events we are witnessing at present at the tribunals are miniscule compared to the various stories of which we are aware about how people operated in shady ways. These people have had so much clout that they feel untouchable at present. However, the day will come when justice will be done. I hope when these matters are investigated that this white collar crime will not go unpunished and people will be put behind bars for terrible corruption over the years. When the investigations delve into the activities of a company such as CRH, I hope all the dirt will come out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The debate provides Members with an opportunity to discuss <Col N="276" /> a matter about which we are concerned. Many activities in the past of which we were aware are now coming into the open and it is good that Members have an opportunity to comment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to repeal the Cement Acts, 1933 and 1962. It will remove the requirement that any person proposing to manufacture cement may do so only in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In hindsight, the Cement Act, 1933, was extraordinary because it gave the Minister total control over who could manufacture cement and where and how it could be manufactured. However, we cannot judge the Act on the basis of the conditions that prevail at this time &ndash; it must be judged on the conditions that prevailed when it was introduced in 1933. At the time, it was excellent legislation which contributed to the development of the native cement industry. It achieved its objective in terms of ensuring there was an indigenous cement industry, capable of meeting the needs of the country.</P>
      <P>However, times have changed. It is obvious that the Act is now redundant and obsolete. It was introduced during a protectionist period when it was necessary for a small, closed economy such as Ireland to protect a native industry. Such protectionist policies are unnecessary in the current economic climate. I agree with other speakers that it is amazing the Act was not repealed before now. I hope its repeal will improve the conditions for further planned development and provide a fairer and more even playing pitch for those in the industry. I congratulate the Minister on examining existing legislation and taking the opportunity to repeal it when it is obvious that it is no longer relevant.</P>
      <P>I share Members' concerns about the success of the Act when it is clear that only one company obtained a licence for the manufacture of cement since the legislation was put in place in 1933. This correctly and justifiably raises many questions. It is incredible that no competitors ever received a licence throughout the years. We must ask why there were not more applications and whether the Act was overprotective. Did it produce a monopoly? My answer to those questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are different theories on why there was only one licensee. It may have been due to the high level of investment needed to stimulate an industry in the cement business. Overall, it was due to the unnecessarily protectionist element of the Act which gave a dominant position to one player &ndash; CRH.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that, in the contributions to the debates in the Seanad and the Dáil, much was said about the dominant position and many questioned the activities of CRH. All such questions are justified. Before asking any questions, I acknowledge that CRH was successful and provided good employment. Many towns and families are indebted to the role it played in their economies. However, in judging the success of any such company, we must also be realistic. We realise that it had no competition, that its road was an easy one to travel and <Col N="277" /> that it was a monopoly. It is disappointing and regrettable that, despite its monopoly position and the protection it was given, our native industry behaved very badly and to such an extent that the EU fined CRH £3 million for its uncompetitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some of the details and points made in a submission from the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance. Like Deputies Gormley and Owen, I congratulate the alliance on the excellence of its submission. I also found that the people who produced this document were sincere. One must accept that they have a valid point. They opened our eyes to many activities which appear to be ongoing in the cement industry. It is clear that no one else had a chance of entering the business when faced with the dominant position and industrial practices of CRH. This was unfair to those who wanted to make a living out of cement manufacturing. It was bad for our economy, for customers and for our competitive image.</P>
    <P>This document proves beyond doubt that many small players were forced to close because of the dominant position of CRH. It is regrettable that we, as politicians, especially those of us who had any period in Government, were not more observant of what was happening within the cement industry and that we did not realise that other potential cement manufacturers had no opportunity to develop and become part of this successful and profitable industry. Will the Minister of State examine thoroughly the points made in the submission? We should take great cognisance of them. They are made by people who tried to make a living out of this business but could not succeed because of the uncompetitive practices and dominant role of a major player.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be successful if it at least opens up doors and avenues to others who wish to make a living from cement manufacturing and also allows us to find out about CRH. It appears from the submission, and I accept the points made in it, that, irrespective of the title of some manufacturing industries, we do not know if they are subsidiaries of CRH or independent players. This document, which has been mentioned in the context of the introduction of the Bill in the House, merits thorough consideration on the part of the Minister of State. The repeal of the Cement Act, 1933, and the debate in the House will be worthwhile and fruitful if we end up with a climate where everyone, big or small, has an equal and fair chance of developing and benefiting from this industry and where the monopoly of CRH, which deprived others of making a success of what potentially could have been a successful business, is ended. This must be the outcome of the legislation.</P>
    <P>As well as being disappointed by the fact that the practices of CRH denied small players from developing, our questioning of its role in the economy is further merited by the activities of some of its directors. It is shameful that such a company, which was given such support by legis<Col N="278" /> lation and the political system, abused its position. I am sure everyone agrees that any such abuse and those responsible for it must face the full rigours of the law. They not only tarnished the image of CRH but also of Irish businesses. There is no excuse for this and their practices have been and are unforgivable. I hope they will be taken to task for it.</P>
    <P>With the repeal of the Act, which means no regulation or legislation exists in the area, we must question the current position. Whither the future of the cement industry? I hope the planning authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency will do a good job in the role they will play in any applications which come before them. It will be to the benefit of the industry and the people who may live close to a plant and it will ensure that all can live happily alongside each other if it is ensured that such plants operate according to the standards expected of them and that there is a healthy environment. The industry can flourish in a satisfactory and peaceful environment, irrespective of whether it is CRH or any other manufacturer.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as a result of this legislation, new investors will come forward with proposals to establish cement manufacturing plants in the State. I hope they will be successful. I look forward to the employment they will provide and to the huge benefits they will bring to the localities in which they will be situated. I also look forward to changes in the industry. We know the legislation being repealed was introduced in changing times. We now have a changed economy and changed circumstances. I acknowledge the important role the cement industry played in the economy over the years and its success. However, I also regret that so many people who could have benefited and who could have made successful and profitable businesses from the cement industry were isolated by the dominant position of CRH.</P>
    <P>When the economy is thriving and the building industry is expanding at a rate we never dreamed we would experience, it is important that we have a successful cement industry which is able to meet the demands and output expected of it. It is the one sector of the economy which provides so much employment at present. It provides numerous opportunities for apprentices and for many people who have tremendous manual and technical skills.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Gilmore. On Easter Monday I identified six issues <Col N="279" /> that must be addressed in the short term to reverse the loss of confidence in politics following the revelations of both tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The six issues I identified were a ban on corporate funding for politics, the introduction of tax clearance certificates for Oireachtas Members, legislation to provide for the registration of lobbyists, the early enactment of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, reform of the law on corruption and the introduction of a proper system of State funding for political parties and for politics.</P>
    <P>We have chosen, in our first available Private Members' slot in this session, to introduce the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill, 2000, because it goes to the heart of the problems identified in the hearings of various tribunals of inquiry &ndash; the corrosive financial relationship between big business and some parties in this House and between big business and a number of current and former Members of the House. However, I emphasise that we see this measure as just one part of the package of reforms I outlined earlier. The Labour Party wants to see all these measures enacted at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>That there has been a dramatic loss of public confidence is undoubted. Many of us are on record for many years as having warned of the corrosive and unhealthy atmosphere generated by our reliance on private and corporate funding because when it comes to fundraising, whether for charities, voluntary bodies, universities or political parties, those with the largest discretionary disposable incomes are inevitably targeted.</P>
    <P>In most cases it was normal for political donations to be made confidentially, which is no longer possible as a result of reforming measures such as the Ethics in Public Office Act and the 1997 Electoral Act, introduced, coincidentally, by Labour Party Ministers, lest their donations were interpreted as support for any particular party or candidate. No doubt some donors were genuinely motivated by a desire to support the political process in general terms.</P>
    <P>Private funding inevitably tends to favour larger, well established parties &ndash; the corporate sector, in particular, tends to favour the party it sees as the future senior partner in any coalition Government. This is not a case of me or my party waving our fingers at those on the other benches. For the record, I want to make it clear again that my party and its representatives have solicited and received donations from private sources. In the absence of a system of State funding, we will probably be forced to continue to do so. We do not believe every businessman or even every property developer is a crook, nor do we claim that every sum of money exceeding £999 must represent the proceeds of crime or that the only honest cheque is the wage cheque of a PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>However, this system of funding has always been undemocratic. It has now been brought to <Col N="280" /> such a level of disrepute that it can no longer continue, but in the absence of direct change, continue it will. In the Haughey era the suspicion grew that donations and possible wholesale corruption in public life were linked &ndash; that decisions of public bodies engaged in the public business were routinely bought and sold for private profit. Without proof we were unable to say so clearly. The extent to which these decisions have been dealt with simply as just another set of tradeable commodities to be brokered for private gain has shocked us all.</P>
    <P>Apart from the current shocking disclosures at the Flood tribunal, we have previously learnt how a serving Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, was the recipient of funding from rich individuals and the corporate sector amounting to millions of pounds. We have also learned how a long serving Member of this House, Ray Burke, chosen by the current Taoiseach as recently as three years ago to fill the key position of Minister for Foreign Affairs, raised more than £118,000 in advance of the 1989 general election, at a time when most candidates would have spent considerably less than one tenth of that figure on an election campaign.</P>
    <P>There seems no doubt either that some members of Dublin County Council sought and received bribes in return for favourable votes on crucial rezoning issues and that these people should and must be called to account. Those who sold their votes must be driven out of politics. Those who broke the law must face the consequences and should be shown no mercy.</P>
    <P>However, I accept that many of those who received money from Mr. Dunlop were receiving what they believed were, in their own definition, &ldquo;normal political contributions&rdquo; and that no favours were granted in return for the money. They may have shown very poor political judgment in accepting donations from a man who played such a crucial role in securing support for controversial rezonings and would have been far better off had they, like Deputy Rabbitte, said: &ldquo;Thank you, but no thanks&rdquo; and sent the money back. It is extraordinary that Deputy Rabbitte, the one individual who was offered money by Mr. Dunlop and returned it, has been singled out for such attack over the past week.</P>
    <P>However, given what we now know from the report of the McCracken tribunal and from the hearings before the Moriarty and Flood tribunals, it is incumbent on the political parties to attempt a restoration of some degree of confidence in the integrity and impartiality of public administration in this State. We should also set ourselves a deadline for action which is realistic and achievable. By the time the Dáil rises for the summer, all the crucial decisions about what we need to do will have had to be taken and tomorrow night's vote will be one of them. I have been happy to discuss the issues with the Government and other Opposition parties, but the Labour Party will not be party to any drawn out process, designed solely to delay the implementation of necessary measures. <Col N="281" /> The last time that happened, Fianna Fáil used the time to raise over £2 million to clear its debts.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposals set out in this Bill, the Labour Party makes no apology for tackling first of all the party funding issue and, in particular, the corrosive and destructive effect on the political process of its reliance on private sources to fund its activities. The Public Offices Commission recently stated that we have one of the finest electoral governance systems in Europe. Perhaps it is too early to make a judgment on that, as the Electoral Act, for instance, has never fully applied in a general election, but we have been happy to base this Bill on the firm foundation of that Act.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's track record on these issues is clear. As far back as 1991 we introduced a Private Member's Bill to provide for disclosure of the interests of public representatives and of donations to political parties. The Bill was rejected out of hand by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government as &ldquo;obnoxious&rdquo; and probably unconstitutional. We were accused of generating unfounded fears and of seeking to legislate for issues that simply did not arise in 1991. Notwithstanding tribunal revelations, I suspect the same arguments will surface again over the coming months.</P>
    <P>Constitutionality has arisen at each and every stage of the campaign to clean up politics and has been raised as an obstacle at every stage of the reform process. The Government's statement of yesterday evening states that there are constitutional issues involved, but that is a statement of the obvious. There are always constitutional issues involved in any legislative proposals. Constitutional concerns have informed the drafting of this Bill and we believe it to be sensitive to the delicate balance between competing rights that is necessary in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I attended a meeting with the Taoiseach and other party leaders. I accept that there was genuine concern on behalf of the leaders of the parties about the difficulties the political process is now in, but I was struck by the absence of any real concrete proposals from Fianna Fáil to deal with the issues. I regard the decision by the Government not to support the Bill as an act of bad faith. It is simply not good enough to defer for a further six months decisions in principle on issues such as corporate funding.</P>
    <P>In the course of recent weeks the Taoiseach made an argument which he can scarcely take seriously himself let alone expect others to do so. He claimed that corporate donations should be retained because their abolition would disadvantage poorer politicians. In other words, according to the Taoiseach's analysis, reliance on individual donations would benefit those who moved in circles where individuals had money to spare. However, companies which apparently by definition have more than enough money to spare are in a position to bestow their bounty indiscriminately for the benefit of rich and poor alike. Of course this is complete nonsense. There can be no doubt that corporate donations go dispro<Col N="282" /> portionately to parties already well established within the political system, particularly to those established in Government. By their very nature such donations are skewed. I put it to the Taoiseach that he does not want to do away with corporate donations because it is on such donations that his party's political hegemony is built.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support of the Fine Gael Party for the Bill on Second Stage, notwithstanding its reservations. There seems to be a genuine misunderstanding between us on one issue. We are not arguing that corporate donations alone should be banned so that, for example, a firm of accountants or solicitors could give money to a party but an incorporated firm of engineers could not. Our Bill does not mention companies or corporations. What we propose is that registered electors could use their own resources, not their trading income, to make a donation to their party in the same way as they support their parish, football club or residents' association.</P>
    <P>While I welcome Fine Gael support, I do not accept the argument it has advanced that no distinction can be made between corporate and individual funding. Individual citizens are the subject matter of politics. Citizens have the right to form parties, support them, canvass for them and run as their candidates. I do not believe it is either right, proper or necessary, to try to break that link between a party and its members and supporters. Individuals are political personages, corporations are not. Individuals can have strong political convictions, corporations rarely do. Individuals have socio-economic and political rights, corporations in effect do not.</P>
    <P>Whether it is fair, the public perception is that the relationship between business and politics has become poisonous. That in itself should be sufficient for it to end. A ban would be good for politics and it would also be good for business. Nevertheless, I understand the concern expressed by the Green Party, a long time opponent of corporate funding, that provision for individual donations will allow people circumvent the ban on corporate donations. The Bill represents our best thinking on the issues involved and I am happy to hear the views of others who accept the principles that underlie it.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about our efforts to comply with the constitutional obligations of fairness. Individual citizens have rights and one of them is to participate in the political process. It is precisely for this reason that we did not set the cap on individual donations even lower in the Bill. A system solely financed out of the public purse would suit the established parties well if that was to become the case. It would, however, be fundamentally unfair to newcomers to elections &ndash; individuals or parties &ndash; if they were barred from raising their own campaign funds while at the same time, for want of any track record, they were ineligible to receive public funds other than the existing recoupment. We need to find an appropriate balance here and I am open to hearing the views of others on how precisely that could be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Recoupment of election expenses after the event goes some way to meeting the needs of independent candidates and smaller parties. The proportion of expenses which can be recouped this way should be increased, but a rule that the only money which could be spent on elections would be by way of a State grant would serve only to benefit the parties currently entitled to such money to the exclusion of all others.</P>
    <P>Our party's position is that nothing less is required than a complete break between party expenditure and corporate funding. For constitutional reasons and so as not to disadvantage non-party candidates, we do not propose to ban donations made from the after tax income of private individuals. As the law stands, for example, even the £5 membership sub paid by members of the Labour Party constitutes an individual donation. Our proposal is that a party or a candidate should not be permitted to receive any donation except from a registered elector. In other words, both corporate and overseas donations would be absolutely prohibited.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste stated recently that the banning of corporate funding is an issue she is prepared to consider. However, when it comes to backing up those fine words with actions, she has again been found wanting. Again the Attorney General appears to be holding sway. Some people in the Progressive Democrats have argued that the party could not have got off the ground were it not for financial assistance from the corporate sector. I would point to the history of the foundation of that party as promulgated by itself. Within its first year its founders, for whom I have genuine regard, addressed capacity audiences at conference halls, theatres, hotels and leisure centres throughout the State. It very quickly became the fastest growing political movement in the State. It had in that early stage all the characteristics of a mass political movement. Yet the lease on its first headquarters was secured on foot of personal guarantees entered into by its trustees, including the current Attorney General. There is no room in this version of the story, which has some factual basis, for the theory that the Progressive Democrats would not have survived its first year without help from corporate godfathers. Certainly, the new mass membership which it was seeking to attract to a new form of politics was never informed of such a fact.</P>
    <P>This version of history also ignores the reality that the Progressive Democrats was at that stage seeking to compete with established parties with even better access to the boardrooms of Ireland than it had. In other words, it was seeking to join a game played according to pre-determined rules, rules that go further to prevent the entry into politics of any new political force than anything proposed this evening.</P>
    <P>As regards overseas donations, there simply would be no point in reforming the donations system at home if the continued distortion in the political process caused by overseas fundraising <Col N="284" /> continued. The UK has banned such donations and we should follow suit. My party has benefited in the past from contributions made by socialist and social democratic parties in other parts of Europe. We and other parties should forego contributions from abroad in preference for strengthening the links between parties and citizens active in the State. As in the equivalent British legislation, special arrangements would have to be made in respect of parties registered in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Overall, the purposes of our Bill are to restrict the making of political donations to registered electors; to reduce the threshold above which disclosure of donations must be made from the existing limits of £4,000 to a party and £500 to an individual, down to £1,000 and £250 respectively; to limit the amount which may be so donated &ndash; £2,000 to a party, including all its candidates, and £1,000 to an individual; to limit to £2,000 the amount that can be paid to a political party by way of membership fee by an affiliated organisation; to remove the existing prohibition on the spending by political parties of public money at elections; and to provide for an annual statutory audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of public moneys paid to political parties.</P>
    <P>As regards the Labour Party and its structural links with the trade union movement, which appear to be news to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, we propose that where the constitution of a political party provides for independent unincorporated organisations of individuals to be members of that party, an annual membership fee may be lawfully paid. However, that membership fee, as is the case at the moment, would be classified as a donation and would, therefore, be capped at £2,000 regardless of the number of members of the affiliated organisation. No further financial assistance in cash or in kind would be permissible above the annual £2,000 membership fee.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear from the outset that in proposing these measures I start from an underlying position to which I am absolutely committed. I believe in the political process and in party politics. Political parties have a function which is essential as well as honourable. A democracy cannot function without properly incorporated political parties. They are the means by which people fulfil their roles as citizens, organise themselves to participate in public life, promote and implement social, economic and cultural goals and decide upon questions of national policy. They serve the common good. Any laws to regulate and control the funding of political parties in the public interest should recognise this proposition as a basic starting point.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason I have always called for public funding of political parties not just to remove the temptations inherent in a system of unregulated private funding, but because the party political process, as a vital component of the wider democratic process, in its own right, is worthy of recognition, respect and support. I <Col N="285" /> recall writing a piece for the<i> Sunday Tribune</i> in the late 1980s on this subject.</P>
    <P>We have not included in this package any proposal to increase the amount provided by way of State payments to political parties. It is clear that such an increase is required in the context of the ban on corporate donations and the cap on the size of donations from individuals which I propose. However, that <i>quid pro quo</i> for my proposals is one which, for constitutional reasons, can come only from the Government. Opposition parties, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle as you would clearly indicate to us, cannot introduce Bills which involve a limited increase in Exchequer funding. It is acceptable to increase the existing Exchequer subvention as a substitute for funds from private sources. While considerable State funding exists, the system compels parties to raise private funds by debarring them from using those public moneys at election time. The parties, however, receive a refund of approximately one third of expenditure from the Exchequer for candidates who receive a quarter of a quota at an election.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend this set of proposals is exhaustive, amounts to the last word in this area or is incapable of improvement. However, reform along these lines is urgently required. The House must be seen to be capable of reacting swiftly, firmly and coherently to the present crisis in public confidence if we are to retain any entitlement to call ourselves public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Government's response has been disappointing. It seems designed to muddy the waters. It is important that the thrust of these measures be accepted in principle by the House. The details can be worked on. For example, the idea that the Attorney General should be charged with beginning afresh on the lobbyists Bill is a nonsense. Such a Bill will be introduced during this session and the Taoiseach can accept it or vote it down. The manner in which the Government is reacting to this legislation is entirely consistent with the opposition that Fianna Fáil mounted to virtually every Bill aimed at institutional reform pioneered by the Labour Party, including the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and the Electoral Act, 1997. When we were in Government with Fianna Fail, it sought to delay or water them down. When Fianna Fáil was on this side of the House, its opposition was more direct. The themes were those we hear again now &ndash; unconstitutional, over-regulation, unfair to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I referred to the first reforming Bill we introduced in this area in 1991, the Ethics in Public Office Bill. I hope that Fianna Fáil Members will read some of the comments they made on that modest legislation and that they will cringe with embarrassment. The current Attorney General and then Progressive Democrats Party spokesperson, Michael McDowell, described the Electoral Bill, 1997, as a &ldquo;theoretical, ideological statist Bill, designed to stop political parties from being independent of the State&rdquo;. Such intemper<Col N="286" /> ate and ludicrous but deeply felt comments do not inspire confidence in the willingness of this Administration to deliver the sort of institutional reform that the political system needs if it is to survive and recover the confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>The public is once again looking to this House for action but it is getting inaction. The premise underlying the Government's proposal is that these issues are new and require further consideration. The reality is different. This debate has been part and parcel of political life for the best part of a generation. It figured prominently, for instance, in the 1989 general election campaign. It is an issue that Deputy Fleming has obviously considered at length from the vantage point of one personally involved as the financial controller of the Fianna Fáil Party in Mount Street prior to his election to the House in 1997.</P>
    <P>How typical of this Government and this Taoiseach that they are not ready yet to rise to the challenge. No doubt its amendment will give it six months grace, but it will be six months in which the reputation of politics suffers further. Make no mistake, the Labour Party will not be party to any proposals that do not ban the corporate funding of politics. We need to move with haste on the principles underlining this legislation and work together on the details to make sure we get the best legislation possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Sooner or later this Labour Party proposal to ban corporate donations to political parties and politicians will become law and this House will pass the legislation proposed by the party. It will do so because the tide has already turned on the corporate funding of politics, and because already, even in Fianna Fáil, which opposes the measure, Members such as Deputy Fleming and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, have spotted the change. Even the Government amendment acknowledges that the House must pass legislation and the Government is postponing the evil day.</P>
      <P>The sooner the House passes this legislation the better for politics. This Bill, which the Labour Party signalled as far back as its annual conference more than a year ago, is being debated against the bleak backdrop of property interests corrupting public decision making by bribing the votes and decisions of elected and appointed public servants. Even if there was no suggestion of corruption, the time to break the financial link between business and politics is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to what some commentators would have us believe, the corporate funding of political parties and political campaigns is not the third secret of Fatima. It has been well known that some companies were paying political contributions to parties and individual campaigns over a long period and until recently these were generally regarded, as Mr. Justice Hamilton famously put it in the beef tribunal report, as &ldquo;normal political donations&rdquo;. The practice should be ended because the corporate funding of the political <Col N="287" /> process has, at the very least, distorted political competition.</P>
    <P>Until the enactment of the Electoral Bill, 1997, which was introduced in the Oireachtas by Deputy Howlin, there was no limit to what a party or a candidate could spend in an election campaign. While the level of election spending and votes received did not positively correlate in each case, it is clear that the parties with the greatest financial resources got the highest number of seats in elections.</P>
    <P>It was always difficult, and sometimes impossible, for a candidate or party with limited resources to compete with the expensive advertising and professional campaigning of the larger party, with its corporate funded war chest. A candidate or a party might have a worthy message or set of policies at election time, but how were they expected to communicate them effectively to the electorate during the three weeks of an election campaign? Money enabled candidates and parties to talk at election time and those whose messages were heard best were those who could afford the costs of communicating. The corporate funding of political parties significantly influenced the outcome of elections and the formation of Governments.</P>
    <P>If the first distortion of politics caused by corporate funding related to elections, the second relates to policy and ideology. It is not an accident that the parties which have received and still receive the overwhelming bulk of corporate funding are those which are generally perceived to be pro-business. In a way, the corporate funding of the more conservative parties in this State has been itself the justification for trade union funding &ndash; limited though it is &ndash; of the Labour Party. As a former trade union official, I recall debates at union conferences about the establishment and existence of a political fund. Put very simply, the argument was that if employers were going to promote their collective economic interests by funding political parties, workers also needed to have a political arm to which the trade unions contributed.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that this country is unique in Europe in that we have never had a Labour-led Government and that traditionally the Labour Party and its allies on the left have been the third force in Irish politics, behind Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. This aspect of the country's political history is not unrelated to the fact that the Labour Party has always had to contest elections against uneven odds and never had the same financial resources for organisation or electioneering as the two larger parties. Neither is it an accident that the dominant ideological consensus has been that whatever was good for business was good for the country.</P>
    <P>The third distortion of politics to which corporate funding has contributed is the decline in public confidence in our democracy, and it is the most worrying. What began as a tangible declaration of class allegiance, or perhaps a sense of duty to <Col N="288" /> fund politics generally, has, it appears, in some cases, degenerated into a straight corrupt trading of votes for money. To restore confidence in politics we need to end the corporate funding of political parties. The days of corporate funding of political parties are probably numbered anyway. Huge and welcome changes are beginning to overtake the traditional relationship between citizens and the representatives they elect to local authorities and to parliament. Information and communication are the oxygen and life-blood of politics.</P>
    <P>Up to now, communication between the politician and the citizen has been mediated through the mass media and advertising. The communication of political messages has become an expensive business requiring political parties and politicians to compete not only with each other but also with the whole consumer array available to the public. Policies, serious political discussion, and the exchange and debate of ideas must give way to the sound-bite, the advertised image and the spin. Marketing has become the centre of political activity and it is expensive. To date it has been paid for in the main by contributions from the corporate sector. The signs are, however, that it is changing. New information and communication technology makes it possible for the citizen and the public representative to communicate with each other directly without the need for expensive advertising. That, coupled with the limits that have already been placed on election spending, will reduce the need for big campaigning war chests.</P>
    <P>That is not to say money will not be required by political parties &ndash; of course it will, to fund research, develop policies and staff the new kind of communication cycle. The Labour Party believes this should now be done primarily through funding from the State. If we value our democracy we must fund it from public funds and in a way that is open and accountable. We also have to ensure that the individual citizen retains the right to contribute to political causes, including political parties. That in itself is a fundamental aspect of the right to organise.</P>
    <P>The Bill confines the right to contribute to political parties to those who are entitled to register to vote. It, therefore, excludes corporate funding. It also excludes funding from outside the State. This is an important aspect of the Bill. How and by whom we are governed is a matter for the voters of the country and nobody else. That is what we call self-determination. There have been well documented stories of some political parties and single-issue campaigns seeking and raising significant sums of money, in the United States for example, for the purpose of influencing politics in this State. That should no longer be permitted. Lobbies of what ever kind in the United States or in any other country, have no right to buy political influence in this State either by funding political parties, individual candidates or single-issue campaigns. The Bill would prohibit that activity for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I wish to refer to the proposed Government amendment. Like so much that we get from Fianna Fáil, the amendment is for everything, against nothing and proposes to do nothing about either. The amendment proposes to postpone consideration of Second Stage of the Bill until 1 December this year, which incidentally is a Friday and, therefore, not a sitting day. That is not the only evidence of Fianna Fáil's cynicism in this amendment, however. If what is being proposed in the legislation is not being opposed directly by the Government then why is it being postponed?</P>

      <P>It would be better for politics, for the Government and for Fianna Fáil if it was to accept Second Stage this evening rather than postponing it until December. We should not put off until then what needs to be done now. Whatever consideration may be given in future to the detail of the Bill, it can be done by agreeing Second Stage and referring it to a committee. What discussion and amendment has to be done can be undertaken at that stage. I appeal to Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Independents to accept the Bill. Incidentally, as this issue is not one that can bring about an election, there is no obligation on Independent Members to support the Government's position when the vote is taken tomorrow evening. I appeal to them to support this measure on Second Stage. It aims to ban corporate contributions to political parties, to put a new limit on declarations and on the amount that can be contributed by individuals, and to ban the funding of politics from sources outside the State.</P>

    <P>&ndash;noting the proposal to appoint an expert group in consultation with the party leaders to assist and advise that committee. The terms of reference will require it to report back to the party leaders not later than 30 September 2000, so that all necessary legislative changes can be introduced and considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas not later than 31 December 2000,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>&ndash;with a view to facilitating a fully considered constitutionally valid and comprehensive legislative response to public concerns about corruption in the political process and public administration,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> postpones the Second Reading of the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill, 2000, until 1 December 2000&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this Bill is motivated by the current climate of revelations in relation to contributions and payments to politicians. Make no mistake about it, the recent revelations of corruption are intensely damaging to every politician, irrespective of whether they ever took a contribution, legitimate or otherwise. As for the general public, the revelations have sickened people of all ages and across the political divide.</P>
    <P>Against that background, it is incumbent on me, as the opening contributor from this side of the House, to begin by reiterating the clear position of the Government. Our message is short and simple. It is unambiguous and unequivocal. Corruption or wrongdoing have no place in public life. It is immaterial whether it is an office-holder, a TD, a Senator, a councillor or an official that is involved. Corruption is anathema to the whole concept of public service. Those engaged in corrupt practices are not public servants; they are self-servants. Their actions give legitimacy to the old question, <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes </i>&ndash; who will guard the guards?</P>
    <P>In looking at the problem of corruption eating away at the foundations of trust throughout the political system, there is a real danger that we will choose a solution that is simple, straightforward and wrong. What we must achieve &ndash; and I agree with the Labour Party on this &ndash; is an urgent solution but we must also achieve a right solution. It is a combination of these two objectives which is behind the comprehensive amendment I have moved on behalf of the Government. The amendment has two main features. First, it sets out the agenda which will ensure that all of the complex issues involved can be considered in a comprehensive manner through an all-party framework and supported by an expert advisory group. Second, it sets down a timetable for the completion of the committee's work which is as ambitious as the urgency of the situation demands.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the Government has decided that the all-party committee and the expert advisory panel will be provided with whatever assistance they require by officials of my Department and the Departments of Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are familiar with the full range of issues involved in the eight legislative measures referred to in the amendment. My colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will also contribute to this debate and will deal with the issues of standards in public office and prevention of corruption in more detail. Given that my responsibility is for the electoral code, I want to focus on the issue of funding the political system.</P>
    <P>Despite what might be said here by the Labour Party, the funding of the political system is a complex matter. The Labour Party Members found <Col N="293" /> that out for themselves when they were in Government trying to get the Electoral Bill of 1997 through the Houses. Not all of the delay that occurred in the passage of that Bill was caused by a robust Committee Stage&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still robust &ndash; in private, not in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in which Deputy Howlin, myself and the then Deputy Michael McDowell participated. Several issues had to be teased out and the then Minister found that there were constitutional issues that he could not quite overcome. This is not a simple matter. It is complex and we must consider this issue&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bad effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a bad effort; I think we made a great job of it in the circumstances. We must consider this issue in today's legal framework and not in the framework which existed when the nefarious deeds which are emerging from the Flood tribunal took place. The Labour Party can take credit for the fact that we are talking about deeds that took place ten years ago but we are now in a different situation in terms of our political system.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the regulatory context in which we operate today is substantially different from that of a few years ago. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, the Electoral Act, 1997, and the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, provide a radically improved backdrop to the conduct of public affairs. There is now a transparent regime for disclosure which applies to political parties, Oireachtas Members, MEPs and councillors.</P>
      <P>As regards the disclosure of donations provisions of the Electoral Act, 1997, I am not aware of any major problems with their implementation, although I know certain parties had some difficulty in complying with the provisions. The matter was raised with them by the Public Offices Commission, and it was not Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>If it were the case that the current legislative provisions in the Electoral Act, 1997, were shown to be deficient in some major respect, there may be an argument for change. The reality, however, is that the current system of disclosure is working well and we are committed to building on that system with the local government Bill, which introduces comprehensive ethics provisions &ndash; based on disclosure &ndash; for local councillors and officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality that disclosure works has been overlooked as people become focused on the issue of whether the time has come for a fundamental shift in policy involving the introduction of a ban on corporate donations. On the face of it, a ban on corporate donations with compensatory public funding for political parties is a simple solution but there are fundamental issues surrounding the concept of a ban on donations. The first one is a definition of &ldquo;corporate&rdquo;. Does it include <Col N="294" /> partnerships, sole traders, business associations? Do we ban donations from all businessmen and women? Who will believe us if company A is banned from giving a donation but the six directors of such a company are allowed to give so-called personal donations?</P>
    <P>There is another problem. The Bill applies to donations to candidates for elections, etc. It does not apply to donations to persons who are not candidates at the time of the donation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are major legal, practical and financial implications for the operation of the political process which have to be taken into account in any meaningful consideration of the options. For instance, what about the rights of freedom of expression enshrined in the Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill were to be enacted, what steps would be needed to ensure the political parties could control their local branches, officials and individual members without establishing large bureaucracies to watch over every penny a member of the party may receive? That is a major problem. It may not be much of a problem for some of the smaller parties, including the Labour Party&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the argument we heard in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it is a major problem for the larger parties and has posed problems in implementing the 1997 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clear that when we are talking about funding the political system with a complete ban on donations we are talking not just about funding the political parties as they are in this House but funding political parties at constituency level also, if we are to go down that route. Perhaps that is the route we will take but we have to debate these matters and they have to be teased out.</P>
      <P>How much public money will the measure cost? In the current climate, would taxpayers be happy to see their taxes funding political parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is right. It will make life much easier for most of us who spend a lot of time raising funds for parties. We have a leadership role to play in this matter. In the current climate taxpayers are more likely to say that they have found out that politicians in the past were corrupt, and they are now making <Col N="295" /> us pay the cost to keep them honest. Most people will know the reaction of the public to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>How could we ensure that the funds would be distributed in an equitable manner? How would the proposals affect the growth of existing and new political parties? Even the Labour Party has recognised that this could be a problem. What implications would the proposal hold for policy development, and would it leave political parties at a disadvantage in comparison to the sophisticated, high powered lobbying interests that are out there?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In a ban environment, there is a risk that we will witness an increase in the phenomenon of third party expenditure by corporate interests in support of certain political beliefs. At the end of the day, is it likely the public will see any difference between a donation to a party or an individual person from a prominent business person who is registered as an elector, and a similar donation from the company of which the same person is the principal? These are all legitimate questions which need to be discussed at the committee we are setting up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the questions are addressed properly and fully and that we do not have a knee-jerk reaction to a situation which is obviously very serious. It is, therefore, clear that any moves to restrict or ban private contributions to political parties require careful consideration. The issues involved are central to the workings of the political system and democracy. The amendment I moved is based on the Government's firm belief that the issues involved should be given the urgent and full consideration they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what we ultimately need in the corpus of our legislation. We do not need a band aid for one particular cut in the body politic but rather a comprehensive and aspirational approach which does not just say, &ldquo;You will not do this and you will not do that&rdquo; but which articulates for all time the standards we require of our politicians at the beginning of the 21st century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that the Government, despite what the Labour Party is saying, is not opposing this Bill. We are simply seeking to postpone its Second Reading until 1 December, by which time we can achieve, as far as possible, a well thought out consensus on the issues before us &ndash; careful consideration of serious issues. Ultimately this will be a good day's work for the Oireachtas. No party has exclusive rights to honesty and no party has exclusive rights to the solution of our problems. Therefore, the wisdom of all parties should be brought to bear on this matter so that we will achieve not only an urgent outcome but also a correct and lasting one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn referred to Fianna Fáil clearing its party debt and that we delayed the passage of the Electoral Act in 1997 to give us a chance to clear it.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is not opposing the principle of this Bill. We want to deal with this matter in its proper context and achieve, if possible, all-party consensus on these important issues. This is why <Col N="297" /> I moved the amendment to the motion and I request the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent 21 years in local government and my family has been associated with it since 1914 &ndash; this experience can be transposed to the other political parties &ndash; and I am appalled at the revelations emanating from the tribunal, as are the majority of those involved in politics, from every political party. We all want a resolution so this will not happen again. We also want those who are found guilty and have admitted wrongdoing expelled not only from Fianna Fáil but from the political system because they have done serious injury to the body politic.</P>
      <P>Nobody involved in politics can defend or condone what has happened and the involvement of some people. Therefore, there is an onus on us all to ensure appropriate legislation is passed. This legislation needs to be far-reaching and must ensure these circumstances do not arise again. It is essential that the valid points made by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the leadership of my party are fully debated and some form of consensus reached so that the best legislation can be drafted and passed by this House. Tonight's approach will not reach any conclusion in this regard.</P>
      <P>We need to stand back from what is happening and begin to understand that the headlines in the paper and the media discussions are about our country. Sometimes it is hard to believe they are discussing Irish politics, which is, regrettably, the case. I am new to this House and I want to see the best outcome. The delay of Second Stage is the course of action upon which we should embark. During the time that allows us, we should ensure that we listen to the views of all political organisations, all those involved in politics and those interested in ensuring we have best political practice. Legislation should be introduced as quickly as possible after that. As a new Member, I want to contribute to that debate. The introduction of this Bill now does not give me the opportunity to deal in detail with the issues which confront us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that this problem and its resolution are complex. There is another factor in this equation &ndash; it is not only politicians who are before the tribunals. Some officials have come before them and admitted serious wrongdoing, perhaps more serious than that admitted by politicians. There must be audits of every political party, which are being conducted, as I understand from comments made by leaders of the parties. There should also be an audit of local government throughout the State because, given what has been said at the tribunals, this could have happened in any county. We need to look at the structures of all local authorities and identify if there was wrongdoing outside Dublin and <Col N="298" /> if so, the people involved must be brought to book and the appropriate sanctions applied to them, be they officials or public representatives. That must happen because we need to repair the body politic.</P>
      <P>The appropriate sanctions must be agreed. We may expel someone from a political party, from this House or the Seanad or we may ask people to resign their local government seats. We must also put in place the appropriate sanctions for officials. The whole system must be examined. The framework for that examination and those sanctions needs to be debated.</P>
      <P>These events may have taken place ten years ago but we are dealing with the fall-out now. We are dealing with a situation which may still be continuing in some quarters. We need to find a resolution to this problem. I want to see this issue being debated, the best legislation being brought forward and confidence in politics in this State restored. This will only happen if we step back from this, examine the issue, debate it and then introduce the legislation.</P>

These revelations do them a great disservice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an assumption that this issue was only raised by one party. That is not quite so. Deputy Alan Shatter raised this matter in the House on several occasions. In 1989, when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government was in power, he demanded an inquiry into planning scandals in Dublin County Council. Deputy Shatter was accompanied in that demand by Deputies Gay Mitchell, Eamon Gilmore and Ruairí Quinn. It is important to reflect on the answer they received and who was entrusted by the Govern<Col N="300" /> ment with the giving of the answer. On 9 November 1989 the words uttered were, &ldquo;The Government has no plans to set up a judicial inquiry&rdquo;. Who spoke on behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on that occasion, saying that the Government &ndash; so I presume the matter was discussed at Cabinet &ndash; had no plans to set up an inquiry and refusing a demand for an inquiry? It was none other than former Deputy Raphael P. Burke, the then Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>When the matter was raised subsequently in the House who, as Minister for the Environment of the day, also refused to set up an inquiry into planning in Dublin County Council? It was none other than former Deputy Pádraig Flynn. These were the two people who refused an inquiry when one was demanded by Deputies Shatter, Gay Mitchell, Gilmore and Quinn. The Ministers were supported in their refusal by the entire Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government at the time. As Ray Burke said, the Government had no plans to set up an inquiry, therefore, the matter was clearly considered by the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been letting us know some of the intimate secrets of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition and his discussions in a Cabinet committee with the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, and Deputy Howlin. Perhaps he might find out what was discussed at Cabinet in 1989 and 1990 when Ray Burke was empowered to say that the Government had no plans for an inquiry.</P>

      <P>Is that not a matter of real importance?</P>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the passage of Second Stage of the Bill, as presented by the Labour Party. While we have some reservations about elements of the Bill we wish to see it succeed tomorrow. The Bill needs radical change but we would like to see the details teased out on Committee Stage. Let the House and its committee system be seen to do the job of changing this Bill.</P>
      <P>Recent allegations call for a comprehensive renewal of Irish politics &ndash; putting public service back where it belongs as the touchstone of political action. Legal measures alone, such as this Bill, will not be enough to achieve what is needed. What is also needed is a moral renewal in Irish politics, reaching back to the standards set by those who founded Irish political democracy in the 1920s and 1930s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every citizen has a responsibility for the political system. No one can retreat to his private world, as many may now be tempted to do, detached from politics, regarding it with uninvolved cynicism as they sip their Chianti in the back garden, regarding those who are involved in politics as beneath mention. In a democracy, everyone is a politician. Young people, in particular, have a responsibility to involve themselves in politics. The more incomes outside politics rise, the greater the financial cost of involvement in <Col N="301" /> political life. That does not lessen the responsibility that rests on the best people of their generation to become involved in political life and to seek elected office. Young people must see politics as a vocation, above all as a calling to serve the public interest that makes it different from any job whose main purpose is the making of a living. Unless matters change, few young people will see Irish politics in that light, the light in which it must be seen if democracy is to be preserved. The aim of the measures which the Dáil must agree in the coming weeks must be that of making political life one to which the rising generation of young people will aspire.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely and worthwhile. Fine Gael would, however, go further than the Labour Party. Donations to political parties by wealthy individuals, unincorporated businesses, groups lobbying for particular interests or causes, professional partnerships, for example, solicitors, accountants and architects, are no different from corporate donations and should hardly be treated differently from them in legislation. If the limits for individuals and companies are set at different levels, companies who want to evade these limits will do so by giving funds to directors to enable them to make donations in an individual capacity. A donation by a private landowner &ndash; seeking rezoning, perhaps &ndash; is no different from a donation by a building company seeking to build on the land. Why should the limit placed on one donation be different from another? More discussion is required on the distinction being drawn between corporate and other donations in the Bill. That discussion can take place in committee. That is why we should pass the Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>If, as a result of an overall ban on private funding of parties, total Exchequer funding was to be provided then no donations at all would be allowed. If, on the other hand, some fundraising is to remain  &ndash; and Fine Gael believes it should &ndash; then it must be controlled, carefully measured and accounted for. All donations, however small but subject to the difficulties of administrative convenience, should be disclosed. People should have nothing to hide in supporting democracy because in doing so they are supporting one of the highest callings. Donations above a limit should be banned, whether they come from companies, partnerships, or individuals.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that any Bill addressing this issue must, in addition, deal with three further matters. First, there must be a regulation of the benefits a party might derive from the links with other organisations which may provide them with political leverage, cross-subsidies or benefits in cash or kind. It should not be possible to evade the limits on cash donations by getting benefits in kind from an associated organisation.</P>
    <P>Second, we must deal with the sourcing of donations or funding from individuals and companies based outside Ireland, as Deputy Gilmore has said. It would make no sense to have tight limits on local donations and none on foreign <Col N="302" /> ones. Foreign donors are not accountable to Irish law, even when they have economic interests in Ireland and there is no way of finding out whether their motives are corrupt or otherwise. There must either be a ban on foreign donations or an effective means of applying the same controls to donations from outside the jurisdiction &ndash; and not necessarily overseas &ndash; as apply to local donations. Unless donations are under the control of the Oireachtas they should be banned.</P>
    <P>Third, we must deal with the issue of the funding of groups which campaign against parties or individual candidates. These would have to be limited in the same way. If candidates are cash limited, there must be a limit on the funding of those trying to unseat candidates. This is not an academic issue. In a local election, a group campaigning against a dump might decide it wants to unseat a particular councillor. It would not be fair if he was limited in what he could spend and the group was not. A pro-life organisation might compile a list of six Deputies it wanted to defeat in an election. Should it be unlimited in the amount it could spend while the Deputies defending themselves could not raise or spend money? Clearly, that would not be fair. That is an issue that has to be dealt with in legislation of this nature.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act defining the work and duties of the Public Offices Commission should be amended to allow it receive and publish from all parties the donations they receive from all sources above a certain very low limit. If there is to be an overall limit &ndash; let us take the figure of £3,000 proposed by Fine Gael, one can argue about the figure, I do not want to get bogged down about whether it should be £500 or £3,000 &ndash; we would be concerned that a particular individual in a particular county who wants to gain influence would make donations of £3,000 to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and all the Independent candidates that he could think of&mdash;</P>

Clearly, it is necessary to control the amount an individual donor might give as well as the amount a party or individual candidate might receive. Both issues have to be dealt with if there is to be equity in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On past occasions the House has shown that it can take action quickly. In government with my colleagues in the Labour Party and Democratic Left we faced a great crisis, but with the support of the Opposition, Fianna Fáil, we put through at great speed a great amount of legislation to deal with crime, some of which was proposed from these benches by Fianna Fáil. While there is no comparison between murder and the crisis we are facing &ndash; a life has not been lost, however great the scandal has been &ndash; it is a good example on <Col N="303" /> which the Minister should reflect. The then Government which I was proud to lead was willing to accept Fianna Fáil Bills to help us deal with the crime crisis. We were also willing to introduce our own legislation and dealt with it as an emergency, but there is no sense of emergency tonight.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not willing to accept the Labour Party Bill as a vehicle for change. Although he knew it went to the heart of the problem, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently rejected a Fine Gael Bill on corruption proposed by Deputy Flanagan. He was not willing to amend it. That small-minded attitude &ndash; if the ideas come from this side of the House, ignore them &ndash; remains.</P>
      <P>As the ultimate expression of democratic governance in this State, it is very important that the House shows it can act, as a House, decisively on this issue, not in committees meeting in rooms where lawyers intimidate politicians, as happened not that long ago when people tried to parade their knowledge in order, almost, to silence the ultimate elected voice. It is very important that the politicians, the people elected to Dáil Éireann, take charge of this issue. We have the mandate, no one else has. Officials, Attorneys General, constitutional advisers, disputatious lawyers, the media, spin doctors and commentators do not have the ultimate responsibility, we do. We have got to show in our reaction tonight that we are taking charge of this issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister who is both a reformer and radical thinker &ndash; he has produced much legislation which bears witness to this &ndash; reconsider the position his party is taking and accept and use the Bill as a vehicle for change? He may find in a month's time that he has to substitute another Bill for it because it is flawed in some fundamental way, but let us find that out, as politicians, rather than shove it away in a committee where the public will have no sense that the politicians are in charge and will think that all the Government is doing is creating some turgid machine to generate an umbrella under which it can hide from all the manure that may fall from the tribunals on its head.</P>

      <P>This is not a pleasant time to be in politics. The scale of what has been revealed in the past few weeks and the further revelations yet to come demand a searching analysis of the practice of politics and a willingness to be radical in our approach to reform of the system. As practising politicians we must accept the reality of what has been revealed, deal effectively with the situation and put in place a programme of reform to prevent further abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality of what has been exposed is dismal. A former Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil is <Col N="304" /> exposed as having been a kept man for much of his political life. His close supporters during the 1980s, including the Taoiseach, are under a cloud of allegation and rumour. Did those close to Mr. Haughey allow their conscience to be silenced by their ambition? As well as the disgrace visited upon the former Taoiseach in recent years, two senior Government Ministers were forced to resign because of financial irregularities. Allegations of the most serious nature have been made against present and past Members of the House. It is evident that the worm of corruption has buried deep into local government in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>As the tribunals of investigation continue their hearings, we are likely to hear new revelations which will further undermine the political system. These tribunals of investigation established by and responsible to the Dáil, not by the Taoiseach or Fianna Fáil, are part of the necessary cleansing of the political system.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work of the tribunals, each political party has an obligation to deal with allegations of corruption within its own ranks in a thorough manner. The Taoiseach, as the leader of Fianna Fáil, the largest party in the Dáil and the major party in government, has a particular responsibility in this regard. We are entitled as Members of the House to ask how effective the Taoiseach has been in dealing with allegations of corruption within Fianna Fáil. How thorough have the investigations been to date? Has he managed to cleanse the major party in government of the taint of corruption? Are we still climbing trees in north Dublin? We await the report of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle with some interest.</P>

      <P>I accept that it is coincidental that you are here but I hope you are listening because, as a Member of the House, I am entitled to put the question. The ability or unwillingness to deal effectively with corruption within his party gives rise to the most serious doubts about the capacity of the Taoiseach and the Government to lead a programme of reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased public funding to political parties must be part of a reformed political system. A legislative framework for political parties must also be part of the new dispensation. As regards public funding of political parties, the current annual subvention to parties is little more than a couple of million pounds. Let us compare this figure with the cost of the tribunals of inquiry in recent years &ndash; McCracken, Hamilton, Moriarty, Flood &ndash; which would be enough to finance the political parties under regulated terms for at least a quarter of a century. A reformed political system, even if it resulted in significantly increased public funding of political parties, would be a very small price to pay for a system free from recurring scandals. It would prevent the need for <Col N="305" /> future costly public inquiries and would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Our responsibilities, as legislators, are clear-cut. We are both members and guardians of the political system. The case for reform is overwhelming. There is no argument in favour of waiting, as we have been told by Fianna Fáil. Our obligation to the electorate and ourselves is to hastily pursue a programme of political reform with energy, conviction and speed.</P>

      <P>It was brought to my attention that a small farmer in north County Meath applied for REPS in 1996 and a review took place three years later in 1999. Following inspection, a 10% penalty was imposed on the landowner for failing to trim back a hedgerow, as stated in his plan submitted in 1996.</P>
      <P>The farmer appealed the decision to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his appeal was supported by the ICMSA and by the IFA. Having considered the matter, the members of the committee upheld the decision on the basis of the plan submitted by the farmer. The matter was further appealed. The first appeals officer upheld the decision on 1 April. That decision was appealed on 4 May 1999 and the committee upheld the decision. This matter was passed to a further inspector on 27 October, who carried out an inspection of the lands in question. His report stated that the hedgerow is a back double ditch with a great deal of thorn bushes growing on it as well as various mature trees such as ash, hazel, birch and sycamore. The relevant plan and the original plan stated that this hedgerow was to be breasted in year three of the REPS plan, but this decision is questionable. The hedgerow was bare on the day of inspection, but I am sure that in summer it provides good necessary shelter for the animals on this very high ground. The ground, although on the top of a hill, is very wet and heavy and evidence of machinery damage is still apparent more than one year later. There was clear evidence of hand-cutting of this hedgerow by the farmer.</P>
      <P>The recommendation of the inspector was that it would have been contrary to environmentally friendly farming to machine this hedgerow at the expense of the soil in the adjoining field. Thus, the correct decision was taken by the farmer to discontinue this work. However, the farmer had made attempts to cut this hedgerow by hand and the hedge is in a very healthy condition generally. The inspector recommended that the penalty of 10% be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the point in an inspector reviewing a decision taken by original inspectors and recommending a change if the Department officials do <Col N="306" /> not implement that change? The farmer in question has a small farm in north County Meath. He suffered serious damage and loss last year as a result of the fodder crisis. The Minister of State might have visited that farm or the area close to it. The Minister of State, who has responsibility for this scheme, should make a blanket decision on the basis of decisions made by inspectors. If they recommend the original decision be changed, they should be the final arbiter on the matter. There were three inspections of this matter, the original appeal, one by the committee and another inspector was asked to carry out an inspection to make a decision on this matter. This is not the only such case, I have heard of many others. The Department should give a direction that in the event of a decision not being upheld on appeal, payment should be made immediately.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Deputy, as I was notified to reply to a different matter on the Adjournment, a matter raised by Deputy Bradford.</P>
      <P>I accept there is a problem regarding the matter raised by Deputy Farrelly, but the views in regard to it are subjective. The Deputy did not mention the fertiliser aspect, but the requirement in this respect has been obeyed by farmers generally. Hedgerows are particularly important. That is more evident in farms where the hedgerows have been cut and the birds no longer land or nest there.</P>
      <P>Inspectors generally do not object unless a hedgerow has been desecrated. Farmers can trim the sides of a hedgerow, but not top it. That is to enable the ash, mountain ash and other trees grow. There is nothing wrong with a farmer trimming the side of a hedgerow. I agree with the Deputy that individuals can differ on how hedgerows should be trimmed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the imposition of a penalty of 10% in respect of the farmer in question. That is not bad considering penalties of 50% and 100%, with which I do not agree, have been imposed. There may be a case for an independent body considering appeals in this area. The payments in this respect are mainly European money and perhaps matters such as this should be decided by an independent body. The Department officials who make decisions on an application also decide on the appeals in respect of them. I am not saying there is anything wrong with their views on that matter. They have strong views, but perhaps an independent body should interpret appeals in respect of such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great take up of REPS. A total of 43,000 farmers participate in it and we want that number to increase to 60,000 in the next 12 months. As farmers increasingly engage in part-time farming, we want more of them to participate in the scheme. I accept some of them are frightened to participate in it because of the penalties imposed at times. There have been some blatant abuses of the scheme where ditches have <Col N="307" /> been removed and ponds and lakelands filled with top soil and clay. In cases of such blatant abuses of the scheme, detailed inspections of farms are required. My farm was inspected three times in respect of REPS since I became Minister of State and it passed those inspections. I have been told that is a computer fact, but I am beginning to doubt it.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in that people have different views on this matter. We may need to address it in a different way. The imposition of a 10% penalty is not that bad, but I object to the imposition of penalties of 50% and 100%.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>: </b>The story of David and Goliath is alive and well and has been re-enacted of late in Carlow. The Irish Society for Autism was made aware in October-November 1999 that a property, Ionad Folláin, in Myshall, County Carlow was for sale. It expressed an interest and in January-February 2000 members of the board of directors visited Ionad Folláin, stayed there to check it out properly and concluded that, subject to price, the property was suitable for developing as a centre for people with autism. The expected purchase price was in the region of £650,000 to £700,000. Before making a definite offer the society negotiated a loan of £400,000 from a building society and the remainder was to be raised in other ways from the society's resources.</P>
      <P>Ionad Folláin is an 18th century Glebe house surrounded by six acres of mature gardens. It has substantial out buildings which provide accommodation for up to 30 people in single and twin-bedded rooms. Clearly it was ideal as a home for persons suffering from autism. Imagine the shock which the Irish Society for Autism got when it discovered that the Office of Public Works moved in, paid over £300,000 above the price it had been negotiating and purchased the building to house refugees. Why did the price jump by £300,000? Why did nobody ever mention that a voluntary body was raising funds to purchase the building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Society for Autism took the initiative to set up a treatment centre because of the absence of proper activity by the Department of Health and Children in the provision of facilities for treating autism. The village of Myshall would have gained employment for about 30 people. Instead the Department of Justice, Equality and <Col N="308" /> Law Reform is talking about housing refugees in an area where there is no public transport, no source of employment and none of the facilities normally found in towns and cities. Even at this late stage I ask the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to step back from out-bidding a voluntary body. If the contract is signed I ask the Department to hand over the building to the Irish Society for Autism who cannot compete with a Department flush with money.</P>
    <P>The Irish Society for Autism was not aware of the Office of Public Works's interest in purchasing the property until it read about it in the newspaper. Immediately afterwards the owners contacted the Irish Society for Autism to ascertain if it still had an interest in acquiring the property. I quote the answer, &ldquo;We were and still are but we are unable to match the purchase price&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish Society for Autism is not in a position to become involved in negotiating with each health board individually on the need for services for children and adults with autism. The need is there. Health boards must become proactive in the development of specialised provisions for people with autism. The alternative is misplacement and possible life-long institutional care. This is unacceptable in the Ireland of today. It is unacceptable that a Department would gazump a voluntary body. The Department must have known because the owners contacted the Irish autism group to ask if it was still interested. Given that a bid was taking place, it is unbelievable that anyone would ask if anybody was interested in the property. This property was on sale since October-November 1999. It is unacceptable that the Department outbid a voluntary body which was raising funds to acquire the property.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal specifically with the matter raised by the Deputy concerning the property in Myshall. The Deputy raised many other issues. I shall set out in brief detail the chronology of events in relation to this matter so as to give some necessary background to this entire issue. I dealt with this matter in recent parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>The property in Myshall was initially offered to my Department by the proprietors following the advertisement which was run in the national media earlier this year seeking suitable accommodation for asylum seekers. An architectural inspection of the property was undertaken, as is normal. The report arising from this inspection was favourable. The directorate for asylum support services, after inspecting the property, instructed my office to pursue the acquisition of Ionad Folláin for use as an accommodation centre for asylum seekers. The Myshall property is capable of accommodating up to 40 people immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the issue of the Irish Society for Autism and the inference that in some fashion the Office of Public Works deprived it of the property. The Irish Society for Autism did not <Col N="309" /> advise the Office of Public Works directly at any time of its interest in the property prior to the conclusion of the sale negotiations. It would have been difficult, therefore, for the Office of Public Works to have wilfully taken a decision to take the property from the society. We did not know anything about it from the Irish Society for Autism. I am putting the facts on the record.</P>

I suggest if the Irish Society for Autism has any difficulty it may be in its negotiations with the proprietors, but it is certainly not with the Office of Public Works for the reasons outlined. My office treated the proprietors of the property generally on the basis of the valuation which they had been advised was appropriate by their professional valuation team. It was not my office that put the valuation on the property but rather the proprietor. There can be no question, therefore, that my officials used their position to artificially inflate the price beyond what any party competing for the property could pay. I am advised that the capital cost of this property compares favourably with the cost of developing similar accommodation elsewhere. Those are the facts of this case so far as my office is concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the driver testing service of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I thank the Minister for coming in to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from this report that a complete overhaul of the driver testing service is necessary. Recommendations jump off the pages of this report. The recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General is a damming indictment of a service which was found to be haphazard and inefficient. It showed that the pass rate for drivers varied from as low as 47% in Gorey to as high as 71% in Sligo. Centres in the three eastern regions tended to have pass rates below the national average. The question arises as to why there are such variations. Yet again we are relying on the good offices of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, to highlight another flagrant inefficiency in a basic service to the consumer and citizens. Was the Government happy to drive on regardless of the glaring inconsistencies in the level of testing throughout the country? Was the <Col N="310" /> Department aware of this situation and, if so, why has so little been done until the issue was brought into the public domain in this way?</P>
    <P>It is clear there is a difference in the standards demanded from different testers and some routes are far more challenging than others. Drivers who pay a variety of road taxes are entitled to better treatment on this issue. At a time when the number of cars coming onto our roads is increasing at the level of 1,000 per week in the greater Dublin area alone, it is clear that drastic action is needed to increase the number of testers and to ensure they operate to a uniform standard. The number of people driving on provisional licences, many of whom would want to take the test at an earlier stage, is a cause of major concern, particularly in light of the increasing number of deaths and serious accidents on the roads and the numbers of young people involved in those accidents.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the waiting times and I hope the Minister will address that issue tonight. The new target is a ten-week waiting period. Are these targets being met in the Dublin area and in other areas? The Minister has announced an independent review of the service, but will he outline more immediate action to tackle the problem which has major safety implications for drivers, passengers and all road users? The immediate steps would include the provision of more testers to reduce the backlog of tests, regular and mandatory refresher courses for testers and a review of all the testing routes to ensure uniformity of standards. Surely some of these issues could be tackled immediately. What is the timescale for the independent review report and when does he expect to get it? I welcome the fact that the Minister has said in the context of that report that there will be broad consultation. There are a number of areas where the initiative could be taken immediately to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>An independent review could be translated as putting the issue on the back burner. It is a most urgent issue which demands immediate action. The report is an indictment of our approach to this central issue for road safety at a time when there are increasing numbers of new drivers on the roads. In this case, safety considerations demand a swift and efficient response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to inform the House of the Government's response to the value for money report on the driver testing service prepared by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report identifies three main areas where change is needed to improve the service. These are uniformity in the standard of the driving test; waiting times and supply of driving tests; and the cost of providing the service. Some of the report's recommendations can be addressed within the existing organisational structure. However, it does not address in detail the broader issue of the <Col N="311" /> lack of responsiveness of the service in a rapidly rising market.</P>
    <P>The report also referred to the difficulties arising due to the inability of the service to respond quickly to a rapidly changing market. Paragraph 4.34 of the report states that the Department:</P>
    <P>. . . had insufficient flexibility in responding to the need for changes in staffing levels because of problems in reaching agreement with the staff representative association and because of difficulties in the civil service recruitment procedures.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations, while valuable, do not purport to address the fundamental issue of the lack of responsiveness of the service to the market.</P>
    <P>Fair and challenging questions have been raised in the report about the operation of the driver testing service. In the interests of our customers, I intend that these will now be addressed squarely and comprehensively. I have announced that my Department will immediately put in hand a review by consultants of the organisation and delivery of the driver testing service, with particular reference to the requirements of responsiveness and flexibility in an expanding market. The review will include full consultation with service users, staff and other interests and I intend that it will be completed as a matter of urgency and necessary changes put in place.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to inform the House of the current position regarding the delivery of the driving test service. The Department has increased its tester corps from 66 to 101, giving a current capacity to carry out 200,000 tests per year. This increase in testing capacity is already producing much needed improvements in the service. The average national longest waiting time has reduced from a high of 41 weeks to 29 weeks in April 2000. The waiting list has shortened by more than 11,000. However, indications are that the volume of applications received to date in 2000 point to a record 170,000 applications compared to the previous record of 153,389 applications received last year.</P>
    <P>My Department proposes to meet this unprecedented demand by the employment of additional testers, including retired, contract and permanent testers. While the rapidly rising demand may cause difficulties, due to the inherently inflexible nature of the driver testing service to which I referred, I am determined to maintain and build on the improvements that have already been made.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to provide a testing service which is responsive to customer needs. I assure the Deputy that I and my Department are committed to taking the measures necessary to ensure that a quality service is provided and I look forward to the outcome of the consultants' review of the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In less than a month, representatives of the Government and NGOs will attend an important UN conference on women in New York. This conference will provide governments with an opportunity to review their activities in implementing the commitments to which they signed up during the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Ireland's record on progressing the Beijing declaration and platform for action has been poor. We signed up to 12 clear promises in Beijing, but all the evidence suggests that we have made little headway on progressing them.</P>
      <P>In January the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform produced a national report on the implementation of the Beijing platform for action. While the report presents a range of measures which are ongoing since the Beijing conference, many of them are not new and others are merely pilot programmes. Ultimately, the report is an attempt to put a good face on the failure of the Government to make progress on the Beijing promises. Since then, the role and status of Irish women has, in some instances, disimproved.</P>
      <P>One of the other crucial promises to which the Government signed up was the alleviation of poverty among women. It also promised to promote greater economic independence. Since taking office, there has been almost no movement on some of the most crucial income inequalities which still face women. In the last budget, the Government decided to introduce controversial individualisation of the tax code. In doing so, it decided that the poorest women in society, who are treated as dependants in the social welfare code, could wait for their right to an individual payment.</P>
      <P>Women living in poverty are often the managers of poverty in their households. They take responsibility for stretching an inadequate budget to meet the needs of children and of running the household, often by sacrificing their own needs. This role which women play in disadvantaged households is not reflected in the social welfare code. Women are still not treated as individual adults. In the context of our commitments made in Beijing, this must change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, since the Beijing conference, it has emerged through research carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency that many older women are seriously at risk from living in poverty. Again, this arises because of their treatment in the social welfare code. When it comes to the administration of pensions, this results in them getting a reduced payment either through the qualified adult rate or a non-contributory pension. As a result of the marriage bar, women were forced to leave their jobs until the 1970s. Many of these women are now reaching pension age and discovering that, because they did accumulate sufficient stamps during their working lives, they do not qualify for a contributory pension. To date, these women are still paying for the blatant <Col N="313" /> inequalities which were accepted in society until recent decades.</P>
    <P>The Beijing promises contain other important commitments which are being pushed to the bottom of the priority list. The Beijing promises seek the elimination of the violation of the rights of the girl child. The current lack of appropriate treatment places for girls with behavioural problems flies in the face of this promise. There have been many cases in the courts recently in relation to that issue. The growing number of young girls who, because of a lack of structures in society to deal with their needs, are sleeping on the streets at night also flies in the face of the promise.</P>
    <P>By signing up to the Beijing platform for action, we signed up to a commitment to advance women at the heart of all Government policy. However, when the Government took office almost three years ago, its first act to undermine women was the merger of the Department of Equality and Law Reform with the Department of Justice. The post of second secretary in that Department remains vacant, underlining the virtual consumption of the Department of Equality and Law Reform by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>From there on, equality became virtually a non-issue for the Government. During its first year in office, it managed to reduce the number of women representatives on State boards instead of increasing it. Now women's representation on such bodies has significantly fallen to the extent that even women chairpersons of some boards have been replaced by men.</P>
    <P>We have progressed little since Beijing. An honest audit of our efforts on the Beijing promises at the New York conference will show that we have yet to really begin the work of executing our commitments to which we signed up five years ago in Beijing. A debate in the House before the New York conference would be useful to consider the various issues and promises which were made in Beijing. It is crucial to produce an action plan on the Beijing promises and make a real difference to the status, role and position of women in Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the 12 critical areas of concern of the Beijing Platform for Action. As regards an audit of progress in those areas, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform prepared a national report in 1999 setting out progress in each of the 12 areas. This national report was in response to a UN questionnaire to governments on the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and was submitted to the UN in January this year. The report was widely circulated and is available on the website of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A previous progress report was published in December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Beijing Platform for Action was agreed by the representatives of 189 countries attending the conference. The Platform for Action identified 12 <Col N="314" /> critical areas of concern considered to represent the main obstacles to women's advancement. It defined strategic objectives and actions to be taken by governments, the international community, non-governmental organisations and the private sector to overcome these obstacles. The objectives and actions are framed in a way that they can apply globally.</P>
    <P>The starting point and ongoing development of gender equality are different throughout the world. The actions agreed at Beijing are being assimilated into Government policy in a manner appropriate to Irish conditions. Substantial progress has been made in implementing the Platform for Action in Ireland, and I will mention some of the actions undertaken or under way in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>One of the overall aims of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is that all spending under it should support the achievement of equal opportunities between men and women. In accordance with its commitments, a gender perspective will be incorporated across the six operational programmes of the plan. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been assigned a lead role in overseeing the implementation of these equal opportunities commitments. It has funding for positive action in the national development plan, and one of the areas which will receive attention is women in decision-making, including politics.</P>
    <P>At a national level, wide-ranging equality legislation has been introduced. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, came into force in October last year. An equality infrastructure comprising the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations supports the implementation of this legislation. On 26 April the President signed into law the Equal Status Bill, 1999, which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 April 2000. This Act will provide protection against discrimination outside the field of employment for the first time in Ireland. It prohibits discrimination on the same nine grounds as the employment legislation. The Equal Status Act, 2000, is a ground-breaking measure that has the potential to positively affect many areas of life. We can also now lift one of our reservations to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been allocated £250 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the development of the child care infrastructure in Ireland over the next seven years. This investment is unprecedented and demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing the child care issue. Structures are being established at national and local levels to ensure that the development of a child care infrastructure takes place within a co-ordinated approach which includes all relevant players.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, violence against women <Col N="315" /> remains a problem. As part of the Government response, a national steering committee on violence against women, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was established and is working on the development of a national response to the issue. Legislative provisions to combat domestic violence have been put in place over the past number of years to improve the protection of victims of violence. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is examining a number of proposals to amend the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, to extend the coverage of the Act.</P>
    <P>Two significant developments in the area of human rights which are relevant in the current context are the establishment of a human rights commission and the preparation of legislation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. Both these matters have their origins in the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be undertaking a review of the overall structures for the monitoring and implementation of current commitments with respect to gender equality as agreed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and relevant research has already been commissioned. While much progress has been made, it is agreed that there is still some way to go to achieve full gender equality in society. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has started work on the development of a national action plan for gender equality for 2000-05. Consultation with NGOs will be an important part of the work of developing the action plan. The enhancement of consultation structures was a theme of the recent national forum for non-governmental organisations in Dublin Castle on 10 May.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 May 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I favour the promotion and development of renewable, sustainable and alternative forms of energy which can play a key role in meeting our commitments on greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. The Commission for Electricity Regulation has published a discussion paper on green issues dealing with a number of matters and has invited comments for its consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the questions raised by the commission in the paper is whether it is appropriate to set a level on the maximum total capacity of green generation that should be connected to the transmission system in Ireland. The commission has indicated that it would welcome proposals for <Col N="318" /> suitable strategies for accommodating large levels of green generation on the system while ensuring the security and quality of supply to the levels required by customers.</P>
    <P>My policy in relation to the generation of renewables is well established. Renewable energy technologies are promoted through a number of mechanisms. The main such mechanism is the alternative energy requirement. Already some 80 MW of electricity generated from renewable resources is in place and a number of renewable energy projects supported by the AER are expected to come on stream before the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have set out in my Green Paper on Sustainable Energy an increased target of 500MWe of additional renewable energy based electricity generating plant to be procured in the period 2000-05. The new target will be met, in the main, by means of recurring competitions under the AER programme and direct sales to final customers as provided for in section 14(1)(c) of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>I have established a renewable energy strategy group to examine all obstacles to the deployment of renewable energy technologies. The group's initial report, which will concentrate on obstacles to the increased deployment of wind energy technologies, is due for completion in the middle of the year. Among the issues that the group will examine will be the capacity of the electricity network to accommodate electricity generated from wind energy. I remind Deputies that this discussion paper on green issues published by the commissioner is a consultation document only. My Department will be communicating its views to the commission in the context of the consultation process. I am sure that the commissioner will take account of any comments received during this process.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by disabled and other mobility impaired people in using public transport. It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them.</P>
      <P>As already announced in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, all new and upgraded rail and bus stations financed under the plan will be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; all light rail vehicles and suburban railcars financed under the plan will also be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; all buses purchased by CIE from 2000 for use on urban services will be low floor.</P>

      <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of this contract have been raised with the EU Commission by an interested third party. I understand that the Commission has not yet completed its examination of the arguments advanced by the complainant and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It would, under the circumstances, be entirely inappropriate for me at this stage to speculate about the outcome of the Commission's deliberations on this matter. Likewise, it would be inappropriate for me to enter into conjecture about the action, if any, which may be necessary once the Commission informs Ireland of its conclusions in this matter. However, my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has indicated that he is confident this matter can be satisfactorily resolved. The Government is committed to the retention and development of the post office network. I have recently asked An Post to allocate £5 million specifically to the upgrading of the rural sub-post office network. The possibility of some matching funding from the Exchequer for this purpose will also be examined. In this context, An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union are currently considering options for the sustainable development of the rural sub-post office network under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Phil Flynn. I am confident these negotiations will result in measures which will ensure the future of the rural network.</P>

      <P>IRMS identified 44 unreasonable risks in its review of railway safety in Ireland carried out in 1998. In the implementation review published last March, IRMS identified a further 11 unreasonable risks. Officials from my Department, IRMS and Iarnród Éireann have been in discussions regarding the progress of Iarnród Éireann in resolving these risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the original 44 risks identified in 1998, 32 have been resolved. The remaining unreasonable risks were the subject of priority work during 1999. In the course of this priority work it was found that the target dates for completion which were included in Iarnród Éireann's railway safety programme were clearly over ambitious. These risks are continuing to get priority attention and the company is in the process of drawing up a <Col N="322" /> more realistic timetable for the completion of the work. I should point out that because of the particular nature of these risks they require a longer timeframe to address.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that a number of the 11 new unreasonable risks identified in the recent implementation review have already been resolved and the company is in the process of dealing with the remainder. I expect to receive full details of the work planned together with revised timetables for all remaining risks within the next few days.</P>

      <P>My Department and the RPII had received a preliminary report from the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, concerning an incident at the Wylfa nuclear power plant which resulted in the closure last month of the two magnox reactors at the plant.</P>
      <P>The RPII has since been maintaining contact with the NII in relation to this matter. The position is that reactor number two was shut down in early April for its planned biennial maintenance outage. During a routine television inspection of the reactor core, some unusual marks were detected on the sides of some of the channels therein. The channels, I understand, are not used for fuel or control rods. Since reactor number one has similar features, it was decided to shut down this reactor also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the RPII that inspections by Wylfa personnel on reactor number one are still in progress and that both reactors remain shut <Col N="323" /> down. The RPII is continuing to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>Any incidents involving the old magnox reactors, such as the two reactors at Wylfa, are a matter of serious concern. This is the second occasion this year when both reactors at Wylfa have been shut down. We have consistently expressed concern to the UK authorities about the continued operation of the old magnox reactors beyond their original design life. We have urged them to close these reactors and we will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to sell any equity in the airline to any anchor stakeholder prior to the initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>A consortium involving Salomon Smith Barney and AIB capital markets has been appointed as the joint global co-ordinators and underwriters for the Aer Lingus IPO.</P>
      <P>The likely scale of proceeds from the transaction is ultimately dependent on a number of considerations including the company's business plan, sentiment on international capital markets and, in particular, ratings given to international airline stocks generally. This will become clear nearer the date of the offering.</P>

      <P>I am aware of difficulties that the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has been experiencing in relation to enforcing the law concerning pirate radio stations. I intend to address the legislative difficulties being experienced by the ODTR under proposals to reform the existing Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926-1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> As part of these proposals, I will introduce explicit powers which will enable prompt and effective action by the regulator against unlicensed pirate radio operators.</P>
    <P>The current legislation allows the ODTR to bring a summary prosecution, which can result in a maximum fine of £1,000 or three months in jail. A prosecution on indictment which carries more severe penalties and which can result in the forfeiture of the equipment is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. These penalties will need to be revised and the use of statutory injunctions in respect of offences will also be examined.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding these difficulties in the current legislation, in the last few months the director's office has closed three stations in Dublin and one in County Monaghan and a number of other investigations are ongoing. Advertisers on pirate stations are being monitored and ODTR staff on the road are monitoring interference issues. A large number of pirates in the Dublin area have also been identified and located.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether Ireland is facing an unprecedented energy and environmental crisis with energy imports costing more than £1 billion per year and an energy dependency reaching unprecedented levels with imports now accounting for 86% of Irish energy supply and rising; and the plans, if any, in place to deal with this situation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13342/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to energy supply is not as dramatic as the question implies. The key objectives of energy policy are to ensure environmentally sustainable energy production and consumption, develop a competitive energy supply industry, ensure security and reliability of energy supply and maximise energy efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy suggests, the Irish energy market is characterised by increasing demand, scarce indigenous sources of energy, a high dependence on imports for our energy supply and limited interconnection. Unprecedented economic growth has resulted in increased energy demand over the past number of years and this trend is expected to continue. A key element of Irish energy policy, in that context, is the need to ensure security of energy supply. At the same <Col N="325" /> time environmental concerns and the imperative to meet international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol impact on energy policy.</P>
    <P>Strategies that are being followed in relation to Irish energy objectives include the diversification of fuel sources in electricity generation, the maximisation of energy efficiency through Irish energy centre programmes, and the promotion of additional electricity generating capacity from renewable sources.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation of electricity markets is expected to result in a significant increase in gas as a proportion of the fuel mix in electricity generation. Gas is projected to increase from 30% of the fuel mix in 1998 to 56% in 2010. As the Kinsale field reaches the end of its productive life, the new find at the Corrib field, yet to be declared commercial, takes on more importance. As the Deputy may be aware, the results of appraisal tests carried out to date in the field have been very encouraging.</P>
    <P>The recent decision to replace older peat fired generating plants with two new peat stations, along with the peat plant under construction at Edenderry, will ensure a continued indigenous input to the electricity generation fuel mix.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, both I, as Minister, and the Commission for Electricity Regulation in carrying out our duties under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, must have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the need to promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. We also have a duty to take account of the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>In relation to energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy, the Deputy will be aware that my Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, published last September, establishes a new framework for the promotion of energy efficiency and the development of significant renewable energy electricity generation which are central to energy policy in the context of the Kyoto commitments. Programmes and measures tailored to all energy consuming sectors are set out with the objective of reducing levels of energy consumption below the business as usual forecast. A new target of 500 MWe of electricity generated from renewable sources of energy has been set. The Government, in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, has provided for expenditure, to a total of £146 million, on activities and programmes related to reduction in energy consumption and the further deployment of renewable energy sources.</P>

      <P>I should state, as has previously been acknowledged by the Deputy concerned, that requesting advice and assistance from a State agency in relation to external correspondence is not in itself unusual. It is the tone and content of the alleged advice and the extent to which it may have been heeded that is objectionable.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Taoiseach, I wrote to Ms Helen Liddell, MP, the British Minister of State for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe on the following day in the matter.

I asked Minister Liddell to let me have her Government's response to the allegations.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting Minister Liddell's reply. However, I should add that the Taoiseach raised this issue with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, at their meeting in Dublin on 18 April last and is now in correspondence with the Prime Minister on the matter.</P>

      <Quest> the programme, if any, she will undertake in 2001 in respect of the introduction of the euro to protect consumers from companies which round up prices, as occurred during the introduction of decimalisation. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an EU legal framework for the use of the euro. The directly applicable EU law relating to the core of the Deputy's question is Council Regulation (EC) No. 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 which lays down rules for conver<Col N="357" /> sion between national currencies and the euro, including rounding rules. Article 4 of that regulation expressly provides that conversion rates shall be adopted with six significant figures and that the conversion rates shall not be rounded or truncated when making conversions.</P>
      <P>In addition to these legal requirements, the right of consumers not to be overcharged for goods and services further is being safeguarded through ensuring that businesses sign up to either the national code of practice on dual display of prices, which I launched on 9 June 1999, or to business organisations' own codes, provided that those codes have been approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Subscribers to the national code and to approved codes commit themselves to carrying out the changeover fairly and to seeking no advantage from the conversion. To date, the director has approved codes for IBEC, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association and the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland (Irish branch).</P>
      <P>Subscribers to either the national code or to approved codes will be entitled to display a logo. Display of the logo will inform consumers that the subscribers in question have agreed to undertake the commitments under the national code or approved codes, and the logo will include a contact point for use by consumers in any case where they consider that the commitments are not being adhered to.</P>
      <P>Awareness of and familiarisation with the euro will help consumers to be vigilant. This is one of the key objectives of the European Consumer Centre, ECC, O'Connell Street, Dublin, which is co-funded by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the European Commission. In June 1999, the ECC published a free guide, entitled Consumer's Guide. The guide aims to raise awareness among the public of some of the practical aspects of the changeover affecting consumers, including buying goods and services, payment of social welfare benefits, wages, banking services, pensions, insurance and travel. The guide was distributed nationwide through, for example, consumer information centres and money advice bureaux. As the first run, 15,000 copies, has been exhausted, the guide has now been reprinted. In addition, the ECC recently published a shorter guide to the euro which is also free of charge and which is aimed at helping older consumers in particular to become familiar with the new currency. This information leaflet features some typical grocery items with prices in euro as well as in Irish pounds, and it sets out the EU rules to which I have referred for carrying out conversions between Irish pounds and the euro.</P>
      <P>Both publications are available, too, on the ECC's website, the address of which is: www.ecic.ie</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the euro section of the ECC's website has now been adapted, with assistance from the National Coun<Col N="358" /> cil for the Blind of Ireland, to be fully accessible to the blind and visually impaired.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 87 to 90, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The job initiative programme, JI, is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The programme is available to persons 35 years of age or older who are in receipt of either unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or one parent family payment. The fundamental objective of JI is to progress participants into mainstream employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of JI was carried out during 1999 by Deloitte &amp; Touche, consultants, who made a number of recommendations regarding the future operation of the programme. Some of these recommendations have already been implemented including: an extension of six months for the first phase of participants who have completed their term on the programme to address any further training or development needs they may have; direct entitlement to the following secondary benefits has been extended to JI participants: rent supplement, mortgage interest supplement, local authority mortgage <Col N="359" /> interest supplement, fuel allowance, back to school clothing and footwear allowance, Christmas bonus and the medical card; and JI participants now have an entitlement to the back to work allowance when they progress to employment in the open labour market.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations are the subject of consultations with the social partners represented on the standing committee on the labour market. My Department intends to pursue separately the matter of JI participants living in local authority accommodation with the Department of Environment and Local Government with a view to considering the appropriateness of having JI income disregarded for the purposes of differential rent assessment.</P>
    <P>The process of consultations with the social partners is now nearing completion. It is not my intention to delay the consultation process longer than necessary as I am aware of the urgent need for clarification for sponsors and participants involved with the programme.</P>

      <P>The strategic plan for the forestry sector in Ireland, set an annual target of 20% for broadleaf planting. This target has been met on average over the past four years. This compares with annual broadleaf planting of 2% to 3% in the mid 1980s. Grants and premiums under the afforestation scheme are and will continue to be heavily biased in favour of broadleaf planting.</P>
      <P>The emphasis now is on increasing the diversity of species planted to enhance the environment and broaden downstream timber processing activities and protect forest health.</P>
      <P>Quality of land is crucial in dictating the opportunity for diversity of species. Many broadleaf species are very demanding of land quality while conifer species are more productive on poorer type soils. Land becoming available for planting in County Kerry does not, as a rule, lend itself to broadleaf planting.</P>
      <P>The number of acres of broadleaf planted nationally in 1999 was approximately 5,000 acres, while the number of acres planted in Kerry was 153 acres. These figures do not include broadleaf trees planted as part of conifer plantations and broadleaf trees planted near rivers, roads and scenic areas, which amount to an additional 4% approximately of all grant-aided planting.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that the establishment of a new International Criminal Court must await ratification of the Rome Statute by 60 signatories, he will indicate when Ireland will ratify the Rome Statute; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13429/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 96 states have signed the statute and, of these, nine have ratified the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Accordingly, considerable resources were made available to ensure that Ireland was represented at and participated in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the statute. Ireland continues to be represented at the preparatory commission set up after the Rome conference to deal with matters necessary for the <Col N="364" /> effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force.</P>
    <P>Ireland was anxious to sign the statute at an early date to signal our strong political support for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
    <P>With regard to Ireland's ratification of the statute, I am arranging for the drafting of a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution to enable the State to ratify the statute. Aside from the need to amend the Constitution, a careful and detailed examination of the statute by my Department, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary to determine the precise nature and scope of the legislative and administrative measures which may need to be adopted for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>At the international level, this matter is also being discussed by delegations at the preparatory commission with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if she will have considerations made, as a matter of policy, that future telecommunications licensing procedures will be on the basis of tenders and auctions rather than other selection processes in view of the current litigation arising out of the procedure to award both a third mobile telephone licence and the wireless local loop licences and the consequent delays in proceeding with the roll-out of these services and in view of the large windfall to the Exchequer in other EU states; and the reason the Government should continue the policy that would in effect represent subsidies to successful applicants.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Public Enterprise with responsibility for the telecommunications sector, my overriding concern in regard to the approach to be adopted in the allocation of telecommunications licences is to ensure that in each case the most appropriate process is chosen which will guarantee that the economy and the consumer are the prime beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, several options are available to Ireland in terms of licence allocation procedures. These include the holding of auctions, as used recently by the UK in the allocation of third generation mobile licences. They also include the use of comparative selection processes or so-called &ldquo;beauty contests&rdquo;, and the distribution of licences by means of lotteries. It is also possible to use combinations of each of these options.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in reply to a recent parliamentary question on the licensing of third generation (3G) mobile phone systems, arrangements for licensing are, in the first instance, a matter for the director of telecommunications regulation. As Minister for Public Enterprise, I have an overall policy role on the telecommunications sector. The Minister for Finance also has a role in this area regarding the fees that may be imposed for such licences.</P>
      <P>The approach chosen for any licence process will depend on the type and number of licences offered in each case. I do not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to restrict the options available to the director in the way suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the use of auctions, while this option may seem attractive as a means of extracting the maximum amount of money from successful applicants or as a way of avoiding lengthy liti<Col N="366" /> gation, the issue is not as clear-cut as might first appear.</P>
    <P>First, where operators pay a high price, there are concerns that this will simply end up being passed on to the consumer. The high cost can also have a negative effect on an operator's ability in the areas of research and development, infrastructure roll-out, and the delivery of advanced services. Ultimately, while there should be no question of subsidising these operators, a balance must be struck between ensuring that the optimum amount is paid by operators, especially for a valuable national resource such as radio frequency spectrum, and making sure that the user benefits to the maximum extent in terms of the charges imposed and range of services offered by the successful operator.</P>
    <P>As for the question of avoiding litigation, no allocation method, including auctions, has proven itself to be immune from this possible eventuality. Consideration is being given by one of the successful candidates in the recent UK third generation licensing process to the question of bringing a legal challenge regarding the arrangements being made by the UK Government for payment of the fees by some of the other successful applicants.</P>
    <P>On the issue of delays caused by litigation, the Deputy should be aware that I recently enacted a Statutory Instrument, S.I. No. 70 of 2000, which amends the licensing regulations and which, I expect, will reduce significantly the type of delays previously experienced in the issuing of certain licences as a result of legal appeals against decisions of the director. Following the enactment of this S.I., it is now a matter for the courts to decide whether the nature of an appeal is serious enough to warrant the suspension of the director's decision, and I am confident this will have a very positive effect on the licensing process.</P>

It is only to be expected that there will be a variety of views and opinions on matters of such complexity and importance, and I will have regard to such views in my deliberations.</P>

      <P>The capacity constraints on suburban rail routes, including the Sallins to Dublin corridor, arise in the peak hours. The maximum passenger capacity on the Sallins/Hazelhatch/Dublin route during the morning peak is approximately 1,100. The present maximum daily passenger capacity on the route is approximately 5,000.</P>
      <P>Proposals for enhancement of the capacity of this line include proposals for the quadrupling of the track between Hazelhatch and Sallins to separate the long distance and suburban rail services. Final decisions in respect of this project will be taken in the context of the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy update which will be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>The capacity constraints on suburban rail routes, including the Maynooth corridor, arise in the peak hours. The current daily passenger capacity of the Enfield to Dublin route is 13,911 while the current peak capacity is 2,364.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 Iarnród Éireann is currently engaged in doubling the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth. Work on this project is progressing satisfactorily and will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>When this work has been completed it is planned to operate two additional services using eight-car train sets between Maynooth and Dublin in the peak, giving additional capacity of 2,500. These additional railcars are on order and are due to be delivered before the end of this year and will be entered into service following a period of commissioning.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of track beyond Maynooth is almost completed.</P>

      <P>Regarding additional power generation, work has recently been completed on the new gas unit at Poolbeg, which has increased capacity by 160MW from the end of last year. The new IVO plant at Edenderry will add 120MW of capacity, and is now due for completion in December 2000, over six months ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>The ESB has also in the past couple of days applied to me for capital expenditure approval for the lease of five 22MW portable gas turbines, at a total cost of £20 million in order to provide standby capacity at times of peak demand.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, introduced by me, approximately 31% of the electricity market is now open to competition. This will rise to 40% in 2002, and to 100% in approximately five years. This means that any interested party can apply to the commission for electricity regulation for the necessary licences and authorisations to build new plant and start supplying eligible customers.</P>
      <P>In view of the very high level of interest shown by prospective entrants to the electricity market, there is good reason to believe that sufficient capacity will be built to meet market demand.</P>

      <P>The person named claimed a total of 10.35 hectares on her 1999 area aid application. Following processing of her application an area of 9.16 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 1.19 hectares or 13% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore in this case a penalty of 2.38 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 6.78 hectares. The herdowner subsequently submitted a map to the area aid unit in support of her application but this was simply a map of the overclaimed parcel and did not show any additional land area to that already entered on the Department's electronic database. However, the area aid unit has been in touch with her Teagasc advisor and he has undertaken to supply a copy of the Land Registry map for the problem parcel. When this map is received it will be examined and if the boundaries need adjustment amendments will be made and if any extra payments are due they will issue as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to parliamentary Question No. 138 of 7 March 2000 the person named applied for 1998 suckler cow premium on 40 animals on 29 <Col N="379" /> October 1998 and for 59 animals on 4 June 1999 under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the suckler cow premium scheme applicants must be registered herdowners in order to qualify for payments. The person named applied to have the above quoted herd number transferred from his uncle to himself on 30 October 1998. There is a court order against his uncle which has not yet been fully cleared and legal advice is that the herd number cannot be transferred from the uncle to the person named until this matter is resolved. Both the herdowner and the person named have been written to seeking clarification on whether or not the transfer of the herd was made with encumbrances. No reply has been received to date. Consequently, no payments can issue to the person named as he is not a registered herdowner.</P>
      <P>The registered herdowner made a request under the Freedom of Information Act in October 1999 for all records on file in relation to transactions under both TB testing and premium/headage grants and payment thereof since August 1997. This request was granted and copies of all records were forwarded to the herdowner on 25 November 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, in fact, responded to the correspondence from the person in question. He resigned from the Civil Service in 1960 at age 37. Under the superannuation provisions which applied at that time he thereby automatically forfeited any entitlement to superannuation benefits. Section 6 of the Superannuation Act, 1909, was later amended to allow preservation of benefits in the case of established civil servants who, having given at least five years of reckonable service, resigned before age 60. The amendment of the Act applied only to people who resigned on or after 1 June 1973. Any concession in this person's case would, therefore, require amending legislation and would be costly because,<i> inter alia</i>, it would, in equity, have to be applied in the case of all the other people who resigned before the cut off date. The point at issue has been considered by me and my predecessors on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>As regards arbitration, I would point out that under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service, superannuation matters are not arbitrable.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is my intention to complete the move to a system of tax credits by 6 April 2001. In order to accommodate this transition, a number of allowances which were available at the marginal rate of tax needed to be standard rated. The incapacitated child allowance was one such allowance. In budget 2000, I announced that the allowance would be doubled and standard rated, from £800 at the marginal rate to £1,600 at the standard rate. This ensured that there would be no loss to those taxpayers in receipt of the allowance who were paying tax at the higher rate and doubled the value of the allowance to those paying at the standard rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the demand for jobs in the Civil Service has declined. There is a variety of reasons for this not least being the significant expansion of employment elsewhere in the economy which has resulted in ever increasing competition in the jobs market. My department has the problem of recruitment to the Civil Service constantly under review.</P>
      <P>To say that &ldquo;the number of applicants for the Civil Service declined from 29,000 in 1990 to 4,500 in 1999&rdquo; is somewhat misleading and does not reflect the complete picture and the changing circumstances that underpin the recruitment market today. The national competition for positions as clerical assistant advertised in 1994 attracted a candidature of 28,000. That competition was the first to be held in several years and, as a result, the number of applicants was significantly in excess of numbers applying on previous occasions and could not be regarded as the norm.</P>
      <P>In recent years, following analysis of the changing labour market, and in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the recruitment process, a new approach has been taken to competitions for clerical positions. This means that competitions are now advertised on the basis of the geographical location of the vacancies or, alternatively, targeting particular sections of the potential candidate population, for example, former civil servants or persons with a disability.</P>
      <P>In 1999 a total of five such competitions were advertised, attracting approximately 10,000 applications in total.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister, recognise that in this era of increased choice, there is a need to ensure that jobs within the Civil Service remain competitively attractive and that there is sufficient awareness of the advantages of the Civil Service among those considering their employment prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, a number of initiatives have already been undertaken. Two marketing studies have been commissioned, into awareness and perceptions of employment/career opportunities in the Civil Service and the issue of staff retention. Following from these, a high level group, the integrated marketing strategy work group has been established. The objectives of this group include the creation of an integrated marketing strategy, a retention policy and a communication strategy. <Col N="385" /> It is acknowledged that we need to engage in a process of selling the Civil Service as a career which offers significant opportunities for interesting and satisfying work.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives already in train include improved targeting of advertising, more frequently run competitions, a reduction in the timescale of the whole competition process and more representation at the various recruitment fairs that take place around the country.</P>
    <P>As provided for in the Employment Equality Act, 1998, my Department has recently been engaged in consultations with the Civil Service unions on the elimination of age-related remuneration which exists in certain civil pay scales. With a view to improving the attractiveness of the Civil Service, I have agreed that the opportunity should be taken to eliminate the three age points on the clerical officer scale and three of the six age points on the executive officer scale. While this goes further than is required by the legislation, it will have the effect of increasing the starting salary of these two recruitment grades to the Civil Service. The higher starting salaries will feature in the upcoming advertisements for competitions for these grades.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the question of recruitment to the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Expenditure by the public service to date on preparations for the introduction of the euro is estimated to be of the order of £33 million.

      <P>The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the overall policy formulation and monitoring of health promotion activities, and the health promotion unit within that Department is actively engaged in the dissemination of information and the co-ordination of national programmes relating to such issues as smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, AIDS, cancer, heart disease, nutrition, lifestyle, accident prevention, women's health, immunisation, etc. In addition, the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, requires health boards to develop health promotion activities having regard to local needs within the framework provided by the health promotion strategy.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has signalled his commitment to the development of sport and recreational facilities and will provide funding for capital expenditure for this purpose of over £40 million in the Estimates for the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Direct action of this sort is likely to be more effective than the provision of a tax incentive which would be of particular benefit to the more affluent sections of the community, rather than to the lower income groups.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> While it is impossible to give an exhaustive list of criteria on which such decisions will be taken, the Government will, in determining the centres to which Government Departments, offices or agencies will be relocated, have regard to a wide range of issues, including the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and a more even spread of public service jobs around the country. The Government will also be conscious of such other issues as proximity to third-level institutions, communications and transport links, the scale of particular offices being decentralised, capacity of local infrastructure, etc.</P>

      <P>Since 1 July 1999, a common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and community drugs schemes. In order for any item of medicine to be included in the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. One of the criteria stipulates that the product should be one which may be used under the supervision of a general medical practitioner and which is not restricted to hospital or medical specialist use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for the addition of the particular product referred to by the Deputy to the schemes was examined by my Department and, having noted that the manner of administration of the particular product was such that it required administration in a hospital or in a specialist clinic associated with a hospital, it was considered that the product should continue to be administered via such hospitals and clinics. Since it has always been the normal practice that medicinal products administered in such a hospital or clinic are supplied by that hospital or clinic, it was considered inappropriate to include this product as a reim<Col N="390" /> bursable medicinal product in any of the community-based schemes.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the reimbursement or supply of specialised medicinal products, which are ordinarily hospital-specialist clinic-based products, are under consideration by my Department at present. The arrangements for the reimbursement or supply of this product will be considered in the light of the overall examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>James Connolly Memorial Hospital was originally a facility for the treatment and care of persons suffering from tuberculosis. Following its re-designation as an acute general hospital it has been developed and expanded over the years to provide a range of acute medical and surgical services, namely, upgrading and expansion of radiology services including the provision of CT facilities; upgrading of theatres; upgrading of medical and surgical block; and upgrading of out-patients department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that these measures have not fully met the growing needs of the hospital and that some difficulties with service provision have been experienced at peak periods in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> In recognition of the need to address these difficulties a major capital development costing in excess of £60 million is under way at the hospital. This proposed development will replace the older buildings on the site spread over a large area, with a modern facility utilising a combination of new build integrated with substantially upgraded existing structures. When complete the development will lead to improved patient facilities and enhanced services in the following areas: accident and emergency services; intensive care; coronary care; medical and surgical day care; out patients; theatre service; and psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>Enabling works on the site have already commenced on the development in anticipation of the tendering process being completed in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>This major development at the hospital reflects the emphasis on the provision of a modern acute hospital to meet the needs of its catchment area and in the meantime I would like to assure the Deputy that, pending the completion of the project, current facilities will be maintained to the optimum standard in terms of patient comfort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The use of human growth hormone, obtained from human pituitary glands, in the treatment of pituitary dwarfism was common up to 1985 when the use was discontinued. The medicinal products concerned were prepared utilising pituitary glands that were collected at post mortem examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board was aware <Col N="419" /> that these glands were sourced in the countries in which the manufacturers concerned were marketing their products. The collection of pituitary glands at autopsies for this purpose was not questioned at any time and was internationally accepted. In fact, the World Health Organisation established an international standard for growth hormone obtained from pituitary glands which applied for the period that the product was being manufactured. Accordingly, all relevant authorities and experts would have been aware of the source of the hormone and the practice of collecting same.</P>
    <P>I understand that it would always have been assumed that such glands were donated or at least consent had been obtained. However, in the absence of either informed consent or donation I would not be of the view that this practice was acceptable.</P>
    <P>Two authorisations for medicinal products for human growth hormone prepared from pituitary glands were granted by the Minister in 1976 on the recommendation of the then National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that I have recently announced an inquiry which will examine this area and its findings will be included in its final report. In this context, I consider it inappropriate to make any further statement on this matter until I receive the inquiry's final report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>In January of this year my Department made every effort to ensure that hospitals responded to the needs of parents following disclosure of post mortem examination practices and organ tissue retention.  This was in line with the undertaking previously given by the then Minister that a systematic and comprehensive response to the concerns of parents and families would be speedily adopted by all health agencies. It had been clarified to all agencies that this response must ensure that the individual needs of parents and families would and should, at a minimum, include the provision of specific information, counselling and other appropriate support services where required.</P>
      <P>The priority needs at that time were for information and support to parents in an effort to relieve the trauma and renewed grief being experienced.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that the telephone advice to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children was issued by my Department on 13 January 2000 and subsequently confirmed in writing. The Department was trying to ensure that the hospital's response to parents would be appropriate to meet their expressed wishes. This is evident from the written confirmation to the hospital and I am making a copy of this communication available to the Deputy together with a copy of the relevant press statement from the medical board of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that the pathologist's medical condition genuinely necessitated his <Col N="423" /> withdrawal from the meeting and that there is no question that my Department or the hospital in any way orchestrated or staged his departure from the meeting. All of these matters have been fully explained by the relevant Department official to the parents in question at a recent public meeting.</P>

This most commonly arises where a second opinion is required or when technical or professional expertise available in a different institution is required. Organs were and continue to be transferred from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, to other hospitals in contexts such as these.</P>

      <P>The departmental circular sanctioning the application of the revised schedule of allowances, agreed as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike, was issued on 30 November 1999.</P>
      <P>Certain issues regarding the implementation of location allowances in the mental handicap and mental health services were clarified subsequently by the health service employers agency, HSEA, following discussion and agreement with the nursing alliance: on 10 February 2000, the HSEA circulated relevant employers with the list of acute admission units in mental health services which attract payment of a location allowance; and on 7 March 2000, the HSEA circulated relevant employers with details of the implementation arrangements agreed for payment of the location allowance in units for severe and profoundly handicapped in mental handicap services.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing regarding the criteria for payment of the location allowance in respect of secure units in mental health services.</P>
      <P>On 31 March, my Department wrote to the health boards, on my behalf, requesting that they take such steps as are necessary to ensure that all outstanding moneys due to nurses are paid without further delay.

I am not aware of any particular difficulties in the voluntary hospital sector.</P>
      <P>Eastern Regional Health Authority-Area Health Boards</P>

      <P>It is clear from the report of the tribunal of inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Finlay that health professionals have a clear professional duty to report adverse reactions to blood components or blood products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> Following detailed consultations between the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; IMB &ndash; the blood transfusion service board, now the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board, and my Department, procedures for the reporting of abnormal reactions to blood or blood components have been now put in place. The procedures mirror those that already apply in the case of abnormal reactions to medicinal products.</P>
    <P>A national haemovigilance office has been established within the IBTS. The main functions of the office are to receive, collate and follow up reports from hospitals and general practitioners of adverse reactions to blood components. The Establishment Order of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service was amended by S.I. No. 22 of 2000 to provide a statutory basis for the office and also to require it to furnish reports of adverse reactions to blood components to the IMB. The office provides dedicated training and advice to hospitals and health professionals throughout the country and is led by a consultant haematologist.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the establishment of the national haemoviligance office, my Department in March 1999 requested hospitals to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that abnormal reactions to blood components are reported. To achieve this important objective, my Department provided dedicated resources to hospitals to develop and strengthen transfusion medicine including their haemovigilance support service. In 1999 £1.35 million was made available to hospitals to improve transfusion practice and to support the implementation of the national haemovigilance programme. A further £1.6 million has been made available this year.</P>
    <P>This year will see the first full year of operation of the newly established reporting system. My Department in conjunction with the IMB and the IBTS will review the operation of the current haemovigilance system at that stage and determine what further measures including legislative are necessary to improve this system.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on recent comments by a person (details supplied) in County Galway that existing waiting list figures have been massaged to project a serious underestimation of the problem and that those waiting less than three months for hospital treatment are not included in those statistics.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of any manipulation of waiting list information to project an underestimation of the problem. The expert review group on the waiting list initiative that reported in June 1998 considered that a waiting list comprises all persons who, following referral to a hospital consultant, have been listed by the consultant for treatment as a public in-patient or day case and who <Col N="428" /> must wait until the necessary hospital facilities are available for such treatment. Patients who are offered an appointment for treatment within three months of being seen at out-patients are not considered, in this context, to be on a waiting list for treatment. This principle has been applied since the introduction of the waiting list initiative in 1993. The Royal College of Surgeons is currently drawing up agreed protocols for the prioritisation and validation of waiting list cases at my Department's request. It is expected that its report will be available to my Department shortly and will inform consideration of future guidelines in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>The cost of blood and blood components supplied by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; increased by 48% on 1 January 1999. This level of increase was necessary to fund a substantial additional investment in the service in order to meet the highest international standards in transfusion. The additional income was used to fund, <i>inter alia, </i>the full year costs of the blood safety programme, including the costs of the new blood tests, PCR and leucodepletion; the additional costs of ensuring regulatory compliance; the additional costs of implementing the service's reorganisation plan; and the additional costs of implementing the service's consultant manpower, quality assurance and training plans.</P>
      <P>While the service's total income for 1999 rose by £11 million to £42 million, the Deputy will note that because of the developments outlined above, together with the increased cost of recombinant products for persons with haemophilia, expenditure also increased by a similar amount over this period, from £31 million to £42 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department allocated approximately £6.4 million additional targeted funding to health agencies in their allocations for 1999 to cover the <Col N="429" /> increased cost of blood and blood components. This increase was in addition to the general increase allocated to them to cover non-pay price rises during the year.</P>
    <P>The cost of blood components, products and services supplied by the IBTS increased by 2% on 1 January 2000 to take account of general cost increases in the health services during the year and the ongoing implementation of the service's development programme. Health agencies received a 2% increase in their overall non-pay allocation for 2000 to cover price increases such as this.</P>
    <P>The IBTS continues to implement an efficiency programme to achieve greater economy and effectiveness without compromising blood safety.</P>
    <P>In relation to CJD, there is no proven instance of classical CJD having been transmitted through blood or blood products, but the theoretical possibility associated with variant CJD &ndash; vCJD &ndash; cannot be excluded at this time. There is currently no screening test to detect the presence of vCJD. For my part, I will ensure that the IBTS has adequate resources to introduce proven new technologies in this area.</P>
    <P>Experimental animal models suggest that the infectivity of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which include CJD and vCJD, may be associated with white blood cells in animal systems. White blood cells can be removed from blood donations using special filters. This process is called leucodepletion. As a precautionary measure in order to minimise the theoretical risk of transmission, the IBTS introduced leucodepletion for cellular products in 1999, and my Department made available adequate resources for this purpose, as I have explained above.</P>

      <P>According to information supplied by the psychiatric hospitals, there are 1,413 acute psychiatric beds available throughout the country. This represents 39 beds per 100,000 of the population.</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be any international bed norms in this area but I am advised by the inspector of mental hospitals that this ratio is sufficient for our population. However, many acute beds are being inappropriately occupied at present by longer-stay patients. This problem was highlighted in the report by the inspector of mental hospitals entitled, We Have No Beds: An inquiry into the availability and use of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board region, published in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional community-based facilities are required to address this problem. Some progress has been made in recent years in setting up new mental health centres, day hospitals and other day facilities. Additional community-based residential accommodation has also been made avail<Col N="431" /> able. It is intended to accelerate the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation over the coming years with the further development of community-based services throughout the country. Funding has been provided to health boards this year for additional medical, paramedical and nursing support staff, for improvements in psychology and social work services and for the continued development of multi-disciplinary teams.</P>

      <P>The health strategy Shaping a Healthier Future indicated that regional health boards would be renamed as &ldquo;health authorities&rdquo;. While, as of 1 March 2000, the Eastern Health Board was replaced by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the titles of the other health boards have not been changed. I am having the matter reviewed and, in this review, one of the considerations will be the likely cost of a change of title as against the possible advantages of such a change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under eligibility arrangements which were introduced in 1991, beds in public hospitals are formally designated as public, private or non-designated. The Health Service (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, which were introduced pursuant to <Col N="434" /> the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, state that a hospital providing services under sections 52 and 55 of the Health Act, 1970, shall designate every bed, other than non-designated beds as a designated public bed or a designated private bed. The category non-designated beds refers to beds such as intensive care beds which it was not considered appropriate to designate as public or private. The regulations state that bed designations shall be subject to the direction and approval of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, was introduced to, <i>inter alia</i>, give effect to commitments in regard to equity of access, particularly to hospital services, given as part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. Prior to 1991, there was considerable concern that private patients of consultants enjoyed quicker access to public hospitals, not only through the use of private beds but also through &ldquo;queue-jumping&rdquo; into public beds. The first designations came into operation in March 1992. I have arranged for the detailed information requested by the Deputy to issue to him directly.</P>
    <P>Considerable care should be taken in interpreting these figures as there has been a very significant shift towards day cases in the overall provision of hospital care. There has been an estimated increase of almost 100% in day cases in the period 1992-99. This shift towards day case work facilitates a more intensive use of existing beds. In regard to the overall increase of hospital throughput at in-patient and day case level, there has been an estimated rise of 26% during the period 1992-99. Also changes have occurred in procedures in out-patient departments whereby cases can now be treated at out-patient level which previously would have required admission to hospitals.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, while health boards are in a position to designate public and private beds in acute hospitals, any such designations must have the approval of the Minister for Health and Children. Assessment of applications for alterations is based on monitoring information supplied by each hospital to my Department on a monthly basis and on any relevant additional information supplied by the hospital.</P>
    <P>Following the full implementation of the bed designation system a review of hospital beds was carried out in 1993. On completion of this review the number and percentage, of acute beds designated as public, private-semi-private and non-designated were 9,016 &ndash; 73.6% &ndash; 2,500 &ndash; 20.4% &ndash; and 739 &ndash; 6.0% &ndash; respectively. The number and percentages currently are 8,995 &ndash; 73.2% &ndash; 2,528 &ndash; 20.6% &ndash; and 769 &ndash; 6.3% &ndash; respectively. This represents only a marginal increase in the proportion of beds designated as private-semi-private and reflects the specific requirements of developments put in place over this period. It should be noted that the implementation of the national development plan over the years 2000 to 2006 will add extra bed capacity to the public system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> I have initiated a study of bed capacity in response to commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This study will examine both acute and non-acute bed numbers and deal with issues relating to bed numbers throughout the public system.</P>

In the circumstances, it is not my intention at this point to introduce legislation in this area.

The commission will be chaired by Professor Dervla Donnelly and includes medical, nursing, scientific and legal expertise. Submissions will be invited from the public. In addition the commission will consult appropriately to establish the views of service providers, consumers and any adoption issues. The commission will also consult with philosophical and theological experts to ensure that their perspectives are considered and reflected as appropriate in the commission's report.

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and <Col N="437" /> the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. As nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that do not satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over the counter, and may be advertised directly to the public, they are not included in the list of items reimbursable under the list.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know, however, that I have asked the advisory forum to the heart health task force to bring forward proposals in regard to nicotine replacement therapy and the less well off sectors of the community. Decisions on the availability of nicotine replacement therapy will be made in the light of the forum's recommendations. I should also add the recently published report of the tobacco free policy review group, Towards a Tobacco Free Society recommended that nicotine replacement therapy be made available to persons participating in smoking cessation programmes. The projected cost of providing nicotine replacement therapy to medical card holders ranges from approximately £604,000 to £1,800,000 depending on the duration of the therapy and the numbers who might avail of it.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that Department's health promotion unit conducts national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns to encourage smokers to give up and non-smokers to refrain from taking up the habit. The most recent anti-smoking campaign Break the Habit for Good was launched in December 1998 and this campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns. It emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and offers support in the form of an &ldquo;advice kit&rdquo; which in turn offers the support of the Irish Cancer Society's helpline. The campaign continues, by a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for those people wishing to give up smoking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, empowers prescribed road authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers, including telecommunications operators, and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption. Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the Dublin local authorities and the county boroughs of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway were prescribed as authorities which may exercise these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These local authorities have powers to co-ordinate and control road openings by both public and private utilities to minimise the frequency and duration of road openings; to co-ordinate works to minimise traffic congestion and hazards to road users; and to ensure roads are permanently reinstated as quickly as possible. The more complex and extensive road openings by statu<Col N="445" /> tory undertakers tend to occur in the areas of these urban authorities but the question of prescribing additional local authorities is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Road openings in areas other than those prescribed in the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, are governed by section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993, which allows road authorities to give written consent to road openings. A road authority may attach conditions to the consent. Any conditions, restrictions or requirements which a road authority may attach to a permission for a road opening, under the Roads Act, 1993 or the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, are a matter for that authority.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes to enhance local authority powers by obliging telecommunications operators to obtain the consent of the local authority before opening a road to lay underground telecommunications infrastructure. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority would be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions, including reduction in the number of telecommunications related road openings by ensuring road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators.</P>
    <P>Beyond the above provisions, I have recently indicated, in response to the Committee Stage debate on the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, that I would consider the need for a strengthening of legislation to control road openings. This consideration has not yet advanced to the stage of bringing proposals for decision by the Government. In the meantime, I have asked the Dublin Transportation Office to assess, in consultation with the local authorities in the Dublin transportation initiative area, to what extent the approaches taken to the opening and reinstatement of roads and paths for the installation of telecommunications infrastructure could be better managed.</P>

      <P>Practice at roads related inquiries has been that parties are responsible for formulating their own submissions or representations without the availability in advance of public financial assistance towards the cost of obtaining professional advice. However, section 91 of the Local Government Act, 1946, as amended, permits the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to certify, after a local inquiry has been held, that a specified contribution shall be made by the local authority concerned towards the costs and expenses incurred by a person in relation to the inquiry. Long established precedent limits cost awards of this kind to first party objectors and on the basis of objectors being successful in some or all aspects of their case to have the proposed road development modified.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, the approval of major roads proposals is to be transferred from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to An Bord Pleanála. In accordance with section 202 of that Bill, the board will have a discretion similar to that described above in the context of cases which are the subject of an oral hearing.</P>

      <P>The shared ownership scheme is designed to provide home ownership, in a number of steps, for those who cannot afford full ownership in the traditional way. The actual maximum house price for which an applicant will <Col N="447" /> be approved is determined by each local authority in the light of the individual's circumstances and their ability to meet the financial commitments involved. I understand that, where appropriate, the maximum can exceed £100,000.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the scheme, as currently constituted, has been working successfully, particularly in the greater Dublin area. For example, in 1998, some 805 shared ownership transactions were completed nationally. That figure rose by 63% in 1999 to a total of 1,314 transactions. Of these, some 70%, amounting to 926 transactions related to the greater Dublin area. The effectiveness of the scheme will continue to be monitored by my Department in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 259 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. It is also available to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass-holder free of charge. The person concerned has not submitted an application for the companion free travel pass scheme.</P>
      <P>A review of the free schemes was recently published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to all people with disabilities and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass-holders are quite capable of travelling alone. In this regard, the review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a companion pass should be issued to all people with disabilities who are unable to travel alone. The review estimates that the cost of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to all people in receipt of invalidity pension, regardless of their disability, would be in the region of £1 million.</P>
      <P>The report examines a large number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years. Child benefit continues to be paid up to age 19 in the case of children who are still in full-time education and children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The rate of payment is currently £34.50 per month for each of the first two qualified children and £46 per month in respect of the third and subsequent qualified children. The structure of the child benefit scheme ensures additional resources are targeted at the larger families, who are at greater risk of poverty, through the existence of a higher rate of payment in respect of the third and subsequent qualified children.</P>
      <P>The rate of child benefit payable is not determined on the basis of the place of each individual child within the family; rather it is determined on the basis of the number of eligible children in the family. Where one of a family is no longer a qualified child for child benefit purposes, the overall rate of benefit payable is adjusted in accordance with the number of remaining qualified children. I consider this approach to be reasonable.</P>
      <P>The value of child benefit as a means of channelling child income support is reflected in the very substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. Most notably, the 2000 budget provides for an additional full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing the total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the value of the child benefit scheme will continue to be exploited to the greatest possible extent. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment that child benefit will be substantially increased over the period of the programme, with a priority focus on moving towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 to 267, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to Questions Nos. 171, 172 and 173 of 16 February 2000.</P>
      <P>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has been signed but cannot be ratified by Ireland under current wildlife legislation. The necessary provisions to enable the state to formally ratify the convention are included in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999 which is currently under consideration by the Oireachtas. As international trade in endangered species is a worldwide problem, the signature and ratification of the convention by as many states as possible, including Iceland, is to be welcomed. In relation to the recent meeting of the parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species held in Nairobi last month, I understand the proposals put forward to downlist certain whale species to facilitate trade were defeated. Ireland, though not a party to the Convention, was represented at the meeting and strongly supported the rejection of the downlisting proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that scientific whaling may legally be undertaken by any party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. In addition, Norway and Russia may legally engage in commercial whaling as they lodged an objection to the current moratorium on commercial whaling. Iceland is not currently a party to the ICRW but is considering whether to rejoin so that it is prudent to take account of its likely stance, which is to support resumption of commercial whaling and possibly to engage in scientific whaling. In these circumstances it is not realistic to propose a total ban on whaling and we can only secure the conservation of whales through a voluntary consensus. In this context the proposals put forward by Ireland for discussion at the International Whaling Commission meeting in 1997 represent a balanced package designed to stimulate real discussion between all interests in the IWC with a view to limiting and controlling all whaling and thus securing whale conservation in the medium term. The details, including the duration, of any agreement based on the Irish proposals must await detailed discussion among member countries to achieve the necessary consensus for the adoption of an agreement by all parties. The duration of such an agreement has not been defined but, while Ireland would like to have an agreement which would last forever, that is not likely to be come about in the immediate future. Ireland will seek to negotiate the longest term possible but I would consider that an agreement which eliminated the present free-for-all and reduced the number of <Col N="455" /> whales being killed over a period of 20 years would be a significant achievement and would provide a platform which could be extended for further periods in the future. If such consensus can be reached, the intention is to draft suitable texts within the legal ambit of the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling to reflect any agreement reached. While the proposals put forward for discussion pose difficulties for all sides to the debate within the IWC, if the necessary will is present, a suitable voluntary agreement is possible. From Ireland's viewpoint, any agreement reached regarding the control and regulation of whaling must ensure that the conservation status of any whale population is not compromised.</P>
    <P>The Irish proposals fully recognise the importance of enforcement and provided <i>inter alia</i> for the completion and adoption of the IWC revised management scheme. This scheme must be conservative and provide in particular for inspection and observation procedures that will engender public confidence. I understand that work on this scheme at the IWC is well advanced and it includes proposals for satellite monitoring, DNA tracing of meat and international observers on whaling vessels. A transparent, effective, and strict monitoring system is a vital part of an acceptable RMS which should be strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the threat posed by over exploitation of some populations of small cetaceans. While many member states, including Ireland, hold the view that the International Whaling Commission has competence in relation to small cetaceans, there is significant disagreement on this issue and many states do not accept IWC competence for small cetaceans. However, a modus operandi has evolved which allows small cetacean issues to receive attention within the IWC. In these circumstances there is little chance of achieving a consensus in relation to small cetaceans and it would not be useful to pursue this in the Irish proposals.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, Fingal County Council is required to consult my Department in respect of any pro<Col N="456" /> posed alterations to this protected structure. Should the Council request any technical assistance in respect of any proposed works, I will be happy to make my officials available.</P>
      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of such buildings. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the heritage council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that I recently launched the ACCESS programme which provides grant assistance for the development of cultural infrastructure, under which the council may qualify for funding, depending on the future use of the building.</P>

      <P>The rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, requires participants to farm their lands in an environmentally friendly manner. To meet the needs of social partnership that Department, together with Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, farming organisations represented in the social partnership, and other relevant experts met to determine appropriate environmentally friendly farming practices for the Burren.</P>
      <P>All parties agreed that in the high Burren the objective was to maintain the traditional extensive agricultural practices of the area and to prevent a further increase in stock levels. It was also agreed that in these areas cattle should be predominantly dry stock and that the land should be grazed in winter and not in summer, i.e. grazing of stock other than feral goats should be avoided from April to October. As an exception a short period, one-week, of grazing in June to control grass growth may be agreed on a farm by farm basis. These prescriptions do not apply in the reclaimed or intensively farmed lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prescriptions apply to all REPS participants, with land in natural heritage areas or proposed candidate SACs, in the Burren, and will <Col N="457" /> apply to farm plans approved by my Department for non&ndash;REPS participants in the same area.</P>

      <P>However, I must point out that the mound on which the cross is situated is entered in the record of monuments and places for County Mayo, thus affording it protection under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994.

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to an individual area is a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that there is a continuous Garda presence consisting of mobile and foot patrols in the Howth village area. I am also informed that, in the summer months and at weekends, additional foot patrols are deployed in the Howth village and seafront area. An additional mobile patrol is also available to respond to public order incidents.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the measures currently in place are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their continued effectiveness and this is reflected in the fact that there has been no substantial increase in the level of reported crime in the Howth sub-district over the last number of years.</P>

      <P>I should add that the Government, as already indicated to the House by way of reply to previous questions, has agreed in principle to the establishment of a commission on licensing. Included in the commission's remit will be to review the scope for a system of additional licences and to examine other aspects of the licensing system. The details of the terms of reference of the commission will be a matter for final determination in the light of discussion with relevant interests.

      <P>It is not the general practice to comment publicly on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with the expectation by the applicant that such confidence will be preserved.</P>
      <P>However, the position in this instance is that the applicant was interviewed on 10 May 1999 and it was decided that he does not qualify as a refugee in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees as amended by the 1967 protocol and as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  A refugee is defined as a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
      <P>The applicant appealed this decision on 16 December 1999 and his appeal was heard on 9 May 2000 by an independent appeal authority. At this time my Department is awaiting a recommendation from the appeal authority.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the main problems in this area are concerned with joy-riding and anti-social behaviour. As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Síochána have introduced Operation Steering Wheel specifically to deal with the problem of unauthorised takings, joy-riding incidents and public order offences in the area. I understand that a local joy-riding task force is currently drafting a document which will be submitted to the relevant departments for funding to establish a joy-riding diversion programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also informed that there is a community police garda permanently assigned to community policing in the area. This member liaises with local community representatives and deals with problems which arise. As part of their overall strategy to deal with such incidents, the gardaí have liaised closely with Dublin Corporation in order to have plinth walls etc. constructed to alleviate the problem. Work carried out by Dub<Col N="464" /> lin Corporation to date has resulted in an improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>The crime statistics over the past number of years illustrate that there has been a slight decrease in crime in the identified areas. Quite a significant number of arrests have been made for unauthorised takings, drug offences, public order offences and anti-social behaviour which illustrates that the gardaí have taken positive action to deal with problems.</P>
    <P>Bi-monthly meetings are held at Coolock Garda station, attended by representatives of each Neighbourhood Watch Scheme within the sub-district and members of the community policing section of Coolock Garda station. As a result of the efforts of the gardaí, excellent community relations have been established which has resulted in continued co-operation between the gardaí and the local community.</P>
    <P>Garda management will continue to meet frequently with residents from the areas concerned and public representatives. I have asked the Garda authorities to keep me advised of developments.</P>

      <P>The right to work for asylum seekers is based on the Government decision of 26 July 1999 which allowed asylum seekers to seek employment once they had applied before that date, had been 12 months without a final determination in relation to his-her asylum application and had been compliant with their obligations in the asylum process. On 14 December 1999 the Government dispensed with the require<Col N="466" /> ment for work permits for asylum seekers eligible under the previous decision of 26 July.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a specific case. In that specific case the applicant has completed the asylum process and has challenged his deportation by judicial review in the High Court. He is no longer covered by the aforementioned Government decisions. Accordingly, the issue of withdrawal of the entitlement to work does not arise.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person referred to in the Deputy's question received a work permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment late last year. At that stage, the person was not entitled to work in the state. A request to renew the permit earlier this year was not granted, as the requirement for a work permit had been abolished and he was not issued with a letter of permission to work as he was not entitled to same.</P>

I should point out, however, that when gardaí receive a complaint about neighbours playing loud music at night, they can request the occupants of the house complained of to lower the noise levels. The Garda powers in this regard relate to ensuring that a breach of the peace does not occur.

      <P>The Government decided last September that asylum seekers should be resettled around the country and have their needs met by direct provision. The directorate for asylum support services was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department and is responsible, <i>inter alia, </i>for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers or applicants for refugee status. The directorate has been <Col N="467" /> accommodating asylum seekers under these new arrangements since 10 April last.</P>
      <P>Prior to 10 April 2000, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers was handled, in the main, by the Eastern Health Board in whose administrative area the majority of asylum seekers are located. Since last November, however, the Eastern Health Board has had to accommodate asylum seekers in accommodation sourced by the directorate.</P>
      <P>Due to the acute shortage of accommodation in Dublin it was necessary to advertise in the media for offers of suitable accommodation. Arising from these advertisements, the directorate has entered into contractual agreements for the provision of accommodation in various hotels, guest houses and hostels around the country. The assessment of the suitability of offers of this type of accommodation is ongoing and other options with regard to the provision of accommodation are being pursued. At present, because of the severe shortage of accommodation and asylum seekers cannot be left homeless, the availability of suitable accommodation is the key criterion in the allocation of asylum seekers around the country. In the longer term, as more accommodation comes on stream, my aim is to achieve a fair and balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the country and to have particular regard, among other relevant factors, to the size of local communities when deciding on the number of asylum seekers to be placed in them.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements in place since 10 April asylum seekers are being accommodated by the directorate at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one-two weeks for the purposes of needs assessment, the provision of information and processing of the initial stages of their asylum applications before being resettled at other locations around the country. The directorate has five reception centres in the Dublin city centre area with a total capacity of 400, approximately.</P>
      <P>The table below provides details of the locations to which asylum seekers have been dispersed to date. Details of capacity are also provided.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. My Department received the application in October 1999. Following consideration of the application by this Department and by the Chief State Solicitor's Office, in January this year, I consented to the transfer of the person concerned. The necessary documentation, as required under the convention, was subsequently returned to the United Kingdom authorities for their further consideration. The consent of the Home Secretary and the formal consent of the person concerned is now awaited. On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, the matter will be referred to our legal advisers to make the necessary application to the High Court for a warrant authorising the person's transfer and continued detention here.</P>
      <P>I should point out that both the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, require that extensive documentation be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his-her continued detention here.</P>
      <P>These procedures are required under the convention and must be adhered to in processing each application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered. However, I can assure you that my officials are in contact with their counterparts in the UK Home Office regularly to ensure that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order, 1997, made under section 22 of the Refugee Act, 1996, currently gives effect to the State's rights and obligations under the Dublin Convention. Under that order, a determination on whether to transfer an asylum request to another convention state is taken by an officer of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform designated for this purpose under subsection 22(4)(a) of the Refugee Act, 1996. The determination takes into account the criteria set out in articles 3(7) and 4 to 8 of the convention, regarding the links of the applicant to other convention countries. There is an appeal mechanism which an asylum applicant can invoke against a determination that his or her application be transferred to another convention country. Such a provision is not required by the convention itself but was made a requirement by the Refugee Act, 1996, as an extra safeguard. Ireland is unique in this regard among EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation order is currently being revised in the context of the implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immi<Col N="470" /> gration Act, 1999. Under the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, the function of determining whether an application should be transferred to another convention country becomes the responsibility of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion on 3 April 2000, to the effect that Ireland, by restricting the right to parental leave to employees with children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996, had not fully complied with its obligations under clause 2(1) of the framework agreement on parental leave annexed to Directive 96/34/EC (Parental Leave Directive). My Department has examined the reasoned opinion, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, with a view to identifying the measures to be put in place to give effect to it. My Department has met with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &ndash; ICTU &ndash; and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation &ndash; IBEC &ndash; in relation to implementation of the reasoned opinion. Consultations with the European Commission are also ongoing. In order to ensure that the reasoned opinion is responded to in an expeditious manner, it would be my intention to amend the Parental Leave Act, 1998 by way of regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provided an allocation to my Department for targeted actions for women over the life of the plan. A portion of this budget will be allocated to initiatives designed to increase women's participation in decision making. In this connection, my Department will be working with organisations with expertise on this issue to develop appropriate projects in this area. It is my intention that the representation of women in political life will be one of the areas targeted for positive action measures.</P>
      <P>I should point out that it is the responsibility of the political parties themselves to ensure greater participation of women within their structures.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women made a number of recommendations regarding women in the political process. These include the abolition of the dual mandate in respect of simultaneous representation in the Oireachtas and local authorities or councils and in the Oireachtas and European Parliament; a positive action programme for political parties; nomination of equal numbers of women and men candidates for panel seats in the Seanad and introduction of legislation for gender quotas if there is not a sufficient number of women Deputies within ten years of the commission reporting.</P>
      <P>My Department has brought these recommendations to the attention of the political parties on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1999 local and European elections, my Department wrote to the main political parties asking how the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women would be implemented in respect of those elections. The responses were published in the third progress report on implementation of the commission's recommendations in March 1999.</P>

      <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 April 2000 and was signed into law by the President on 26 April 2000. It is my intention to <Col N="472" /> bring the Act into operation in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Under section 25 of the Act, it is a matter for the Director of Equality Investigations to investigate complaints of discrimination. Once the Act is in operation, a complaint of alleged discrimination, on any of the discriminatory grounds, may be made to the office of the director. Section 75(5) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, provides that the director shall be independent in the performance of her functions. In the light of the independent role of the director in investigating complaints, it would not be appropriate for me to advise, in any individual case, on the possible application of the legislation to a particular service or as to whether one or other of the permitted exemptions in the Act might apply.</P>

      <P>The system whereby bed and breakfast accommodation is listed is a voluntary one and operators who do not wish to be listed by Bord Fáilte is not prohibited from carrying on its business.</P>
      <P>However, statutory requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene apply to all providers of tourist accommodation, whether listed or unlisted, the latter having the major disadvantage, of course, of no access to official marketing support through Bord Fáilte, the Tourist Information Office network of the RTAs and the Gulliver reservations system.</P>
      <P>Personally speaking, I deeply appreciate the contribution of the bed and breakfast sector to Irish tourism and recognise the need to encourage and develop the sector. As a mark of that commitment, last year I launched a new initiative targeted primarily at the small accommodation provider, whereby Bord Fáilte would carry out a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category are branded and marketed overseas with a view to increasing business overall and particularly in off-peak season and in rural areas.</P>
      <P>A sum of £300,000 was set aside in 1999 for this initiative, with £500,000 being allocated this year. This initiative is available only to listed accommodation providers, and I am confident it will considerably expand the range of support offered to the sector, thereby making listing an even more attractive proposition for bed and breakfast providers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that my Department has conveyed approval for a number of major school extensions at both primary and second level in the Lucan area. In recent years a new multidenominational primary school and an all-Irish community college in the area were given recognition by my Department. It is expected that these measures will significantly alleviate pressure for school places in Lucan in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study on the school accommodation needs of the Lucan area was carried out by the technical working group of the Commission on School Accommodation. This report, which was intended primarily to inform the deliberations of the commission's steering group, was completed in May 1999. Among the points made in the study were <Col N="476" /> that the increase in housing had not impacted significantly on existing schools in the area at that time; there was surplus capacity in some existing primary schools; and co-operation and enrolment management by the post-primary schools was optimising the use of available accommodation.</P>
    <P>The study went on to recommend that sites for a primary and a post-primary school should be reserved in the Adamstown area and my Department has requested South Dublin County Council to do so.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern to ensure that Lucan retains the capacity to cater for all local first and second level pupils and I assure him that my Department will continue to monitor developments in the area on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>I am aware that from time to time difficulties can be experienced with the introduction of transport services for pupils with special needs. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that, under present arrangements, every effort is made by my Department to provide suitable transport for all pupils attending special schools and special classes at primary level. If the Deputy has concerns about a particular service or area and if he would like to provide the relevant information to my Department, I will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>In the event that it is not possible to provide a special service, a transport grant, towards the cost of private transport arrangements is paid to the parents-guardian. The rate of grant payable depends on the mileage involved and the amount paid is subject to school attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> In 1997, my Department secured funding for payment of enhanced grants, in individual exceptional cases. Under this provision, a family may appeal the level of transport grant and where appeals, which are based on family circumstances, are found to be genuine, special payments of up to 50p per mile can be sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The provision of special transport services is reviewed annually. It is my intention to continue to keep such special supports under regular review and to address, where possible any inadequacies that may be experienced with the system.</P>

      <P>These schools have recently received details from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland of the outcome of a survey of radon gas in the buildings. This survey of all primary and post-primary schools was undertaken by the RPII at the request of my Department following indications of high radon levels in some schools. The results of the first phase of the three year national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow have been issued to the schools concerned. These results indicated that none of the rooms tested in 511 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200, Bq/m3, above which remedial action is advised.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining 174 schools the RPII advised that 13 schools, showing the highest level of radon, including Kilmainhamwood primary school, require attention as soon as possible. Nobber primary school is not among these 13 schools. My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. The mitigation programmes for five of these schools have been completed. The remaining eight schools, including Kilmainhamwood, have been inspected by the consultant and appropriate mitigation programmes are expected in my Department shortly. It is planned that the works will be undertaken during the school summer holidays.</P>
      <P>The consultant will then consider and advise on the most suitable mitigation programme for the remaining schools including Nobber. In the absence of the advice of the consultant I cannot say at this juncture when the appropriate action will be taken in Nobber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I cannot estimate what the cost of the works will be I am pleased to say that the full cost of the mitigation programme will be borne by my <Col N="478" /> Department. Meanwhile, all schools nationally have been advised by my Department of the measures to be taken to ensure that radon gas, where it may exist, is not a problem.</P>

      <P>From the commencement of the current school year, the homeschool-community liaison service has been extended to all first and second level schools which have disadvantaged area status. As the school in question does not have disadvantaged status, it was not included in this extension of the service.</P>
      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, the educational research centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers. The responses from schools, which are now being assessed by the Educational Research Centre, will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school, including the school in question.</P>
      <P>Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered as part of this process. I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the allocation of £5 million which was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently formulating details of a scheme for an after schools support service in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas. In the case of the primary sector, schools will be selected on the basis of criteria being developed by the educational research centre for the new more targeted child centred programme which I am introducing following a survey of all primary schools. The grant to each school would cover the cost of a co-ordinator and other personnel and would include other operating costs such as insurance, heating and lighting. It is envisaged that this scheme will be operational in the schools selected by September next.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 a grant of up to £180,000 was allocated to the community youth project in Dublin 5 under the young people's facilities and services fund towards the salary and programme costs of two youth workers over a three year period. This community youth project caters for young people in the ten to 21 age group.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the young people's facilities and services fund, established by the Government in 1998, is to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and services and divert them from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 to 326, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992 to 1999, the governing body and the director of an institute of technology are responsible for the management and control of the affairs of the institute. The appointment of staff of the institutes is governed by section 11(1)(b) of the 1992 Act. Under this section the selection and appointment of staff is a function of the institute in accordance with the procedures determined by the Minister from time to time. The selection procedures, as approved by the Minister, stipulate that all vacancies must be advertised. The institute is responsible for ensuring strict compliance with the approved procedures.</P>
      <P>The calculation of starting pay for academic staff is a matter for the institute of technology in accordance with the conditions as set out in appendix C of Memo V7. These conditions apply to all institutes of technology and would be available to the staff from the Institutes. A copy of appendix C follows for the Deputy's information.</P>
      <P>My Department has received no representations on staff appointments at the Institute of Technology in Tallaght this year. My Department has been in contact with the institute and has been assured that all appointments are being made in accordance with the approved procedures.</P>
      <P Just="Center">APPENDIX C.</P>
      <P>CONDITIONS FOR THE AWARD OF INCREMENTS TO ACADEMIC STAFF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.The normal expectation is and will continue to be that appointees will be admitted to <Col N="484" /> the relevant salary scale at the minimum point of the scale.</P>
    <P>2.The main, if not, the only, circumstances to be taken into account in recommending salary above the minimum in any particular case are that that proposed appointee has (i) experience which may be regarded as appropriate to the requirements of the appointment being offered and deemed to be of comparable level and-or (ii) experience in business, industry or other analogous fields of a character and at a level which, for the purposes of the grant of incremental credit, may by equated with the experience mentioned at (i) and (iii) earnings in the twelve month period prior to appointment which exceed the minimum point of the relevant scale. Claimed earnings must be supported by confirmation from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>3.In any appointment the number of increments to be awarded above the minimum point of the appropriate salary scale may not exceed five, the sixth point of the scale, except with the express approval of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>4.The attached circular letters set out the conditions for the award of incremental credit for previous teaching service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330 to 334, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the debate concerning the best method of teaching deaf children and the changes in methods that have occurred over the years. The views of the Irish Deaf Society and of the parents they represent in regard to bilingualism as an approach to the education of deaf children, with Irish Sign Language as their first language, have already been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Following representations from parents a special class was established in St. Joseph's Special School, Cabra, in which the bilingual approach is followed. Special needs assistants with competence in Irish Sign Language have been allocated to the school to support the teachers and pupils in the use of this approach. In addition, training courses in Irish Sign Language have been held for teachers of deaf pupils to equip them with necessary skills. Such courses will continue to be supported. This will enable teachers to meet the needs of those pupils whose chief method of communication is through the medium of signing.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that no single method of communication is suitable for all deaf students. In this context, the assessed needs of each individual child are of central importance when, in consultation with the child's parents, decisions are being made regarding appropriate educational provision.</P>
    <P>I have asked senior officers of my Department to make suitable arrangements to meet a delegation from the Irish Deaf Society and the model school for the deaf committee, to discuss their concerns, including those raised by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Butléir, was published in February 1995. A number of the recommendations of the committee have already been implemented, such as the abolition of the requirement of separate academic attainments for the award of a third level grant, the introduction of new arrangements for second-chance students and the establishment of a budget to assist students at college who are encountering financial hardship. The maintenance grant schemes have also been extended to candidates pursuing full-time undergraduate study of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in other EU member states, with certain exceptions.</P>
      <P>A single and simplified application form for the grant schemes was introduced in 1995 and, following the introduction of the post leaving certificate scheme in 1998, a composite application form for all four schemes of student support was introduced in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the recommendation that the information provided on grants should be upgraded and be available through local schools, <Col N="487" /> considerable progress has been made. Information booklets and leaflets have been available for a number of years from the administering bodies and from the Department. This information is also readily available on the Department's website. An information leaflet was included with the 2000-01 CAO application form and it is planned to make available a further booklet entitled A Guide to Grant Assistance available for Further and Higher Education 2000.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations in the report was that income tax relief in respect of covenants in favour of children aged 18 years and over &ndash; with the exception of covenants to handicapped persons &ndash; should be phased out and the revenue used to increase direct expenditure under the student support schemes. The Deputy will be aware that the restriction of income tax relief on covenants to individuals in 1995-96 was linked to the introduction of the free fees initiative.</P>
    <P>The schemes of student support are subject to on-going review and the other recommendations of the report are considered in this context. Officials of my Department have been engaged with officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in a detailed review of the administration of the student support schemes and on the options for the future administration of these schemes. This process is on-going.</P>
    <P>Any proposals to change the administration of the schemes would have major implications, for example, for the local authorities and the vocational education committees. Therefore, it is my intention that there will be full consultation with all interested parties before any decisions are taken in relation to any future arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>the number or retired male and female teachers who are former members of religious orders and who are not benefiting from the 1994 national agreement in relation to full recognition of years served in capitation schools.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement referred to by the Deputy was made under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work. The PCW agreement provides for the full recognition for pensions purposes of teaching service given by a member of a religious order on the approved staff of a capitation national school. Under previous agreements, made in the 1970s, it was possible for half of such service to be reckoned as pensionable.</P>
      <P>Such service, known as capitation service, was not pensionable when given because members of religious orders in capitation national schools were not paid personal salary by my Department. In order for capitation service to be reckoned as pensionable in full, the PCW agreement provides that a contribution of 5% of pay at retirement, or 6% where the teacher is a member of the spouses' and children's pension scheme, should be deducted from the retirement lump sum in respect of each year of such service given from 1 July 1968, the date from which the national teachers' superannuation scheme became a contributory scheme.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that these provisions would apply in the case of teachers in pensionable service on or after 1 February 1996. All teachers, including current and former members of religious orders, who gave capitation teaching service and have retired since 1 February 1996 are now benefiting from these provisions.</P>
      <P>My Department keeps records of the numbers of teachers who retire each year but does not maintain separate records of the numbers of such teachers who are or were members of religious orders. An examination of the files of those who retired in 1999 shows that about 8% of primary teachers who retired in 1999, i.e. 46 teachers, gave capitation teaching service.</P>

      <P>Two inspectors of my Department, one a primary inspector and the other a post-primary inspector, met the retired teacher in question on 29 November 1999. The inspectors concluded that the teacher's approach to concept development is sound and is in keeping with the approaches embodied in the revised primary curriculum. They discussed the possibility of the teacher promoting his ideas to a wider audience through the network of education centres and the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>Last September, all teachers were issued with curriculum statements and teacher guidelines on all the subjects, including mathematics, of the revised primary curriculum. By the end of June 2000, they will all have been invited to attend two two-day seminars and two planning days, dealing with an overview of the revised curriculum and either Irish or English. In the years ahead, it is intended that all teachers will attend seminars on the other aspects of the curriculum, including mathematics. The precise order of the mathematics seminars in relation to the other subject areas has not yet been decided. However, at the meeting between the retired teacher and the two inspectors, the feasibility of affording the teacher an opportunity of outlining his ideas to the group of teachers who will be seconded to the primary curriculum support programme as mathematics trainers in due course was explored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully recognise the importance of ensuring that teachers who work with pupils with high levels of special education needs are appropriately trained for their task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students who attend St. Patrick's College and Mary Immaculate College follow a module on special education of 30 hours duration. A lectureship in special education has recently been allocated to the Church of Ireland College of Education. In addition to providing training in special education to students there, this post will also be used to meet the training needs of second level teachers who work with pupils with special educational needs. Two expert groups on the pre-service training of teachers will report later this year. The training of teachers in special education is among the issues being considered by them. A training programme already exists for those <Col N="492" /> teachers who work full time with pupils with high levels of special educational needs. The diploma in special education course in St. Patrick's College of Education is available to 25 teachers every year. It is a full time post graduate course and has been in existence for over 30 years.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently approved a series of new in-service programmes for second-level resource teachers. The aim of the programmes will be to provide substantial theoretical and practical training for these teachers. These programmes will begin in the 2000-01 school year and will be offered by the Church of Ireland College of Education. The training will be provided to a large extent by specialists from within the country. However, it is anticipated that experts from outside the state will be involved in some specific areas.</P>
    <P>A range of other in-service supports are provided for the teachers in question.</P>
    <P>Although the special education department in St. Patrick's College of Education is not designated as a support centre, it fulfils that role by answering requests for advice and information from teachers, parents and others. The staff also provide a variety of induction and in-career courses for teachers in special education.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering the question of support services in the special education area generally. This includes the training of staff.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that arising from my recent visit to the USA, I have decided to fund ten placements for teachers who work in the area of special needs to spend time and train in innovative educational establishments in the US, studying their practices and assessing the potential for using them in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Other professionals who may provide support services to pupils with special educational needs follow a range of courses at third level to equip them for their work.</P>
