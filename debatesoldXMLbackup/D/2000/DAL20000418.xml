    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met Mr. Charles Kennedy MP, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Mr. Lembit Opik MP in Government Buildings on Tuesday, 28 March. We had a general discussion about the current political situation in Northern Ireland. I expressed my appreciation to them for the keen interest which they have shown in the process and I thanked them for their ongoing support for our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, 31 March, I met Mr. Paul Murphy, Secretary of State for Wales and Mr. Rhodri Morgan, First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales. Our discussion centred on the potential for further developing co-operation between <Col N="471" /> Ireland and Wales. We also discussed Northern Ireland related issues.</P>
    <P>I met separately with Mr. Gerry Adams and with Mr. David Trimble on Friday, 31 March. I met with the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition on 5 April and with the Progressive Unionist Party on 6 April. On 12 April I met with the SDLP and on 13 April I met with The Workers Party. The meetings were part of an intensification of engagement with the parties in order to overcome the current difficulties.</P>
    <P>As I have said before in this House, I condemn all attempted bombings and other attacks by dissidents as well as all so-called punishment attacks and exilings. I have consistently urged, both privately and in public, that all such activity should cease immediately. I would again acknowledge the consistent efforts that have been made in recent years to reduce the numbers of such attacks. It is clear from the experience of the past six months that such efforts can be very effective and I would hope that these ongoing efforts would intensify and we would soon see a reversal of the recent tendency towards a recurrence of such attacks. It is deplorable that punishment attacks continue to be carried out by loyalists and republicans.</P>
    <P>I emphasise to the House that while clearly we are in a difficult situation, we continue to make considerable progress in the implementation of the Agreement. We have seen substantial reforms in the equality and human rights area. In Northern Ireland, a Human Rights Commission has been established and is now holding consultations on the possible contents of a Bill of Rights. These are huge advances. We look forward to the implementation of the proposed reforms of the police service and the criminal justice system. In this jurisdiction, the Government has enacted equality legislation. Legislation to establish a human rights commission is before this House.</P>
    <P>All of the pro-Agreement parties recognise the need for a major fresh collective effort by all the parties to carry into operational effect the Agreement so overwhelmingly endorsed by the votes of the people of Ireland, North and South. The two Governments are working intensively with the parties to resolve the difficult issues which we face. We all recognise the critical need to move forward and achieve the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister has judged that the time is right for him to consult again with the parties and for that reason he is visiting Belfast today. The Prime Minister will then come to Dublin where the two Governments will jointly take stock. In the light of this, we will decide how best to take matters forward with the parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much valuable work has been done in recent weeks by the two Governments, but much remains to be done. In deciding how best to make progress, we have been consulting with all the parties. It is now the highest priority of both <Col N="472" /> Governments to take this work forward to completion at the earliest possible date. To be successful, we clearly need the support of all sides, including a willingness on the part of all to reach out and try and create the necessary confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concentrate on the two issues I had in mind when I tabled these questions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that some progress has been reported on the matter of the disappeared and that searches have started again since I submitted this question. However, does the Taoiseach agree that this is a matter for which no one but the republican movement can be blamed? It is not the responsibility of the British, of the Unionists or of the Northern or Southern States or police forces. Members of the republican movement murdered these people, hid their bodies, lied to their relatives and took away their reputations. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is the responsibility of the republican movement to find and return their bodies and that the republican movement should not be let off the hook in this regard? </P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there are other missing bodies for which the IRA has not accepted responsibility but for which it is known to be responsible? I refer to people such as Gerry Evans from south Armagh and Charlie Armstrong.</P>
      <P>In relation to my second question regarding people who have been ordered out of Ireland under threat of injury or death, does the Taoiseach agree that while we do not know the exact number, hundreds of people have been ordered out of the country by republicans and loyalists? They have been described in the <i>Irish News </i>as the invisible victims of the troubles. Entire families have been forced out of Northern Ireland to relocate in England and elsewhere. It is two years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in which at least some responsibility was placed on the paramilitaries to do something about these matters. In some respects what is happening to these individuals and their families is worse than a prison sentence. At least in prison a definite release date is given. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that this matter and the issue of the disappeared will be pursued with the same urgency as other issues which are the responsibility of the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. As the Deputy has continually urged me to do at Question Time, I will do all I can to try to ensure the bodies of the so-called disappeared are recovered. As he is aware, in recent months Mr. Wilson has received some new information. While the commission continues to receive information, it has been slow to act without hard facts. The generalised remarks made last year caused much trauma for the families concerned. The information provided was loose and centred on a general geographical location. Whenever the commission has received information of sub<Col N="473" /> stance it has taken action. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I support such moves. The Garda Síochána has been involved. We will continue to raise the matter. I do not know how many people have been ordered out and forced into exile during the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Hundreds at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the peace is real, the people concerned should be allowed to return to their homes. As I said to the Deputy many times, over the past five years I met some of the large number of groups campaigning on behalf of the disappeared and the exiled. I agree totally with the Deputy, it is a source of enormous trauma. They live in the slight hope that the people concerned might be alive, although they know in their hearts that it is more likely that they are dead but until their bodies are found and there is a Christian burial they will continue to suffer. I have raised the matter time and again with limited success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach on the extent to which he agrees with me in these matters. The republican movement has whinged about the way in which others allegedly have not lived up to their responsibilities. These are two extremely important matters on which it clearly has not lived up to its responsibilities. Does the Taoiseach agree that it should never be allowed to forget this and that these matters should be put in front of it continually in this House and elsewhere? This is the only way we will get progress on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no differences between the Deputy and I on these issues which I have raised continually. On the first of them some advances have been made but on the second few advances have been made. While the information provided on the disappeared has proved to be of some help, it has not been anything like satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will avail of the opportunity to raise the matter in his next press conference with Gerry Adams?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach like to respond to that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise the matter in his next press conference with Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness or any of the others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week in the Dáil the Taoiseach said he hoped by last weekend he would have an agreed position with the British Government on how to move towards restarting the <Col N="474" /> Executive and cross-Border bodies. Was that target achieved and, if not, why not? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the two Governments finished on Friday. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and I had a number of discussions over the weekend. In so far as we can take it, it is near complete. The only aspects outstanding are those on which we are listening to other people's views before completion. We have fairly well tied down the work between the two Governments, what we want to do as regards full implementation and where we want to bring it, but we have to deal with constitutional, criminal justice and human rights issues. The House could help by dealing with the human rights legislation which was published many months ago. I understand it will be before a committee tomorrow and it would be of enormous help if it completed it this week. We have agreed on most aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned a number of issues, all of which are laudable but none of which are the reason for the Executive coming to an end. Have the British and Irish Governments reached an agreed position on the question that led to the suspension of the Executive? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between the position of the British and Irish Governments. It is a question of whether we can implement what we agree on. I do not know the answer to that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the two Governments are agreed on what they would like to happen. I presume that has been the case for many years. However, have the two Governments agreed so far on a precise way forward for dealing with the unresolved issue of the disarmament of paramilitary organisations, the failure to deliver upon which was at the heart of the suspension of the institutions? Have the two Governments an agreed way forward on that matter? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as helpful as I can to the House. The two Governments have a clear view of what we agree on and the best way forward. It is not much use the two Governments setting down something if we cannot carry everyone with us. We now want to see if we can get agreement. As I said in my reply and at all stages of this Agreement, it is an inclusive process and has been for many years and the two Governments are working towards that. The only way to get success and to reach conclusions is by carrying the people and the parties with us. That is what we are endeavouring to do. I cannot answer the question as to whether we will be successful. We are down to a small number of processes that we think would lead us to full implementation of the Agreement and to deal with that issue, but we need to win support for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Question No. 5 which concerns the Taoiseach's meeting with Sinn Féin, has Sinn Féin put forward any suggestions or proposals on how the decommissioning question might be resolved? Has Sinn Féin addressed the issue of asking the IRA to agree to the Mitchell principles of non-violence in the same way that Sinn Féin has already agreed to them? If the IRA was to do what Sinn Féin has already done, it would then be saying that the war was over and that it was committing itself to disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not got the type of agreement the Deputy mentioned. However, a considerable amount of effort is being made to try to find a satisfactory way forward. Whether it is enough or can be tied down is an ongoing issue. As the British Prime Minister said in Belfast this morning, the gap between the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin still exists. There is not too much of a gap between the other parties at this stage, but it has to be bridged. What is important is how we do that. Discussions are taking place but it would damage our efforts if I gave details of the points on which they centre. We are trying to bridge the gap but there is some way to go. In recent weeks there has been a greater commitment and concentration on trying to resolve matters than there has been for months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this is not just a question of a gap between two positions of equal value where, as a broker, one is trying to fix on a middle point of agreement? Does he agree that there is a difference between political parties signed up to principles of non-violence but who are associated with paramilitaries who have not signed up to those principles, and a normal political party with no paramilitary links? Suggesting that it is a question of trying to bridge a gap between the two is to imply that such an essential qualitative difference does not exist and that this State does not have a clear position with regard to the acceptability of parties with paramilitary links. Would the Taoiseach care to reformulate his approach other than in terms of bridging a gap which suggests a moral equivalence of position? I have no doubt this is not his view but such a formulation is open to such a misconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in his interpretation of my view. I would not wish what I said to be open to any construction other than that I support democracy and oppose violence. However, I am conscious of what we are trying to do. We are trying to carry political parties with clear paramilitary associations. We are trying to convince them once and for all that we see an end to violence, to armed conflict and to the mayhem of the past 30 years. While it is easy for me to say that, it is another thing to achieve it given all that has happened. We wish to bring movement with regard to a conclusion of such activities and not <Col N="476" /> just move to a situation where someone else continues them.</P>
      <P>We are making an effort to demonstrate what we know to be absolutely right. We will not solve all the problems we wish to solve, but we are trying to bring this conflict to an end. We have to convince those engaged in violence and who do not see things through democratic eyes that we wish to see an end to conflict. The situation is delicate. Deputy Bruton and I know that these people do not always listen to the language he and I use.</P>
      <P>The Mitchell principles which were the start of this process are principles to which I am totally committed. As happened before in the history of this State, our efforts must be to try to get people away from the mentality of armed conflict and violence so that they end such activities in an organised and ordered way. It will not be easy to achieve this objective but that is what we are engaged in and what I am determined to try to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach received and studied the proposals on a way forward which I sent to him, the British Government and to all political parties in this House and in Northern Ireland? This proposal is based on two elements. First, the signing up to the Mitchell principles by all parties and all of the paramilitaries associated with them who have not done so and, second, a renunciation by the British Government of any intent to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland Executive if re-established. Has the Taoiseach considered this proposal and will he incorporate it in his thinking and his discussions with the British Government?</P>

      <P>I have received them and I thank the Deputy for the effort put into them. We would, of course, always take them into account. In terms of what one can achieve in negotiations, it is difficult to convince others to sign up to them. Naturally, I have no difficulties with them. However, we will continue to try to reach a conclusion.</P>
      <P>We are at the stage, once again, where we are endeavouring to find a way forward by carrying all the parties with us, in a way which is not just a recipe for further failure. I trust and thank the parties for their efforts. They have put in a considerable amount of effort over the past few weekends. We will continue to try to do that. The Irish and British Governments will sign off very quickly on our stated position and our ambitions for the future. However, we know we need to carry people with us &ndash; otherwise, we will not succeed. That is the difficult part.</P>

      <Col N="477" /> In regard to Question No. 6, and a similar question in my name concerning the meeting with the Ulster Unionist Party, has the Taoiseach received a letter from that party concerning allegations that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 10 March, to the effect that information was passed to the IRA by a member of the Garda Síochána? Has the Taoiseach responded to a letter on that point from the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party? Was the matter discussed by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party with the Taoiseach when they met? Has the inquiry into the matter, which was initiated by Commissioner Byrne after I wrote to him on 13 March, concluded yet?</P>

To demonstrate our concern about any such allegations in the case of the RUC, we must display similar concern, publicly and privately, when such a serious allegation is made about the Garda Síochána, however loath we might be to believe such an allegation could have any truth.</P>

        <b>:</b> Would the Taoiseach agree that the overwhelming desire of people in Northern Ireland is for a lasting peace and that that desire is continually being thwarted on the one hand by paramilitary organisations, which do not have a mandate from anybody but whose existence is seen as a threat, particularly in communities of another tradition, and on the other hand by those politicians who continue to jockey for sectarian political advantage rather than putting the well being of the entire community first? Would the Taoiseach agree that if a number of elements were introduced unconditionally it would lay the basis for moving quickly beyond the present position? Would he raise with Prime Minister Blair the withdrawal of the British military machine from all areas in Northern Ireland where their presence is resented by the residents, that all paramilitary organisations should pledge that they will not threaten anybody and, in fact, that they should disband, and that there should be a move immediately to the creation of a genuine unarmed community police force working with and in alliance with all communities? Would the Taoiseach agree that if those elements were put in place we would move to an agenda where the well being of the entire community would come first?</P>
      <P>The 2,000 firefighters in Northern Ireland have had extremely difficult and dangerous lives for the 30 years of the troubles. Their lives have been put at risk on many occasions. Today will the Taoiseach raise with Prime Minister Blair the decision by the Northern Ireland fire authority to worsen significantly the conditions of Northern Ireland firefighters by withholding the Northern Ireland allowance from new recruits and also by threatened cuts in the annual leave of firefighters, arbitrary transfer procedures and the loss of certain overtime rights? Would the Taoiseach agree that, despite the improved conditions in Northern Ireland, firefighters continue to face an extremely difficult and dangerous situation which places them in a category operating above and beyond the call of duty of other workers; and that they should not be treated in such a shabby fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the firefighters, I note what the Deputy has said. Deputy Higgins asked if I agreed that life would be better if <Col N="479" /> sectarianism, paramilitaries, decommissioning and demilitarisation were all dealt with; of course I would. If we could achieve it before Easter, it would be a happy Easter. However, these are all major difficult important issues but they are the key issues which create division, mistrust, hatred, bigotry, etc.</P>
      <P>I detect &ndash; it is useful for us to say this here &ndash; from the many groups from Northern Ireland I have met over recent weeks that, while there are still punishment beatings and some activities, all of them, both the political parties and the community and civic parties, want to emphasise that the first quarter of this year was one of the quietest. People are out and about at night, families are living normal lives again, there is quite a lift evident in economic activity and even their beleaguered tourism industry is beginning to pick up. Hopefully all those signals and messages which are evident to the community will help the respective leaders, and the two Governments who are working with them, to make the necessary final moves. The <i>status quo</i> can never be maintained. If progress is not being made things can slip in the other direction. The marching season is not too far off and we know the dangers attaching to this each year. Those dangers will again exist this year if we do not make political progress, and in some cases even if we do make progress those dangers will exist. We must try to continue to work with the issues as Deputy Higgins said and try to find as much agreement and progress as possible.</P>
      <P>The issues mentioned by Deputy Higgins, including the review of policing and the Patten report, the review of the criminal justice system, equality legislation, the Ombudsman and the human rights review are taking place and are in operation. Advanced progress is being made on all these issues which has proven very useful, something activists on the ground are saying. If we could get the institutions up and working we could make considerable progress. For the institutions to be up and working progress must be made on demilitarisation on one side and decommissioning on the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins said there are many places in Northern Ireland where the wishes of the communities must be listened to, communities in places such as south Armagh where 99.99% of the people are Catholic and <Col N="480" /> have been seeking for many years to get some of the more obtrusive security installations removed. This is supported by all parties, including very strongly by Séamus Mallon who has the longest record in terms of fighting for this. We must have progress on this issue. There has been some progress in terms of demilitarisation, which is important. The Deputy knows my views on decommissioning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that using a phrase like &ldquo;to get the institutions set up again we have got to have progress on the one hand on demilitarisation and on the other hand on decommissioning&rdquo; suggests that in his eyes these two issues are on a similar plane and in some sense are equal and opposite aspects of the same problem? Is that the view he wishes to give somebody who is the head of a legitimate government which has an army under democratic control? Will he agree that to put that army, or any other army like it, on the same plane as a paramilitary group is not what one would expect him to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Bruton knows very well the difficulties with all these issues, including the arguments on demilitarisation and decommissioning. Following the Deputy's logic, he is making a grave mistake in saying that the argument for demilitarisation is only being put forward by republicans. The Deputy is entirely wrong in this regard. Demilitarisation is put forward by the entire community in these areas, including those who support the SDLP, Sinn Féin and neither party and those who do not vote. Therefore, the basis of the Deputy's argument is incorrect and fails to understand the situation in these areas.</P>
      <P>Demilitarisation is a big issue in these communities. Thankfully, these people have now had six years of almost no activity, but they have more troops and more police and army activity than ever and this creates difficulties in communities as expressed by religious leaders. There is also much sympathy from people in other parties representing unionism. I have heard these difficulties raised by senior people in other parties. Therefore, I ask the Deputy not to put the issue in an adversarial way. He either misunderstands the issue or is trying to put it in a way which seeks to say I am trying to have an equivalence when he knows I am not. The Deputy should desist from such comments. Decommissioning must be dealt with if we are ever to succeed and, as I stated several times earlier, we will continue to try to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree my concern was with the phraseology he used which clearly implied equivalence? The precise words he used had that implication. We both know one must be careful with one's choice of words and my concern was solely with that. Does he further agree that I also concur that demilitarisation is an <Col N="481" /> urgent matter and that when I held his position I urged the case for demilitarisation in certain areas with the same force he has, but I do not regard it as on the same moral or political plane as decommissioning? They are two entirely different issues. Decommissioning concerns the activities of paramilitary organisations that are not under any form of democratic control whereas demilitarisation concerns winding back the mistaken and foolish activities perhaps of armies that are under democratic control. This is a different issue and it should not be seen as equivalent.</P>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 10, when the Taoiseach met the PUP, which is associated with the Ulster Volunteer Force, a paramilitary organisation with substantial lethal capacity, some of which has been or could be used against people in this jurisdiction, did he ask Mr. Ervine if he would consider it constructive for him to ask the UVF to be the first organisation to put weapons beyond use now that we have changed our Constitution in such a fashion that it no longer contains any claim over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland to the land in which they live and, therefore, the threat which might have justified the UVF taking the view that it had to wait for the IRA to make the first move because its constitutional position <i>vis-à-vis</i> here was not as clear as it wished? Did the Taoiseach put the argument to the PUP that as a result of its actions in signing up to the Good Friday Agreement that is no longer the case and, therefore, the circumstances now exist in which to help resolve the issue and that the UVF should be asked to be the first to start a process of disarming and set a example rather than continuing to hide behind Gerry Adams and the IRA, as it is doing?</P>

      <P>I have raised the second issue, our constitutional change, the relationship with Dublin and the atmosphere in the PUP. One of its delegation, at least, has met and explained various political changes to people in the UVF and the Red Hand Commandos whose attitude to Dublin is very different today than it was in the past for reasons such as the constitutional change and other matters. Unfortunately, I could only detect that we are unlikely to see any move by loyalist organisations until the greater picture is resolved, as they see it. They will not make any pre-emptive moves. That seems to be their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that representatives of the PUP get an irresponsibly easy ride from everyone, both in the media and in politics, as they are able to talk in reasonable <Col N="482" /> tones as if they were similar to members of the Alliance Party, people sitting in the middle trying to help everybody to agree, while they continue to be associated with a dangerous paramilitary organisation which refuses to make any move to disarm and that they are just as responsible for the current impasse as Sinn Féin or the IRA? While I would be the last person in this House to sympathise with Sinn Féin, it is unfair that all the emphasis is on what Sinn Féin cannot get the IRA to deliver when the failure of David Ervine to get the UVF to deliver a single bullet to General de Chastelain is just as irresponsible.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the associate of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UDA, has stated that it accepts the Mitchell principles on non-violence? While it has accepted that there should be disarmament and punishment beatings should cease, it has not commenced a process of disarmament, even though it agreed it would do so two years ago when it accepted the Mitchell principles. The UDA continues to perpetrate punishment beatings and shootings in direct defiance of the sixth Mitchell principle.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that these loyalist politicians are hypocrites who are being given the easiest of rides by the media and everyone else? Now that we have amended the Constitution, they should be asked to decommission to help us to get the IRA to do what it should have done long ago.</P>

Why is the Taoiseach reluctant to give me an assurance that he will raise the difficulties faced by a cross-community group of workers, the fire-fighters, with the British Prime Minister?

People like David Adams, Gary McMichael, David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson face a difficult task in their communities, steering paramilitaries and those involved in other violent activities away from violence and maintaining the ceasefire.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I want to make it quite clear that responsibility for the ongoing dispute regarding the clothing to be worn by Irish track and field athletes competing in the Sydney Olympic Games rests squarely with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Athletics Association of Ireland and only they can resolve it.</P>
      <P>In common with the majority of the Irish people, and especially in my capacity as Minister, I am anxious that the 2000 Olympic Games should not see a repeat of the very unsavoury and public differences that occurred between the Irish athletics and Olympic organisations in Atlanta in 1996.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months I have been in contact with both the Olympic Council of Ireland and the relevant athletics organisation &ndash; originally BLE and more recently the Athletics Association of Ireland &ndash; urging them, in the strongest possible terms, to resolve their difficulties in relation to the gear issue well in advance of Sydney 2000. The Irish Sports Council has also been involved in similar contacts.</P>
      <P>Despite our best efforts, however, and despite reassurances from both bodies that they would endeavour to have the matter resolved, they remain entrenched in their conflicting positions. Disappointed at the failure of the council and the association to find a compromise, and seriously concerned at the effect the dispute could have on our athletes as they prepare for the biggest event of their sporting lives, I recently took the unusual step of writing to the relevant international organisations &ndash; the International Olympic Council and the International Amateur Athletics Federation &ndash; seeking clarification and guidance in the matter. In reply, I was informed that the Association of the Summer Olympics International Federations, including the IAAF, is to discuss the gear issue at a meeting which takes place in Lausanne tomorrow, 19 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, in the course of separate meetings which I held with the senior representatives of the OCI and the AAI, both undertook to meet <Col N="485" /> promptly to consider the outcome of the Lausanne discussions and to report back to me immediately thereafter, hopefully with an agreed resolution.</P>
    <P>I assure this House of my continuing commitment to having this matter resolved in the interest of our athletes whose psychological and mental preparation for the games is as important as their physical fitness, in the interest of preserving Ireland's image abroad and, not least, in the interest of the Irish sporting public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree our top athletes are being used as hostages in a power struggle between the two organisations, the Olympic Council of Ireland and the AAI, which, in signing their respective contracts with Adidas and Asics, knew they would be entering into confrontation with each other as a result? Does he agree that not only have these organisations treated our athletes in a despicable way but they are bringing the good name of Irish sport into disrepute?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister demanded &ndash; I use the word &ldquo;demanded&rdquo; rather than requested &ndash; that these two organisations submit their respective cases to an independent mediator or arbitrator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to all the Deputy's questions is yes. I acknowledge the co-operation I have received from all sides of this Houses on this thorny issue. I understand that in the post-Atlanta period, the Deputy tried to bring this matter to a conclusion and that he informed them of his disapproval of the events which happened in Atlanta. Unfortunately, this matter has gone on. They have undoubtedly tarnished the image of Irish sport in the past and are making an effort to do so again.</P>
      <P>I have not demanded but requested that an arbitrator or a mediator-arbitrator be appointed but this has been refused. In fairness to the Athletics Association of Ireland, I must make it clear that it has come forward and is prepared to compromise. It has brought forward proposals to me in order to compromise and is prepared to accept mediation and arbitration. I hope that is the way forward. Unfortunately, the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland is entrenched in his position and he sees no need for arbitration. As has already been pointed out, if he feels so sure of his footing in this instance, I see no reason he cannot accept a mediator-arbitrator.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that this unedifying spectacle is totally at variance with the Olympic charter which seeks to build a peaceful and better world and requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play? Does he further agree that, in effect, the Olympic Council of Ireland is thumbing its nose at the Minister, the Government and the Dáil, bringing the image of the country into disrepute and putting pressure on our athletes, that this conduct is totally unacceptable and that the Olympic Council of Ireland should take up the <Col N="486" /> Minister's offer given that the Athletics Association of Ireland has indicated it will take up his offer of mediation?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister make a specific proposal and put a time frame on this issue? This cannot be allowed to drift on because the country is being brought into greater disrepute as each day passes. What are young people looking at this spectacle thinking? Young people involved in sport are witnessing this type of carry on and athletes are the last people to be considered. This spectacle is all about rule books and positions.</P>

      <P>This squabble, which should have been settled at national level, is now on the international stage and will be discussed at Lausanne tomorrow. I am not hopeful in regard to the meeting in Lausanne. It is totally against the spirit of the Olympic movement. The leader of the Olympic movement in Ireland appears to be totally entrenched and unwilling to compromise on this issue because he says and he appears to have right on his side. I am not here to decide who is right and who is wrong. There should be a compromise. Some 200 countries are involved in the Olympic movement and this country is the only one which has not resolved this dispute. I cannot put a time frame on this matter.</P>
      <P>There were reports in the media yesterday suggesting that certain athletes could be just spectators. I would like to clarify that. The point being made is that an athlete who does not sign a contract with the Olympic Council of Ireland will not go to Sydney. That is the bottom line about which the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland has told me. Athletes have to sign this contract and accept whatever happens after it has been signed. We must understand that these Olympic athletes will sign the contract &ndash; there is no question about that &ndash; because going to the Olympics is the pinnacle of any athlete's career. These athletes will sign the contract and will undoubtedly go to the Olympics but, unfortunately, their mental attitude to these games is being disrupted. I hope there will be a resolution and that the issue can be taken out of the public domain as soon as possible.</P>

Will the Minister consider using the ultimate sanction of withdrawing or substantially reducing funds to these organisations until such time as they act in a decent way, but not this year because we do not want to affect the performance of our athletes in an Olympic year? I appeal to those at the top on the Olympic Council of Ireland to put Ireland first and not their own powerful positions, to come to their senses and think of the country before themselves. I appeal to these organisations to submit to an independent arbitrator or mediator for the sake of the good name of Irish sport.</P>

I informed them that this issue must be resolved before we meet to discuss the strategy for next year and that, given that funding will be withheld next year if they do not resolve the issue, they should resolve it before this year's Olympics rather than after.

The movement sees itself and sport as building bridges between people all over the world and as a means of promoting peace, but that perception has been totally shattered by this ongoing sham battle which is not about any substantial issue but is really about power bases. I support the call from the Minister and Deputy Allen for the two bodies to get together and, in a constructive spirit, in a spirit of solidarity, resolve this matter quickly in the interests of the country, because we cannot possibly allow a repetition of the incident that occurred in Atlanta in 1996 involving one of our best medal prospects at that time, Sonia O'Sullivan.

      <P>The regional tourism authorities were established by Bord Fáilte, under the Tourist Traffic Acts, for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis. In line with the commitment set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, Bord Fáilte initiated a review of the RTAs during 1999. The objective of the review is to ensure that RTAs are positioned to make the optimum contribution to the realisation of national tourism objectives and targets set by Government while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus. In the context of the review, a report <Col N="488" /> on the RTAs was commissioned by Bord Fáilte from Fitzpatrick Associates.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the review will help to achieve an improved delineation of RTA functions and objectives within overall State tourism architecture. Discussions are currently nearing conclusion between officials from my Department and Bord Fáilte on issues arising from the review process, and should be completed by early May. Once these discussions have been finalised, I expect that Bord Fáilte will call a meeting of representatives of the RTAs with a view to informing them of the outcome of the review and setting out their vision for future RTAs.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there are far too many bodies dealing with the whole tourism area.

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, has now been published and includes an outline of the Government's proposals for the development of the tourism industry over that period. Under the plan, I have succeeded in obtaining in excess of £350 million specifically for tourism marketing, product development and training over the next seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan provides for two regional operational programmes, one for the Border, Midlands and Western Region and one for the Southern and Eastern Region. The £100 million, which I have <Col N="489" /> obtained for development of tourism product, will be delivered under these programmes. These programmes will also include funds under the aegis of other Ministers in areas such as marine leisure, angling and rural tourism, while expenditure in the cultural development and micro-enterprise areas will also support the development of tourism product.</P>
    <P>My Department is negotiating with the Department of Finance on the tourism content of these programmes. The programmes will have to be agreed by the regional assemblies and forwarded to Brussels. It will take another few months for Brussels to sign off on the operational programmes. It is possible, that it may be into the autumn before all the relevant structures are put in place.</P>
    <P>As the operational programmes are under negotiation, Deputies will understand that I cannot go into too much detail on their possible content. Nevertheless, I have made it plain on more than one occasion that the focus should be on the creation of a small number of strategically located major attractions in areas where such do not already exist, the clustering of existing smaller-scale attractions and the development of special-interest activities, especially those involving a combination of outdoor pursuits such as cycling, walking and horse riding as well as developing activities for disabled visitors.</P>
    <P>As the national development plan indicates, the bias of tourism product spend will be towards those areas which are less developed in tourism terms. Strengthening these areas will be part of a strategy to distribute the benefits of tourism more widely.</P>
    <P>As far as decision-making structures are concerned, I have proposed a continuation of the independent product management board model &ndash; one for each region &ndash; which worked well during the lifetime of the last tourism operational programme. However, delivery mechanisms and institutional arrangements for the operational programmes are still under consideration.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a thorough awareness and information campaign by the relevant tourism bodies, and I also envisage that there will be competition for the product development funds. Bearing that in mind, it would be unrealistic to expect major product decisions before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As soon as details of the operational programmes are agreed with the regional assemblies and the European Commission, all the regional tourism authorities will be given full details of the type of product eligible for support under the plan and asked to embark on an information and awareness-creating drive in their regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the programme. However, the concerns that gave rise to this question relate to the time lag towards the end of the year. If the regions do not know what is available to them until the end of the year it will be difficult to plan effectively <Col N="490" /> for the new tourism season. Does the Minister agree it is vital that information is made available as speedily as possible? Is there any way in which he can brief those organisations on what is likely to arise so we do not lose momentum in marketing and developing our tourism product?</P>

      <P>To clarify the issue, the money under the national development plan is going towards marketing and training. As regards the product and what can be applied for, these issues are for the next operational programme. On marketing, I have had discussions across the tourism industry with the unions, ITIC and Bord Fáilte and we have put plans in place for a marketing strategy that I will announce shortly. They are satisfied we have come to an agreement on that issue. We will not know until well into the autumn the criteria as regards grant aid for a tourism product, be it a leisure centre or whatever, as we have not agreed them with Brussels.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation if he will consider setting up a tourism showcase involving the participation of the private sector due to the huge skills shortages in the tourism industry with the main objective of this tourism showcase being to attract foreign nationals to work in the Irish tourism sector. [11596/00</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>A report commissioned by CERT and published last year entitled &ldquo;Hospitality 2000&rdquo;, quantified the skills shortages facing the tourism industry up to 2005. This report highlighted two major challenges facing the industry, namely the recruitment of new entrants and the retention and development of existing staff.</P>
      <P>CERT has been working with industry partners to address the challenges set out in the report. Implementation of the recommendations will require the industry to commit additional resources to develop and retain valuable staff and find ways to achieve excellence and improve productivity with the same or fewer people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Meanwhile CERT is continuing to promote recruitment to the industry through a variety of strategic interventions which to date have proved important in maintaining recruitment numbers to formal craft level training. The main objective of these interventions is to highlight to young people, those returning to work and other categories of potential employees, the advantages of a career in a fast growing successful industry.</P>
    <P>Recently, I launched CERT's new nation-wide programme to encourage people who have been out of the workforce for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry. This follows on from another scheme launched in May 1999 in Ballymun, targeted at long-term unemployment blackspots, which has proved very popular and successful, with participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses.</P>
    <P>As the State tourism training agency, it is part of CERT's remit to help promote careers in hospitality and tourism and, in conjunction with the sector, to help recruit people into training for the industry. Each year it organises a major recruitment campaign in Ireland. The campaign is implemented in partnership with representatives from the Irish Hotels Federation, Restaurants Association of Ireland, Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association and is targeted at second level students from transition year to leaving certificate level. It includes a national careers road show which is supported by a major media and advertising campaign. As part of this road show, personnel from the main employer bodies attend and give first hand experience of work in the industry and, in the case of IHF members, this usually involves tours of their premises. CERT also attends the main career exhibitions, together with representatives of the IHF and RAI.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In 1998, in response to ongoing staff shortages in the industry, CERT initiated a pilot recruitment drive in the UK to attract Irish tourism workers back to Ireland. Both the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland were approached to participate in the project. However, the project failed to meet its targets and was not continued. Since then, tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Wales and Scotland which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. They are due to participate further in focused recruitment in England, France, Spain, Sweden, Finland and Greece. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, which welcomes employers to participate with it at these fairs. I understand the Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual hotels are also participating in EURES, the European Employment <Col N="492" /> Service, to help satisfy labour supply in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that a number of private sector recruitment agencies are actively engaged in recruiting workers from overseas for employment in the hospitality industry. Under the new national development plan, my Department will work closely with CERT to identify the most appropriate focus for its activities in the future and the specific measures which should be taken to help address the requirements of the industry in an increasingly competitive labour market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree we must expand the focus of the recruitment drive particularly as 87% of restaurant owners in the west have great difficulty in getting staff? Is the Minister aware that 120 new hotels opened in the past two and a half years? They are quality hotels but unfortunately do not have a quality service. There are 40 hotels planned for this year, but there are not any staff. Will the Minister look seriously at the future role of non-nationals and at having a recruitment drive early in the year when it would be possible for people to give a commitment to work in the industry? There are 8,000 vacancies. Does the Minister agree that while CERT is doing an outstanding job, training must be industry led in the future?</P>

There is a pool of Irish labour into which we are still trying to tap. We are trying to get as many long-term unemployed Irish people back to work. Two weeks ago I introduced a return to work programme to people &ndash; men but more particularly women &ndash; who had been out of the workforce for a long period asking them to come back into training. There is a vast pool in the age group 35-plus who for various reasons, perhaps child-rearing, being involved in voluntary work and so on, have been out of work and who could be enticed back into the labour force. It has been very successful and we had to set up extra training in some areas. CERT has been doing tremendous work.</P>

      <P>The Government has provided annual funding of up to £10 million in the Vote of my Department since its establishment for the drugs initiative, which has been used to implement over 200 pilot projects in the action plans of the local drugs task forces, pending evaluation as to suitability for mainstreaming. This funding is transferred, on request, to other Departments and agencies who oversee the operation of the individual projects and act as channels of funding to the approved projects. Expenditure under the drugs initiative provision in the years 1997-9 has been £1,584 million, £3,888 million and £4.941 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>In this context, mainstreaming refers to the process whereby projects which are evaluated and found to be effective, continue to receive funding, as appropriate through relevant Departments or agencies in accordance with agreed protocols. Evaluation has commenced and conclusions are expected to become available from this process from the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Government has approved continuation of the local drugs task forces for a further two years and has allocated a further £15 million over the two years to enable them to up-date their action plans.

      <P>In 1997 the Government approved funding for more than 200 projects from the local drugs task forces plans at a cost of £10 million. Since then on an annual basis an amount of £10 million has been provided for the national drugs initiative. To date, £11.33 million has been drawn down by these projects with a further £2.8 million being processed. This amount includes interim funding to those projects which have used up their initial one year budgets pending their formal evaluation. A total of 131 projects are in receipt of interim funding. A question that has struck me since coming into this Department is that while we have funds, why are more projects not being submitted? When I meet the national drugs team I shall ask why they are not using the money available. It is certainly not being refused.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sports Council's recently finalised Statement of Strategy for 2000-2002 includes the planning for, and support of, the future development of Irish sport in association with a number of agencies. A copy of the strategy will be laid before each House shortly.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Irish Sports Council is currently working on its proposals to develop local sport and recreational programmes, through the establishment of local sports partnerships.</P>
      <P>In developing these proposals the Irish Sports Council will engage, in the course of this year, with the relevant statutory agencies and community and voluntary interests in identifying the issues which need to be addressed. They expect to have final proposals ready for consideration by my Department in the context of the Estimates for 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the Irish Sports Council will identify the needs of local sports partnerships. Is this not passing the buck further? Is the Minister aware, while acknowledging the finance provided to national organisations, there are thousands of sporting and youth organisations throughout the length and breadth of the country which get little or nothing to assist them in providing sport, recreation and youth facilities? For example, in my county council area the vast majority of sport organisations get about £100 per year. What will he do about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of organisations dealing with youth and sport throughout the country. I disagree with the Deputy who said there are thousands of them. He must understand the youth and sport organisations do not come under the aegis of my Department. My Department has responsibility for the sports capital programme whereas my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, has responsibility for youth and sport. We have an agreement with the VEC which is the medium for funding youth and sport organisations. I agree that perhaps there should be more funding since we are all seeking to increase our budgets. I presume the Deputy is speaking from an administrative point of view. Youth and sport organisations do not come within my Department's area of responsibility and administration is dealt with elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree with an observation made to me recently by a visitor from abroad who said there is very little to do in Dublin, and perhaps throughout Ireland in general, for young people who do not drink? Is it part of his strategy in fund raising these grounds to find alternative recreation and sporting outlets for young people who do not drink? The Minister <Col N="496" /> will be aware, as I am, of the concern expressed recently by responsible medical and other people who see the damage caused by alcohol which is as bad as that caused by drugs. Is it part of the Minister's strategy to provide more outlets which are not drink related?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the policy of the Department under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan. I hope we can implement such a policy. Some £25 million has been provided under the youth facilities scheme, all of which has yet to be drawn down. During the Deputy's Administration the URBAN programme was committed to it. It is a matter of getting all the facilities which came under the URBAN programme, my colleague's programme and those which come under the aegis of my Department to do something about it. A great deal of money is involved. In my Department's capital programme, for example, £31 million is currently committed to more than 900 projects. The combined effect of the URBAN project which was administered by Deputy Allen and the current programme will be to make more facilities available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Irish Sports Council presented me with the report and told me of their plans for the future. The council is determined that there is little point in setting up a sports council unless it can achieve something. The calibre of those involved in the council is very high.</P>
      <P>The council has not made any proposals regarding the amount of funding required to implement its policy, which it intends to do after 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 45, 48, 56 and 265 together.</P>
      <P>Following on the Taoiseach's announcement of the Government's decision to proceed with plans to build a campus of sporting excellence and national stadium, to be known as Sports Campus Ireland and representing a total investment of £281 million, I have discussed this topic in the House on a number of occasions through parliamentary questions, most recently on 8 March and previously during a special debate on 9 February.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware of the Government's decision to proceed with plans to build a campus of sporting excellence, including an 80,000 all seated national stadium, to be known as Sports Campus Ireland. This decision was informed by the feasibility study carried out by the consultants to the stadium steering committee and the committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Having been identified by the consultants and recommended by the steering committee, the site at Abbotstown in west Dublin was accepted by the Government as the optimum location for the proposed sports campus and stadium.</P>
      <P>Since I answered questions on this matter on 8 March last, the Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company that will take the project through the design and construction stage has been established. The board of the new company, which is chaired by Mr Paddy Teahon, currently Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, met for the first time on 29 March last, when it was addressed by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself. An advertisement for executive services had been published with a closing date of 28 April. One of the first tasks of the company is to examine the feasibility of providing some of the infrastructure for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003, including an aquatic centre.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the board of trustees, in whom the Sports Campus Ireland asset will be vested, will be established in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he has thought through this matter in detail? Is he aware that the cost of moving the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development facility is £60 million? Has that cost been part of the Minister's calculation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> What is the status of negotiations with the FAI and others whose co-operation with the project was proving difficult to achieve?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations with other Departments is a matter for the Department of Finance. Those negotiations are ongoing and will be discussed by the Cabinet at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The Sports Campus Ireland project is going ahead. A development company has been appointed. The campus was intended to provide an infrastructure for all the national sports governing bodies and national organisations so that no organisation would have to enter into financial commitments to build a stadium for itself. The FAI has decided to go ahead with its own project. The association will be welcome at any stage to join in the national stadium project. That would be my preferred option. However, the FAI wishes to have its own emotional home and I am prepared to accept that decision while continuing with the development of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reassess the projected cost of the stadium, which has been estimated at £280 million, given that people who know about stadia claim this project will cost between £400 and £500 million when it is completed?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the matter in the light of the recent statement by Mr. Seán Quinn, iar-uachtarán Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, that the GAA should consider allowing multifunctional use of Croke Park? This statement allows for the possible use of Croke Park by the IRFU. Before the Minister spends any more taxpayers' money on Sports Campus Ireland will he enter into realistic negotiations with the GAA regarding the multifunctional use of Croke Park?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I met officials of the GAA last week and I was also invited to address the GAA annual congress banquet on Saturday evening and at no time were any of these matters raised with me. The GAA released a press statement at 1 o'clock today which I will read to the House. It states:</P>
      <P>Following recent speculation and assumptions based on a report of discussions which took place at a workshop at congress in Galway last weekend, the GAA wishes to affirm that its policy in relation to its use of grounds has not changed.</P>
      <P>The GAA is already on record as welcoming and supporting the Government decision to proceed with the development of a national stadium and sports complex. The association also welcomes the fact that this stadium can accommodate Gaelic games and anticipates that Gaelic games will be played in this stadium when constructed in the second half of this decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These policies and views represent the official agreed position of the association and <Col N="499" /> any other interpretation is at variance with the facts.</P>
    <P>I have heard various rumours regarding the cost of Sports Campus Ireland. Some say the projected cost is too high and others say it is too low. That will be a matter for the development company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultants' report states that in 15 stadia in other locations which were examined there was an average cost overrun of 73%. The initial projected cost of the national sports stadium was £281 million. There was a subsequent announcement that a 50 metre pool would be part of the complex. What is the cost of this pool in addition to the initial £281 million? Is it correct to assume the project will cost more than £500 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In their report the consultants estimated the cost at £281 million. This does not include the cost of a 50 metre swimming pool which has now become a priority with the Special Olympic Games due to held here in 2003. It has been proposed that we should build a swimming pool of international standard through the provision of diving facilities. A private investor has indicated that they would be willing to support the provision of such facilities. It is now a matter for the development company which will assess the cost on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Minister last meet the FAI to discuss the matter? Is he disappointed at its reaction and are relations strained as a result? How can he be confident about obtaining planning permission given that permission has been refused for major shopping centres on the periphery on the grounds that they would cause traffic congestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is confident that the project will be viable. Aside from the swimming pool element has the Minister or the Taoiseach invited or received any offers of investment from the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Relations between the Government and the FAI are not strained. The Taoiseach and I continue to attend and be invited to functions. There are disagreements and differences of opinion but we agree to disagree. The FAI is entitled to continue with its own stadium. I have not met the association nor has it requested a meeting with me since it met the Taoiseach recently at which time it outlined that it was prepared to go it alone. I have been asked <Col N="500" /> if people living in the area have been consulted about the stadium. They will be able to voice through the planning process any objections they may have which will be considered in the first instance by the local authorities and ultimately An Bord Pleanála. The only offer of private investment has been received from Mr. J. P. McManus of £50 million. There is a possibility of a smaller but welcome sum for the provision of swimming pool facilities. Sporting organisations have a unique opportunity to avail of the stadium for major international events and as a consequence directly fund their constituent members. I am confident that the project will be viable.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that his Department and the Department of Finance are putting the cart before the horse?

      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 51, after &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and with groups representing those expected to appear before the Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the proposed scheme to be made by the Minister for the payment of expenses of witnesses appearing before the commission and those making their case to it. The amendment provides that the Minister would consult not just the commission but groups representing those expected to appear before the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable concern has been expressed, particularly by those who are appearing as survivors of child abuse, about whether they will be adequately supported in making their cases. Some of the concerns expressed have been about quite mundane matters, such as whether they would receive the cost of travel tickets in advance or would have to wait long periods before they <Col N="513" /> were reimbursed. Such issues need to be resolved in the implementation of the scheme, which is why it would be useful to have consultation with those likely to appear before the commission.</P>
    <P>There is also the wider issue of legal representation. I know the Minister is correctly trying to avoid the commission becoming extremely legalistic, as we have seen happen in some other cases. On the other hand, the legal representation proposed by the Minister is very flawed. The proposal is that individuals appearing before the commission as survivors of child abuse could claim legal expenses only if they could show they could not afford to pay their own legal expenses and, even then, only to a maximum figure of £800 for their whole appearance.</P>
    <P>Someone taking a case to the investigation committee, who will be subjected to hostile cross-examination, deserves and would expect proper legal representation. That should not be capped arbitrarily in the way proposed here. No such cap will be applied to the legal expenses of accused persons appearing before the commission. Their expenses will be paid for by the State, which is as it should be. However, I do not see why discriminatory rules should be established for the presentation of cases by survivors of child abuse. If we want to avoid excessively legalistic procedures, that is a matter for Ms Justice Laffoy. We should not seek to arbitrarily impose a cost cap in the way that is being done in the draft scheme.</P>
    <P>Consultation is important. The representatives of survivors of child abuse are entitled to have some form of representation throughout the whole procedure. The draft scheme provides that only individuals making their own specific cases can receive some legal representation, which is capped at £800. There will be no continuing legal representation for survivors which would follow their interests throughout the entire commission process and ensure they are adequately represented in the many public sessions.</P>
    <P>That is the thinking behind the amendment. There are unresolved issues. It is very important that, when the Taoiseach has made a full apology, we should also be in full support of those who wish to bring their case before the commission, so that the truth of what occurred can be properly acknowledged and dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 53. I will put a couple of questions to the Minister, the answers to which I hope will address the reasons I think this amendment is of extreme importance. I wish to make specific reference to a group of victims which may not attend because of the Bill's shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> Because of the speed at which all Stages of the Bill are proceeding through the House there is not an opportunity for adequate consultation and public debate on this matter. I understand Report and Final Stages will conclude today, and the Bill will go to the Seanad tomorrow and be completed there in a matter of days. Although it is important, this is not emergency legislation. It is vital that the important matters are teased out and debated adequately, which unfortunately the speed at which we are proceeding does not allow.</P>
    <P>As far as this amendment is concerned, I want to speak about the victims of a teacher in my constituency who is now in prison, Mr. Donal Dunne, who taught in five schools, mostly in my constituency, from the 1940s to the 1990s. His many victims will not attend the commission unless the Minister takes certain action and is prepared to accept appropriate amendments, one of which we are now debating. This group must have continuous legal representation equal to that accorded to other parties because without such representation there is little role or function for these victims. They may be told by the Minister they will have an opportunity to tell their stories but they have already done that in court. It is important that the Minister would allow the legal representatives of the victims of Mr. Donal Dunne and others to have full access to all documentation and records, and that the commission's report will include reference to findings in individual cases. It is essential that victims receive that acknowledgement. My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated on Second Stage, and argued vociferously on Committee Stage, that without such individual findings these people would have no reason to attend and queried the benefit of such a commission unless there is a section in the report on individual findings. That can happen only if the commission's work is done where there are continuous representations on behalf of all persons expected to appear before it. This is fundamental to the Bill and it is why Deputy Bruton tabled the amendment. These are important issues not only for the victims involved in the case to which I referred but for the adequate and proper working of the commission. I hope that between now and the end of the debate the Minister will confirm that there will be a separate report with findings and recommendations specific to primary and secondary schools, where individual teachers, such as Mr. Donal Dunne, taught for many years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Minister's colleague and predecessor, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, refused to go along with the concept of a separate report. I am not sure why the commission should not be given instructions to divide the report into sections, and that these sections would include the important section to which I referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Flanagan. The speed at which the Bill has been dealt with is a matter of concern for many of the groups involved which intend to appear before the com<Col N="515" /> mission. While Members have access to records and the reports from the various Stages of the Bill, other people outside do not have the same kind of access. There is concern that interested groups and individuals have not had an opportunity to read through one Stage before the next Stage is taken. That was badly handled from the start in regard to this Bill. It is unfortunate that the needs and concerns of the various groups have been overlooked.</P>
      <P>I also support the points made regarding the victims of Mr. Donal Dunne. The manner in which they have been treated by the Minister's predecessor and the Department is regrettable. It is regrettable that they may not be able to co-operate with, or become involved in, the work of the commission. There are serious issues arising from this case, not least the manner in which this case was dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the manner in which complaints were dealt with in the Department of Education and Science, and those points were made strongly by my colleague, Deputy Higgins, and others on Committee Stage. The House's attention was drawn to the Bill's shortcomings and its failure to provide for a proper investigation of the manner in which complaints of abuse were handled by Departments. There is a pertinent point regarding the victims of Mr. Donal Dunne.</P>
      <P>It does not make sense that the Minister refuses to ensure the final report will be in sections dealing with different institutions or individual cases. The commission's remit is extraordinarily wide. If it is to have any meaning or long-term effect on services for children and the way the systems are organised, it is essential that the final report is in different sections. It is vital, for the sake of order and effectiveness, that the commission approaches this on an institution by institution or case by case basis. For that reason, there should be sections or chapters dealing with different institutions or different cases, and dealing with the role of the Department of Education and Science regarding what happened in the primary and secondary school sectors. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The schemes I have published in respect of expenses are drafts only since the Bill <Col N="516" /> requires consultation with the commission. I also have no objection in principle to consulting groups which represent witnesses, whether these witnesses are making allegations or are people against whom allegations are made. I and officials of my Department have already had such meetings and I or my officials will meet any group which requests it.</P>
      <P>That said, I do not propose to accept this amendment since, given the wide range of groups and sub-groups concerned, the position is too unclear to provide a precise statutory provision. Again I undertake that I or officials of my Department will meet with groups who want to give their views on this or any aspect of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Earlier we discussed at reasonable length the question of groups having representation and I am prepared to look at this issue. Accepting that the commission will be the investigating authority and will have all the powers and legal assistance necessary to investigate and follow-up any accusations, we recognise that there could be need for some representation for victims and that victims might like to come together in a group &ndash; I know some are working in groups &ndash; and we will examine this from the point of view of having a group or team representation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the speed at which the legislation is being processed, it is very important to realise that it is a matter of urgency for those involved. I am being pressed to get on with processing the Bill. Also, the commission is anxious to get on with the statutory process. The Bill was published on 2 February and it has gone through the different Stages since then. It is now mid-April and the Bill has been discussed extensively on Committee Stage. Anyone who wanted to comment on Second Stage was free to do so, and there were extensive contributions at that time.</P>
      <P>Regarding access to records, they are being made available and that process is already under way. There are 40,000 records which are being made available on the basis of full access for the purposes of the commission.</P>
      <P>The issue of the report including references to findings in individual cases was raised. The report will include instances where the Department was remiss and abusers and institutions will be named. If it is found, for example, that X was abused by Y, it will be possible to say that Y was an abuser and it can be said separately that X was abused. However, to say X was abused by Y would be a matter for subsequent development, be it by way of a compensation tribunal or through the courts.</P>
      <P>I will refer the case of Donal Dunne specifically to the commission together with all the departmental records. The benefit for the victims of Donal Dunne is that at last the responsibility of managerial and regulatory authorities can and will be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>People will be pleased that there can be findings of fact in relation to an indi<Col N="517" /> vidual who appears as a witness and who is a survivor of abuse. Certainly, at this late stage it is news that the Minister is indicating the commission can make such findings. In earlier discussions when the Minister pointed to the provision in section 13(2)(<i>c</i>), namely, that the commission would not make findings in relation to particular instances of alleged abuse of children, I was left with the impression that this ruled out the possibility of making positive findings that an individual suffered abuse. That is a step forward and will make it more worthwhile for people to appear before the commission. Previously, while a person might be identified as an abuser, an abused person was not vindicated in terms of their individual experience. I presume that the commission will largely communicate in private with people who appear before it in this respect.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the indication by the Minister that he is willing to meet representatives and agree to fund some form of group representation. I do not like the term &ldquo;look at&rdquo;. One can look from a great distance, and the Minister should indicate he is willing to give some form of legal representation to groups representing survivors of child abuse. I know the Minister will have a problem in terms of which groups are represented and how this will be done, but I think that can be resolved. The Minister should be up front and say, before the House concludes its consideration of the Bill, that there will be some form of group representation which will provide continuity in terms of the interests of survivors.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputies Flanagan and Shortall the Minister said he is being pressed to process the legislation. I am the Opposition spokesperson and have not received any suggestion that there is a need to rush the Bill from either side which will be represented, namely, survivors of institutions which provided care. I detect absolutely no pressure from outside the House in terms of processing the Bill. The pressure has come from the Department which wants to get the legislation through quickly. This may well be admirable &ndash; I can understand the enthusiasm &ndash; but like Deputies Shortall and Flanagan I have sympathy with those who, without legal advice, are seeking to track the legislation through the House. They have had the difficulty of reports from Committee Stage not being available when the debate on Report Stage began, and it is difficult for them to make submissions in response to Committee Stage to inform our discussions.

      <P>In page 15, lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;, or in any civil proceedings in a court or other tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provisions for the establishment of the commission are different to those in legislation to establish tribunals. The evidence provided to a tribunal is not admissible in a criminal case but legislation does not provide that such evidence is not admissible in a civil case. Survivors of abuse are anxious that evidence unearthed by the commission should be admissible in civil cases. The Minister might say the accused might be concerned that it should be admissible but if a commission is set up to establish the facts evidence should at least be admissible in civil actions subsequently where the issue of damages will be resolved so that survivors will not have to seek to re-establish the evidence gathered by the commission but without its support. The only document they will have from the commission will be its final report but evidence which came to light or statements made will not be admissible.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have had to piece together evidence again in a well known case to pursue tax issues. The Revenue at least has the privilege of access to a huge range of documentation as of right and it can put together such a case again. I doubt that the same would apply to an individual, perhaps on a low income, who would seek to take a civil action subsequent to the conclusion of the commission. Why does the Government feel it necessary to debar the use of evidence, statements, findings and every other aspect of the commission's work that is available? Why can these not be resubmitted in a civil action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 contains a number of provisions relating to the giving of evidence to the commission or to committees. A person will not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or hand over a document to the investigation committee on the ground that the answer or the document might incriminate him or her. This is a significant power for the committee. However, it must be recognised that in law a person has certain rights against self-incrimination. Accordingly, section 21(2) balances the power of the committee to receive statements and documents. This provides that a statement or admission made before the commission or a committee to a person taking evidence abroad, to an inquiry officer or in a document prepared for any of these bodies or people, will not be admissible against the person making it or his or her employer. Non-admissibility applies to criminal and civil matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment proposes to remove the civil matters from this provision. These provisions are aimed at encouraging maximum co-operation with the commission's investigating functions and provide a balance between ensuring that the committee can receive the information it needs and the constitutional rights of others. If the amendment is made it would endanger such co-operation and disturb the balance which has been achieved. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment. The Deputy is right that the report of the commission will be available and could be used. Any documentation provided to individuals, for instance, by my Department would be for their own use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is far from convincing. Just because he says it disturbs the balance, is the House expected to believe that is so? It sounds like the Red Queen. It is up to the Legislature to strike the appropriate balance. It seems that is not the case for people who have summoned the courage and gone through the difficult experience of attending an investigative committee, undergoing cross-examination, having the facts discovered, in so far as the commission will be able to establish them, and listening to statements by others involved. They should at least have access to that material when seeking damages in court subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why such a balance is inappropriately struck. As the Minister said, some people might not want to come forward in the knowledge that any statement could subsequently be used in civil actions but, on the other hand, we are trying to assist survivors of abuse to get to the truth and ensure a fair and reasonable outcome following their suffering. The balance should be slightly altered so that those who have had such experiences can use statements made to the commission as evidence in their subsequent civil actions. The Minister may say that agreement on a tribunal of compensation where negligence would not have to be proved in each case in an adversarial fashion might well get us over some of these problems. As the Minister will be the <Col N="521" /> first to admit, the Government is not yet in a position to put forward proposals for such a procedure.</P>
    <P>Many people will go through a very traumatic experience. Where there is physical abuse they will not be able to overcome the problems presented by the statute of limitations and this will further handicap them if they want to take a civil action. I am not a lawyer but I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that this amendment would disturb the balance of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The present wildlife legislation dates from 1976. Now, 23 years later, this Bill has been introduced to the House and, in general, I support its principles. All parties have as a common objective the protection of our flora and fauna and the preservation of our natural heritage.</P>
      <P>There are major problems which this Bill must address and when it goes to committee we will have great fun. I recall the late Deputy Noel Lemass, when he was in Opposition, asking my late father, who was dealing with the Board of Works which had responsibility for Dúchas, all these wonderful questions about the Latin names of insects or bird migrations.</P>
      <P>Today we can see the first signs of spring and the countryside looks very well. The rains of last year are draining away. The extent of hedge cutting which has taken place, however, is clearly visible. The Bill proposes that hedge cutting or the disturbance of hedgerows would be prohibited from 1 April until August &ndash; the critical nesting period. In some counties extensive hedge cutting has been carried out and is still being carried out now. Have the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Dúchas issued instructions to all local authorities that this should not take place until the end of the critical period? There is a law there from 15 April and that should be adhered to and monitored. When one talks to people involved in wildlife and those who are specialists in the field, they will say the hedgerows of Ireland are corridors of life for insects, birds and mammals and they provide cover, food and domestic habitats for many of these animals. In Britain, there is a very strict hedgerows Act, as the Minister knows, and elements of that could be incorporated into our wildlife Bill. Obviously, with the considerable development taking place all over the country in building and in construction, things will never be the same on a range of fronts.</P>
      <P>When I was a child growing up in the country the way of life was much more simple and mechanisation, fertilisation and agricultural output were not what they are now. That has changed forever. The introduction of the REP scheme has given an opportunity to preserve a way of life or certainly elements of what used to be around. Farmers are very willing assistants in this and are happy to be involved in the REP scheme. It is a source of income for them and is an easier way of life in what has become a very competitive sector. While there has been considerable progress in the economy, the REP scheme has been widely availed of and it offers a significant opportunity to preserve the principles of the Bill in various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One will have read in the national newspapers in recent days that the Government is about to consider the massive development in Dublin and deal with the traffic problems there. Given residents of this city and its environs can expect serious traffic jams for the next 15 years because of the billions of pounds which will be spent on <Col N="524" /> infrastructure, one can understand the frustration which will set in. When one considers that part of the national plan, which is very important, is to construct motorways from Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Galway and to other places yet to be determined and to carry out major road developments on national secondary and regional routes, one can see the problems which the Minister and the country face. On the one hand, it is necessary that we, as a modern economy and a young nation, do these things to keep abreast with developments in the foremost areas of Europe while, on the other hand, this is serious legislation which needs to be implemented properly.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the controversy which arose in Pollardstown Fenn in County Kildare, the only one of its kind in the country, the original proposal by the National Roads Authority was to effect a leakage of about 1.1 million gallons from the Fenn on a daily basis. This gave rise to serious concerns about habitat and wildlife in the Fenn. There is now a proposal, a compromise solution by the National Roads Authority, to seal the Fenn. It leads one to believe that if the National Roads Authority is serious about pushing on with these major developments, the Minister's Department &ndash; I will support her on this &ndash; should have a full opportunity to carry out proper assessments on the consequences of roads without holding them up. The Department should be allowed to appoint sufficient staff to ensure archaeological and heritage remains are properly analysed, preserved and excavated where necessary. These are fundamentally important issues.</P>
    <P>When one looks at what happened with the pipeline from Kinsale to Dublin, which was much narrower in extent than the proposed motorways, thousands of artefacts and archaeological remains were uncovered during those excavations. This will be multiplied thousands of times over by international contractors who will have a free rein to establish and close down quarries, where necessary, for fill or infill or excavation, as the case may be. As I said, I will support the Minister in arriving at a position where she has sufficient staff to carry out proper pre-planning, in sorting out the licence system and in carrying out analyses before these major developments take place. We do not want to see issues arising on a weekly basis when this starts like at Pollardstown Fenn where animal and insects of which I have never heard would disappear forever and which are important for those who are specialists in the area.</P>
    <P>Since the TB eradication scheme began about 25,000 badgers have been taken out. I have listened to radio programmes, seen some television programmes and have read a large number of reports on the badger. I remain unconvinced as to whether the badger is deemed scientifically to be the carrier of bovine tuberculosis. As Minister responsible for wildlife, she should make a clear statement on what is the best scientific analysis available. Is this a smokescreen or is there val<Col N="525" /> idity in the experiments conducted? Some of the reports would indicate that a majority of the badgers analysed or examined were not carrying bovine tuberculosis while others would suggest that a significant majority were. I am not a scientist and I do not know the answer to the question. This experiment has been ongoing for some time and TB is still as prevalent, if not more prevalent in some parts of the country, as it always was. That is an issue we need to clear up once and for all as far as we can.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for a broad education policy, although perhaps that is the wrong term; there is need for information to be conveyed to people living in rural Ireland who are resident in special areas of conservation, in national heritage areas or in areas deemed to be important in a wildlife sense. When one looks at the directives issued from Europe, some of the changes are completely anathema to what used to happen. One needs the consent of the Minister of the day to operate sailing schools, diving tours, use of the soil or seabed for any activity, fishing by any types of nets, construction of fences, buildings or embankments, the killing of ivy and the grazing by livestock treated the previous week with pesticide. There are regulations laid down by various European directives most of which people have never heard. They are very detailed and include the burning of vegetation, reclamation, infilling, ploughing or land drainage.</P>
    <P>The Government publishes White Papers saying it wants to populate rural Ireland, introduces the REP scheme to allow for the preservation of land in its former sense and we invite people to return from Australia, Newfoundland and other places to live in Ireland. When people decide to return to Ireland they get turned down left, right and centre for planning permissions which is a contradiction in terms of the Government White Paper. If a couple come back from America with three or four children who are sent to the local school, they may not want to live in the house their parents occupied as it might be very old and not suitable for their needs. However, because of planning restrictions, their application is turned down. Maybe they did not have pre-planning discussions but incidents of planning refusals are rising at an alarming rate in many counties. Common sense is one thing but the ability to live and rear one's family in rural Ireland is becoming very difficult. I do not mean there should be houses on every hill or promontory but there are times when refusals seem to be at the whim of a planner. There is a contradiction between what the Minister is responsible for &ndash; rural Ireland in its widest sense and wildlife &ndash; and what is in the Government White Paper which says we must keep rural small-town Ireland alive.</P>
    <P>In my home parish many years ago I was a founder member of a gun club which was set up to prevent indiscriminate shooting by foreign shooters who used to come here and shoot everything in sight. While the experiment of raising pheasants in captivity was not a great success, it <Col N="526" /> had value. I am glad the Minister is changing the regulations and streamlining the operation of shooters who come here because this has been a source of great contention among gun clubs, among legitimate holders of licensed shotguns or rifles. There were anomalies whereby one could use the same licence repeatedly and move to any part of the country without people's knowledge. In some cases dubious characters came in from abroad. I am glad that is being streamlined. I look forward to teasing out the details on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with section 51 of the amendment Bill of 1999, which was a cause of grave concern to those involved in hunting with hounds, falcons and so on. Very little correspondence has been received about other elements of the Bill. People seem to be aware of its existence but they are not quite happy with its implementation in practice. Some people may be unhappy that it is being too well implemented in some cases. The Minister's announcement that she will deal with the issue of hunting with hounds, falcons, hawks or whatever seems to have dissipated the head of steam that was building up in respect of the Occupiers Liability Act which was a cause of great concern.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wildlife Trust, which is a non-governmental conservation organisation and a registered charity, sent in a fairly detailed submission to the Department in relation to the amendment Bill of 1999. It suggested changes in a whole range of areas with which we can deal on Committee Stage &ndash; planning permission, compensation for compulsory acquisition, profits through illegal works and various other procedural changes. It also made the case that there should be no blanket exemptions for agriculture, forestry or construction works in relation to hedgerow removal during the critical period I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The argument with blood sports and anti-blood sports representatives will probably come to a head in the context of the snaring of hares and other animals. They will make their case fairly vociferously when we get to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Despite all the indications to the contrary, there appears to be a huge increase in the number of foxes around the country. No less than three weeks ago I was astounded to see one on Merrion Square, heading towards Mount Street. Where it was headed, whether to Fianna Fáil headquarters or Fine Gael headquarters, I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it was a mongrel fox. I am not too sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People involved in Coillte Teoranta say that where we used to have huge areas of forestry &ndash; up to five or ten thousand acres in some places in the west &ndash; foxes used to breed but because of the lack of food in them now, they have moved elsewhere. There appears to be a huge increase in the population of foxes on the fringes of towns and smaller villages. I do not know what the cur<Col N="527" /> rent situation is in terms of them being declared to be vermin. There used also be a bounty for grey crows, which was taken up by many gun clubs. That led in some instances to strychnine being placed in the wrong place, resulting in the deaths of children's pets from eating poisoned bait.</P>
    <P>This is a major Bill. I support its principles. I would like the Minister to be given the resources necessary to implement the legislation. I would not like to go through the process of a Second Stage debate and a fairly involved discussion on Committee Stage only to find at the end of it all that fine legislation has been put on the Statute Book but that nobody gives two damns about it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister gets the necessary resources to enable the Bill to be implemented. I look forward to Committee Stage because there are some very interesting concepts in this Bill and some interesting angles to be explored. I hope that, with the resources we have on the Opposition side consisting of the various cases that have been made to us and the expertise the Minister has available to her, we can put the best legislation possible on the Statute Book, because what is passed now in respect of wildlife will probably have to carry us through the next 50 years. Given the building up of the environment in terms of construction and economic expansion, this legislation is critical.</P>

Dar ndóigh, beidh díospóireacht againn ar Chéim an Coiste agus beimid ag iarraidh cabhrú leis an Aire feabhas a chur ar an mBille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as someone who comes from an urban area but who had many relations in the countryside and spent a good deal of my childhood there. In addition, I was a pigeon fancier and always had a great interest in birds. One great regret I have in relation to the bird population in my area is that although it is not very long ago that the little tern used to nest on the strand at Tramore and rear her young there, that is no longer possible since the area became popular for exercising dogs and so on. There were fields close to where I lived in Waterford city where now there are houses, and I can remember the fields being absolutely covered with golden plover. I see very few golden plover nowadays. There are all sorts of reasons different species disappear or have their numbers dramatically reduced. The food chain and all the elements of it are very important in that regard. Protecting our wildlife, our flora and fauna is important because tá siad fite fuaite lena chéile, as we would say in Irish. They are all interlinked, <Col N="528" /> and if links in that chain are lost, it has a huge impact.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that fascinates me is the change in habits of animals. Deputy Kenny referred to seeing a fox in Merrion Square. When in town for Dáil sittings, I used to stay in Northumberland Road. One night when I parked the car, what I thought was a dog walked past me, and suddenly I realised it was a fox. It walked down the bank of the canal. Obviously its den was close by. There are quite a few dogs in the area but the fox seems to have survived. I have noticed in my own area that foxes come much closer to urban areas.</P>
    <P>There is an important colony of kittiwakes that nest in the cliffs in Dunmore East harbour. One of the locals told me that years ago they would leave in September and would not return until the spring but now they leave in September and return six weeks later. Whether that has to with global warming or changed eating habits I do not know. As our landfill tipheads multiply and get larger we see seagulls feeding there. It is difficult to keep abreast of these changes and introduce measures to protect our flora, fauna and wildlife.</P>
    <P>I hope at the end of Second Stage the Minister will reply to my comments. We can debate them in greater detail when the Bill is referred to the Select Committee. The Minister said the Bill had a long gestation and that is true. It is important legislation. However, I cannot understand why the Wildlife Bill, 1999 and the Wildlife Act, 1976 as amended by regulations in 1985 are not being consolidated as is the case with the l999 Bill on planning. I have had difficulty moving backwards and forwards between the references in this amending Bill and the primary Act. There are references to 12 Acts including the Wildlife Act. I do not say this just in relation to this Bill but as a general practice, greater effort should be made to consolidate legislation. It would be of benefit not only to those who implement the legislation but more particularly to those who want to study these important Acts. The Minister should see if it is possible to do so even at this late stage. Obviously there is a great deal of work involved.</P>
    <P>Much of the terminology used in the Bill is the customary legal jargon but I remain to be convinced that it is necessary. The parliamentary draftsman should look at the terminology used with a view to reducing the number of words in phrases and sentences and making the legislation more readily understandable to the person in the street. The Minister should examine this issue. I realise it has taken a long time to put the Bill in place and to cover all the areas as comprehensively as the Minister has, but in terms of knowledge and understanding of the framework that exists, consolidation of the legislation would be a positive step.</P>
    <P>We should have an extension of the interpretation Act. There are certain concepts and descriptions that recur in legislation. If these could be in one Bill we would be doing the nation a service. Possibly we would reduce the income of the legal <Col N="529" /> profession but legislation is there to serve the people and that must be our first objective.</P>
    <P>The Bill is technical and complex. One criticism made to me is the absence of any reference to sustainable development. That should be defined in the interpretation section and should occur in all the appropriate places in the Bill. Whether it is dealing with statutory protection of natural heritage areas or generally strengthening the provisions for wildlife species and their habitats or enhancing the existing controls in respect of hunting or regulating the activities of commercial shoot operators or ensuring and strengthening compliance with international agreements, sustainable development must be a key concept.</P>
    <P>As regards the food chain, with NHAs there is need for a comprehensive approach and a full analysis of all the components of the food chain within a particular NHA or area of conservation. None of us can stress too much the importance of all elements of the food chain being protected.</P>
    <P>Section 46, line 46, begins with a definition of what habitats include. It has been put to me that subsection (<i>c</i>) which states: &ldquo;A specific locality where a particular fossil, mineral, geological or geomorphological feature is to be found&rdquo;  is not a habitat. &ldquo;Habitat&rdquo; is a term usually applied to living systems. It is essentially where birds, animals or whatever life form live or exist. At the end of the day, that definition of habitat is very much in relation to inanimate objects. By definition, a habitat is a place where there is some form of living creature, organisms or whatever. I ask the Minister to examine that issue and, if possible, to respond at the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the acquisition of land and rights by agreement. There is an issue here that I ask the Minister to address. The Bill provides only for the acquisition of lands by agreement. Obviously this is the preferred route and we would like to see this agenda moved forward by agreement. However, local authorities have compulsory acquisition powers as regards road development. There can be rare cases where a natural heritage area of outstanding merit cannot be acquired by agreement and its value to the State could be so great that compulsory acquisition would be appropriate. The use of such powers would have to be applied sparingly but their absence is a weakness in the Bill. There will be occasions when agreement is impossible and it will not be possible to acquire a particular natural heritage area. The Bill should address that issue.</P>
    <P>Section 15 contains the definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo; for the purpose of natural heritage areas. It includes any activity which destroys or significantly alters, damages or interferes with the integrity of any site or any of its species, communities or habitats. A definition which has been suggested to me as being superior, which I put to the Minister for her perusal, is an activity which is unsustainable and could lead to the loss of the site or any part of it, or any of its species in the short or long-term. What I am seeking is a definition that takes a <Col N="530" /> more comprehensive view of what &ldquo;works&rdquo; entails. Compensation should only be available in respect of activities which have begun at the time the Bill is enacted and not future activities. The Bill is weak in this regard. Otherwise, An Taisce contend that a landowner can claim State money to compensate for the refusal of a development which he or she had no real intention of carrying out. Once a site has been notified but before final designation takes place, there should be a moratorium on development at the site without permission or licence. There should not be compensation for unsustainable development in respect of natural heritage areas. I ask the Minister to review this section.</P>
    <P>That section 16 does not provide for conservation NGOs to be consulted in regard to natural heritage area designation is a matter of concern. The point has been made to me that a number of conservation NGOs should have a status in relation to the Wildlife Acts similar to that of An Taisce in relation to the planning Acts. In respect of natural heritage areas, interested parties other than landowners should have the means by which to suggest sites. It has been further suggested that NGOs should have the statutory right to propose sites for consideration as natural heritage areas. I would appreciate the Minister's views on whether NGOs in the conservation area, the wildlife area and so on should have a status similar to that of An Taisce in relation to the planning Acts and whether the public at large and wildlife would benefit.</P>
    <P>On the question of the designation of sites, only landowners or the Minister have powers in that area. Should there be an effective input in relation to identification and proposing of natural heritage areas by bodies other than the Minister's Department and the landowner involved? Another suggestion was that Dúchas should have a right of veto over all developments within natural heritage areas whether or not they are covered by the planning Acts. I have some sympathy with that line of argument. However there is another concern. If somebody in a local area is applying for planning permission and there is an SMR reference and a referral to Dúchas the person involved may be asked by Dúchas to carry out some excavation on the site and to employ an archaeologist approved by the Department. This is at a time when it is becoming more difficult for people to provide their own housing. This extra cost should not be borne in full by the applicant. When the excavation takes place and nothing shows up there is a loss of money. I would be concerned that a right of veto by Dúchas over all developments is too broad. However, I would like to see an enhanced role for Dúchas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with decisions not to make natural heritage area orders. This section needs to be strengthened so that the Minister's decision not to make a natural heritage order is presented in a transparent and scientifically justified way. If the Minister, for whatever reason, decides not to make the order it is important that justice is not <Col N="531" /> only done but that justice is seen to be done. When the Minister of the day decides against making a natural heritage area order there should be an onus on the Minister to provide a report which would be available to the public giving the scientific justification for not going ahead. This should be done in a transparent way. I want to avoid any allegation that there was a political motive in respect of any decisions taken by the Minister. If all the facts are available and can be inspected that situation will not arise. I am not suggesting the Minister would decide anything for a political motive &ndash; I know full well she would not. However, at a time when the credibility of politicians is not what we would desire there should be a mechanism to demonstrate that fairness had been applied and that justice was done.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a query about section 19(2) which reads:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is satisfied that the carrying out of the works are necessary for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, which interest may be of a social or economic nature, and, in the absence of an alternative and viable solution, the Minister may decide to give the owner, occupier or user consent to undertake the works.</P>
    <P>This is about carrying out works which the Minister believes must be carried out in the public interest. In the interpretations sections the words &ldquo;public interest of a social or economic nature&rdquo; should be more clearly defined. The Minister should explain more fully what this means. I have already mentioned the importance of transparency in the decision-making process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday in the course of my reply to an Adjournment debate in this House I said, in relation to the matter which is again before the House today, &ldquo;I fully accept that some serious issues have been raised in this case to which answers will be required&rdquo;. That was my view then and it is my view now. I also informed the House on Thursday that I had asked the President of the District Court to examine all the circumstances surrounding the issue of the liquor licence by Judge Donnchadh Ó Buachalla to Mrs. Catherine Nevin and I informed the House that the president had already been in contact with the Judicial Ethics Committee on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I had asked the Garda Commissioner for a report and that he had already initiated inquiries. I informed the House too that I had asked the chief executive of the Courts Service for a report on the case in so far as any court staff may have been involved. Finally I informed the House: &ldquo;For the sake of completeness, I should mention that my Department had for some time <Col N="532" /> been aware of concerns about the licensing issue referred to and I will deal with this also when I make my statement.&rdquo;  In order that the House can be fully appraised of the current state of play, I decided to come here this evening to advise it on where matters now stand. In particular, I want to inform the House of the action which is now proposed in an attempt to deal with important and complex matters satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that I received written reports from the Garda Commissioner and the chief executive of the Courts Service yesterday. In regard to the inquiry being conducted by the President of the District Court, the president, Judge Smithwick, wrote to the Secretary General of my Department yesterday and indicated that while he is conducting his inquiry at all possible speed it will, given the need for accuracy and fair play, take some time. I will return to this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>Before I say anything further about these reports and the actions I now propose to take, I want to put to rest some unhelpful and unfortunate suggestions which have been made to the effect that I have sought to conceal facts about this case and have sought to mislead this House. These allegations are so much at odds with the facts that all fair-minded commentators will see them for what they are, political gamesmanship, nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter of great regret if this House's consideration of the serious matter in hand is marked by a debate which is more concerned about political point scoring than getting at the truth of the issues which concern us all as parliamentarians and are of concern also to those we have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>Looking at the facts, it is quite evident that there was no attempt whatsoever to conceal anything. Without prompting from Deputies opposite or from anybody else, I told the House that my Department had information about this case and that I would deal with this when making a full statement on the matter. The open acknowledgement on my part that I had prior knowledge of at least some of the facts, coupled with an undertaking to provide the details in a more comprehensive statement when all the facts have been assembled, was and still is the proper way of ensuring that this House is fully appraised of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>It would be quite imprudent to attempt, in a statement made only a few days after the trial had concluded, to set out a full account of all the circumstances surrounding the issue of the pub licence in this very complex and controversial case. The dangers of saying things without being in possession of the facts will be apparent, for example, to Deputy Higgins who quite wrongly said that Judge Ó Buachalla had been struck off the Roll of Solicitors by the Law Society of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases like this it is inevitable that more information will come to hand than would be available to a Minister when making his or her preliminary statement. I understand that there are, for example, papers relating to the licensing matter in other offices &ndash; the Revenue Commissioners, the Chief State Solicitor's office, and the Attorney General's office. The critical point, as I emphasised earlier, is that I did not pretend or imply that my statement of Thursday last was other than a preliminary statement. Quite the contrary, I specifically said that my Department had more material and that I would come back to the House and deal with this in the context of a more comprehensive statement. That, to put it mildly, would be an extraordinarily unwise statement for any Minister to make if he or she had a grand plan of concealment in mind. The charge of concealment and of misleading the House, which was made in the mistaken belief that it would procure some political advantage, simply does not stand up. To avoid doubt on the matter, I do not pretend to have all the answers here and now that the House rightly seeks and I will not have them until all the very complex issues involved have been fully examined.</P>
      <P>Returning to the substantive issue, it will be apparent to Deputies that we are dealing here with a very serious matter in which the propriety of actions taken by a judge is an issue. There are certain requirements which are absolutely fundamental when matters are under examination which are so grave as to have potential implications for any individual's good name and-or his career. I summarised these requirements as follows on Thursday last:</P>
      <P>fair procedures require that the facts must be assembled, that the issues are put to the parties directly involved and that they be allowed time to respond. This is precisely what will happen in this case and is particularly relevant given the conflicting media reports which are emanating. To do anything else at this stage could jeopardise this process and I am sure that on all sides of the House, no one would wish this to happen.</P>
      <P>As to the exchange of correspondence in which my Department was engaged, to which I specifically referred in my statement last Thursday with the promise to provide more detail, this arose from letters received by and on behalf of members of the Nevin family. The correspondence from or on behalf of the Nevin family raised queries about the circumstances in which the licence transfer had taken place. At the heart of the questions raised were, first, whether it was lawful for the judge to act as he did and, second, whether in all circumstances the judge had acted with propriety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's initial letter of response contained the two essential points which are invariably made in cases involving judicial decisions or cases where legal advice is sought. The letter pointed out that the Judiciary is inde<Col N="534" /> pendent in the discharge of its responsibilities. This clearly applied as much to the issue of the licence by Judge Ó Buachalla as it did in any other case. The letter also stated that the Department does not provide legal advice and that it would be a matter for the person's lawyers to deal with that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>There was, however, further correspondence from the Nevin family and, simply to be helpful in the circumstances of this unusual case, my Department issued a further reply. For the purposes of preparing this reply, my Department contacted the Office of the Attorney General and was advised that counsel's opinion on this matter had been sought for the Garda by the Chief State Solicitor's office. A copy of that opinion was then obtained by my Department.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into detail on the legal aspects of this matter at this point nor do I propose to provide detail on the advice received from counsel, lest it be said that by doing so I am either favourably or unfavourably colouring Judge Ó Buachalla's actions in advance of the full examination of all the facts, which I believe to be essential and to which I shall shortly return.</P>
    <P>My Department did not become involved in correspondence about the second issue raised, that is, the propriety of the actions taken by the judge because it clearly would have been impossible to do anything of this kind without affording the judge the opportunity of commenting. To do that, as I indicated last week, would have required the kind of inquiry which could not be undertaken against the background of the major criminal trial which was about to take place because of the risk that it would be deemed prejudicial to have the bona fides of an important witness formally questioned when he was about to give evidence in the murder trial of the person who was also at the centre of the licensing issue.</P>
    <P>It would of course have been open to my Department to deal with the correspondence in question by simply sticking to the rigid and traditional line that the people in question should consult with their legal advisers. Although there is clearly merit in sticking to tradition, I do not regret that my Department tried to be as helpful as possible in the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>In summary, it is fundamental that Judge Ó Buachalla should now be afforded the opportunity of giving his side of the story and the opportunity of commenting on material to hand before I make any detailed statement on the legal or other aspects of this matter. It would have been quite wrong for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to initiate a process which would involve questioning Judge Ó Buachalla until the criminal trial had concluded. As to the further investigation of the propriety or otherwise of the actions taken by Judge Ó Buachalla, I am not at all satisfied, on the basis of the reports to hand, that it would be possible for anybody to draw a clear conclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> It is now quite apparent that this whole matter is much more complex than anybody, including myself, had perhaps anticipated originally. I can reveal to the House, for example, that in his letter dated 17 April to the Secretary General of my Department, the President of the District Court pointed out that the inquiry which he had been asked to undertake is:</P>
    <P>a very serious matter with grave implications. It must therefore be conducted strictly in accordance with fair procedures. It must also establish the facts accurately and not rely on guesswork or innuendo.</P>
    <P>The president went on to say that when he met Judge Ó Buachalla in connection with his inquiries, the judge was accompanied by senior counsel and that he &ndash; that is, Judge Smithwick &ndash; felt that he too would need to instruct a firm of solicitors as well as senior counsel. The only logical conclusion to draw from all this is that several issues will arise in the course of examining Judge Ó Buachalla's role in connection with the licensing of Jack White's Inn and these issues are far from straightforward. My own assessment at this point is that the complexities involved will not end with the matter of legality, propriety or otherwise of issues relating to the liquor licence.</P>
    <P>In recent times another matter of very serious import has been brought into the public domain in the public comments that have been made. There have been suggestions to the effect that two members of the Garda Síochána were treated in an unfair manner in Judge Ó Buachalla's court. This relates to allegations made some years ago against the two gardaí in question which were in the name of Mrs. Catherine Nevin. The suggestions made are to the effect that the two gardaí were subsequently treated less than fairly when they brought cases to Judge Ó Buachalla's court.</P>
    <P>There is a file in my Department on that issue which relates to the period when my predecessor was in office. As I see it, it will not be possible for the present investigation to be completed unless some of the matters raised at that time and which have again been brought into the public domain are looked at afresh because two of the names that were at the centre of the issues raised at that time were those of Catherine Nevin and Judge Ó Buachalla and the essential complaint was alleged impropriety on the part of Judge Ó Buachalla in the discharge of his judicial office. Nobody would consider the present investigation into the propriety of Judge Ó Buachalla's actions to be anywhere near complete unless the other very serious allegation of impropriety was also revisited in the light of all that is now known.</P>
    <P>What I have decided to do, therefore, with the approval of the Government, is to ask the Chief Justice in accordance with section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, to nominate a judge to conduct a formal statutory based inquiry into all aspects of this case. I have <Col N="536" /> already spoken to the Chief Justice in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Before I deal further with the mechanics of this inquiry it is important that I tell the House of my rationale for this approach. It is of the utmost importance that all the facts of this case are assembled at the earliest possible date consistent with the right of all parties to fair procedures and natural justice. The issue arises as to what course of action is most likely to achieve this objective. It seemed that the information conveyed by Judge Smithwick in his letter, particularly that in relation to the engaging of counsel, suggested that the possibility of an early report on his inquiry being supplied quickly was unlikely. There is no specific legal provision in place to underpin the type of inquiry being conducted by Judge Smithwick. Moreover the matter to which I referred regarding the allegations made while my predecessor was in office adds a new and important dimension to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Government is satisfied that the prudent and sensible course is to employ the specific legal provision which was put in place by the House to deal with the type of situation on hand, that is, a statutory inquiry. In deciding on this course of action in no way does it carry with it any imputation that I was unhappy with the approach adopted by Judge Smithwick as he embarked on his inquiry. I am happy to put on record that Judge Smithwick set about his difficult task with alacrity and had already held a meeting with Judge Ó Buachalla.</P>
    <P>The key issue &ndash; I am sure the House will agree &ndash; is that there is an absolute need to ensure no questions are raised about the powers and authority of the investigating judge. Given the nature of the issues in question, and bearing in mind the comments of Judge Smithwick to which I referred, the most appropriate course of action is to invoke section 21 of the 1946 Act which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister requests the Chief Justice to appoint a Judge to&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) investigate the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a Justice, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) to inquire into the conduct (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) of a Justice,  either generally or on a particular occasion, and, in either case, with particular reference to such matters as may be mentioned in the request, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say&ndash;</P>
    <P>(i) the Chief Justice shall appoint either a Judge of the Supreme Court or, with the consent of the President of the High Court, a Judge of the High Court to conduct the investigation or inquiry;</P>
    <P>(ii) the Judge so appointed may conduct the investigation or inquiry in such manner as he thinks proper, whether by examination of witnesses or otherwise, and in particular may conduct any proceedings <i>in <Col N="537" />camera</i>, and for this purpose shall have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in a Judge of the High Court on the occasion of an action;</P>
    <P>(iii) upon conclusion of the investigation or inquiry, the said Judge shall report the result thereof to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice has advised this afternoon that he has appointed the Honourable Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, judge of the Supreme Court, to conduct the inquiry. It will be noted that the provision states that the investigating judge shall have all the powers, rights and privileges as are vested in a judge of the High Court. That is the key factor as it will enable the investigating judge to call and question witnesses under oath, to seek papers and documents and so forth. In this regard my Department will be communicating with Mr. Justice Murphy to advise him of the papers held in the Department in relation to this matter. Moreover, it will also be open to Mr. Justice Murphy to seek any papers held in any other office which may have a bearing on this matter.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked if this inquiry will be held in public. In accordance with section 21 that is a matter for Mr. Justice Murphy and it would be wrong for me to suggest how he should conduct the business of the inquiry. It may also be asked if it is my intention to publish the reports in question. It is my firm intention to do so when the judge has reported to me. In the meantime clearly I cannot do so because such a step would be inimical to the interests of fair procedure and natural justice. With regard to Mr. Justice Murphy's remit, the terms of reference are being finalised by me in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>That is where the matter now stands. These are very serious matters and I have put in place the steps at my disposal to establish what happened in relation to the licensing issue and the other matter included in the terms of reference. The important thing is that we give the investigating judge the space in which to discharge his function. Above all else we must avoid saying anything which could cut across the absolute requirement to observe strictly the principles of natural justice and the maintenance of fair procedures. The House and the public we represent are entitled to have the matters raised fully and properly investigated without resort to prejudice, innuendo and other irrelevancies. That is the process I have set in motion and I will return to the House when I have a report that deals fully and fairly with the facts.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> In the Dáil last week in reply to questions raised by me on the Adjournment the Minister stated, &ldquo;For the sake of completeness, I should mention that my Department too had for some time been aware of concerns about the licensing issue referred to and I will deal with this also when I make my statement.&rdquo;  Far from achieving the so-called completeness to <Col N="538" /> which he referred the Minister deliberately withheld from the Dáil the fact that he had received correspondence from the family of the late Tom Nevin in which they queried and expressed serious concerns regarding the transfer of the licence from their late brother to his widow, Catherine Nevin.</P>
      <P>The Minister, through his private secretary, replied to Mr. Patsy Nevin on 19 April and 13 August 1999. In his reply of 13 August the Minister spelled out the chronology of events, the applications relating to Jack White's Inn, the dates of the various hearings and his interpretation of the law. All this information was relevant and should have been brought to the attention of the Dáil last Thursday. It was not. The Minister refrained from doing so.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that his Department was not going to become involved in the issue of propriety. Yet in his letter of 13 August he stated:</P>
      <P>These applications were made in accordance with the rules governing same. Due notice was given and they were all dealt with in open court.</P>
      <P>This information should have been provided in the Dáil last week. It was not. The Minister withheld it. Is he still satisfied that all the applications were made in accordance with the rules and that due notice was given in all cases? Is he still of the belief that the court was an open court and not a private sitting?</P>
      <P>The Minister admitted last Thursday that his Department had been aware of the concerns about the licensing issue for some time. He should have spelled out exactly what these concerns were. He should also have indicated the sources of these concerns. Presumably he had in his possession the covering report from Inspector Peter Finn from Gorey, dated 14 November 1997, to which I referred in the Dáil last week and which made it quite clear that notice was not given as required by law. Inspector Finn said, &ldquo;I was not on notice.&rdquo;  He also stated, &ldquo;This application was made in Chambers&rdquo;&ndash; a private court, a private sitting in the back room of a courthouse. He named the other four persons, other than the judge, who were present.</P>
      <P>I assume that another document the Minister had in his possession or was apprised of was the report on the proceedings, which he withheld from the Dáil, drawn up by Garda Superintendent J. P. Flynn in which he states:</P>
      <P>What transpired prior to the 19th of March 1996 and subsequent renewal of the existing licence for Jack White's Inn on the 29th of September 1997 has to be, in my submission, highly irregular, unlawful and without precedent in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to state that the statutory requirement for legalising the position which pertained to the existing publican's licence in respect of Jack White's premises after the murder on 19 March 1996 of Tom Nevin was totally ignored. <Col N="539" /> The requirement to make application to the District Court under statutory provisions to legalise the licence situation in respect of Jack White's licensed premises after 19 March was totally ignored. The statutory requirement to put the superintendent in charge of the court area of the Garda district where the premises is situated on required notice of any such application was not complied with. The application was incorrect and unlawful. He, therefore, said that incorrect procedures were used without foundations or legal justification in law.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clung to the defence that he could not conduct inquiries while the Catherine Nevin trial was in progress. That argument is untenable. There was nothing to prohibit the Minister conducting whatever inquiries were necessary. These inquiries would not have prejudiced the trial. Had they been conducted, the report of what exactly happened could have been available after the Nevin trial had been concluded. The Minister's delay in coming to grips with this issue has contributed in no small measure to the current state of uncertainty and delay. Every day that passes, public confidence in the judicial process, which is the cornerstone of the Constitution, is further undermined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is at issue here is the conduct of justice in our society and the belief by citizens that everybody is equal before the law and is treated equally when they come before a judge.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, enables the Minister to request the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to inquire into the conduct of a district judge whether in the execution of office or otherwise. For the purpose of the inquiry, the judge so appointed is given all the powers, rights and privileges of the High Court hearing a civil action. As far as I know, this section has not been invoked by a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That in itself is an indication of the seriousness of the matter with which we are now dealing.</P>
      <P>The immediately preceding section of the 1946 Act deals with the tenure of district court judges and confers on them the same rights of tenure as High Court and Supreme Court judges which they enjoy by virtue of the Constitution. Under that section, therefore, District Court judges are removable from office only for stated misbehaviour or incapacity on foot of resolutions passed by both the Dáil and the Seanad. The step just announced by the Minister, depending on the contents of the report furnished to him and then published by him and presented for consideration to this House, may become the first step in a process for the removal by the Houses of the Oireachtas of a judge from office on grounds of misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the gravity of this situation, the questions being asked of the Minister about his handling of the matter cannot be dismissed as Opposition backbiting. We know the Minister was <Col N="540" /> alerted more than a year ago to the concerns raised by the family of the late Tom Nevin about the validity of the procedures adopted by Judge Ó Buachalla. The Minister did not reply by saying either that he had no function in judicial matters, the usual response from his Department in such cases, or that it would be inappropriate to investigate until a forthcoming criminal trial was out of the way. Instead his private secretary replied on the Minister's behalf dealing with the substance of the Nevin family's complaint. The impression was strongly conveyed in so many words that the Minister and his Department were satisfied that appropriate statutory procedures had been complied with.</P>
    <P>If that was the Minister's view, what changed so that last week it was thought necessary to mount three separate inquiries involving the gardaí, the Courts Service and the District Court President, Judge Smithwick? How could the Minister have been so decisive in his reply to Patsy Nevin if further inquiries are now required? Was the Nevin family being fobbed off with a reply which was based on incomplete and inadequate inquiries? Whatever the reason, this House was entitled to be told last week of the Minister's previous involvement in considering and effectively adjudicating on the issues which a High Court is now being asked to examine afresh in a sworn inquiry. We are entitled to know to what extent the Minister was personally aware of or involved in the correspondence with the Nevin family.</P>
    <P>It is now reported that both the gardaí and the court staff were unhappy with the approach adopted by Judge Ó Buachalla. Judge Smithwick has yet to express a view on whether it was appropriate for the judge to consider this application in the first case, given the circumstances of his connection with the applicant. The Minister knows nothing from either the gardaí or the court staff which he could not have found out more than a year ago when this issue was first raised with him. There is no reality to the statement that such informal inquiries by him would have been inappropriate in view of a pending trial on a charge of murder. The Minister has yet to persuade me or the public that he has information in his possession today to justify this appointment which he could not have found out long ago if he had been handling the issue in an appropriate, timely and decisive manner.</P>
    <P>The current controversy has highlighted the urgent need once again for the introduction of a judicial code of ethics and the establishment of a judicial council to consider complaints of improper actions by members of the Judiciary. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its fourth report last November and recommended both these initiatives, but so far nothing has been done by the Government to bring them into effect. There is a need for procedures to deal with situations where judges may have acted improperly short of the steps provided in the 1946 Act or the even more extreme <Col N="541" /> measure of a vote for impeachment by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The independence of the Judiciary must be upheld but if the judicial system is to retain the confidence of the public, we need procedures to deal with legitimate complaints by the gardaí or the public where a judge may have acted in an improper manner. Early legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is now essential.</P>
    <P>The Sheedy case last year raised legitimate fears that all members of the public were not being treated equally before the law and that those who had access to members of the Judiciary were open to being treated in a more favourable manner. Unless we get answers to the questions which arise in this case and the appropriate action is taken, if warranted, when the report is available, this perception will be reinforced.</P>
    <P>Another matter which arises in this case is one for which the Minister has direct political responsibility. There is serious concern in Wicklow at the manner in which two members of the Garda Síochána have been treated. They made complaints to the Garda authorities about the manner in which Judge Ó Buachalla dealt with cases they brought before him. They have apparently been confined to desk duties for almost five years and their career prospects have suffered as a result. There is a need for the Minister to examine whether an injustice has been done to the two gardaí in question and, if so, to look at ways in which that damage can be undone.</P>

Did Inspector Finn attend a previous court sitting in Gorey where the issues surrounding the granting of this licence or related matters were discussed and was the case adjourned to Wexford? Was the fact the inspector realised the case had been adjourned to Wexford but he was not notified the only reason he turned up? Did the inspector or the court clerk in Wexford object to the manner in which proceedings were being carried out and, if so, did Judge Ó Buachalla adjourn the case from midday until early afternoon?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of whether a directive was issued to gardaí in Arklow in or around the mid-1990s instructing them to desist from visiting Jack White's in an official capacity? If this is so, on whose authority and on what basis was this instruction issued?</P>

        <b>:</b> When and by whom were the difficulties surrounding the validity of the licence transfer procedures first brought to the Minister's attention? The Minister's private secretary replied on his behalf to Patsy Nevin on 13 August. Before this reply was issued, did the Minister consult Inspector Finn or Superintendent Flynn as to what had transpired in court on the day the transfer order was made and, if he did not do so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it related to the licence but I recall concerns being raised with me about the Nevin case. I could not identify the precise nature of these concerns but in the back of my mind I recall a councillor from Galway raising the Nevin case with me when I was in Opposition. Of that I am relatively certain. I am also certain that at least one Deputy, Deputy Burke, raised the matter with me as a result of reports.</P>
      <P>As regards other people raising this matter, after I became Minister correspondence arrived in the Department for and on behalf of the Nevin family. As regards these queries, the genuine objective of the exercise was to try to be as helpful as I could possibly be to the Nevin family. I realised the trauma of all the events and was trying to ascertain whether we could be helpful to them in terms of what happened over the transfer of the licence. All we did was assemble facts from the District Court clerks and transfer those facts to a member of the family. That is as I recall events. There was no question at any time of my conducting any inquiry into the legality of the transfer. Certainly there was no question at any time of my conducting an inquiry into the propriety of the judge in question. I am not casting aspersions on him or on what happened when I say these things. I am genuinely saying that when I replied to the Nevin family through my private secretary, it was done out of a sense of trying to be helpful and there was no question of anything covert. That is the truth.</P>

        <b>:</b> In his letter to the Nevin family the Minister told them that correct procedures had been followed, that proper notification had been made and that the case was heard in open court. The Garda hotly disputes this as is obvious from Inspector Finn's report and the very trenchant report from Superintendent Flynn. Why did the Minister, his private secretary or the Department not contact the Garda for its version of events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told the House that the version of events as relayed by him to the Nevin family were elicited from the District Court clerks. What are the names of the clerks in question and did they confirm that correct procedures were followed? My understanding is that the District Court clerks, particularly Mr. Sexton in Arklow, <Col N="544" /> were seriously unhappy with the procedures and that was the reason the hearing was transferred from Arklow to Wexford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the two District Court clerks in question were Mr. Sexton and Mr. Cullen. The letter written to Patsy Nevin dated 19 April 1999 simply set out certain facts. It was in no way judgmental but set out certain facts as I had ascertained them. I did not seek the opinion of anyone as to the propriety of the judge's behaviour. I could not and would not do so because it was clear that this matter was going to travel onwards. It must be understood that if I had interfered in any way in this matter, it would have been open to defence counsel to raise this matter during the trial with consequences which I could not have foreseen then or could categorise now other than to be certain that it was a risk I should not take. If I had taken such a risk and had prejudiced the trial and the accused had been found not guilty, for example, or if the case had been withdrawn from the jury because of my interference, Members would correctly criticise me. That was a risk I could not take, nor could any Minister.</P>
      <P>As regards who the notice parties were, whether notice was given, who gave it or who should or should not have given it, without being in any way dismissive of Deputy Higgins's queries, neither I nor the Deputy is in a position to be definitive in terms of the High Court judge's conclusions. For what it is worth, I would advise the Deputy to await the High Court judge's conclusions before jumping to conclusions in this matter.</P>

      <P>It would be clear to me that it is a figment of his imagination. At no point did I tell the Nevin family that the procedure was proper. I outlined in detail the facts of the case as I understood them to be. Perhaps I would have been better off adopting the traditional line and stating that they would be better off asking somebody else. I did not do that; I tried to be helpful and I have no regrets about that. I outlined the facts of the case. The situation was as I outlined it and I cannot put it beyond that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of the barristers and the solicitors being interviewed and the issue of Inspector Finn, the position is that it would obviously be within the remit of the High Court judge to question all individuals involved in this particular matter. That is not something which would have been in the remit of any of the original inquirers.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that it would be possible to have a quick definitive inquiry from each of the people concerned, the chief executive of the Courts Service, the Garda Commissioner and the President of the District Court. Unfortunately, it transpired that this would not be the case. In any event, the probability is that there would have been conflict as between at least some of the reports or at least as between some of the people making contributions. In those circumstances, I might have ended up having to transfer the matter to a High Court judge anyway pursuant to the section of the 1946 Act. In those circumstances and to short-circuit the possibility of there being a long delay, I decided that the matter should now be transferred to a High Court judge. I did so also because he would have far greater powers than anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish a Shannon River statutory authority.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Naughten, Reynolds and McGrath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Fine Gael believes the best approach to the strategic management of the River Shannon is for the Government to establish an authority to oversee, co-ordinate and implement plans and policies which will assist each competing interest group to enhance its interest in a manner which will not be prejudicial to other users of this unique natural resource. This proposal has nothing to do with the drainage of the River Shannon but it has everything to do with the management of it. The motivation behind tabling this motion is to ensure that, after years of neglect, plans are put in place to maintain the River Shannon. A River Shannon statutory authority would have the necessary clout and authority to achieve the results which the existing River Shannon Forum does not have.</P>
    <P>I will be clear on the principles on which the proposed River Shannon authority would operate. Fine Gael wants to encourage more boating and fishing; to maintain the electricity generating capacity on the river; to control and eliminate possible pollution; to preserve wildlife; to co-operate with Waterways Ireland, the new all-Ireland organisation, to help the navigational potential; and to minimise the risk of flooding and the consequential loss of income for so many farmers and householders on its banks.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe it is possible to co-ordinate the various interests on the river in a way in which flooding can be controlled to some degree. Let us look at what has happened to the River Shannon over a period of many years. Every day millions of gallons of water cascade into the Shannon Basin bringing millions of tonnes of silt and debris. This vast tonnage has replaced water capacity in the river. Anybody who knows the River Shannon will have seen the many islands which have emerged over the years. These blockages have the effect of creating localised flooding along the River Shannon. I emphasise that this has nothing to do with either widening or deepening the river. It is a maintenance problem which must be addressed which has been allowed to go out of control in recent years.</P>
    <P>Farmers and householders living at certain flash points on the River Shannon know that the floods come quicker and cover more extended areas of farmland as each year goes by. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, knows that as well as I do. There are many householders and farmers living on the banks of the river who have cause for huge anxiety as every winter approaches. On the question of limited embankment projects on the River Shannon, years ago some parts of the river had their banks strengthened and raised to prevent local flooding with a reasonable degree of success. Over the years the banks generally have deteriorated. No agency has the authority to remove the debris even on the edge of the River Shannon. Nobody can even take a shovel full out of it. Consequently many such areas of the river are more prone to flooding and they are messy and unsightly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The question of tributaries of the River Shannon, other rivers which have become blocked and static, must also be addressed. The almost total withdrawal of the county councils from any meaningful maintenance on small rivers is causing anger and anxiety among farmers all over the country.</P>
    <P>There appears to be wide-ranging support for the statutory authority. At a well attended and successful joint meeting at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine held last January in the wake of the horrendous River Shannon flooding, which, incidentally, blocked major arterial roads, all of the interest groups indicated, under in depth questioning from Members from all sides of the House, that they would work within the context of a statutory authority and, as many of them put it, would do so in a positive manner as they had nothing to hide. However, what is now required is the political will to set up the River Shannon authority.</P>
    <P>Last January at a huge flood meeting organised by the IFA in Athlone it was evident that farmers and householders demanded greater action by the Government. Speaker after speaker outlined graphically the trauma which they were going through with their houses and lands flooded and the contents of their houses ruined, and many were finding it difficult to get insurance cover. Probably worst of all were reports that flood waters seem to be spreading out much further in the fields and were much deeper as every year went by.</P>
    <P>The Government's stance on this issue is difficult to fathom. The recent carry on of the Fianna Fáil Senators when they voted down the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, which, in essence, would have seen the establishment of a statutory authority, is terribly hard to understand. Two months ago I even heard one of that party's Senators, Senator Finneran, declare on local radio that it was with pleasure that he was backing this Bill and that he was the first Senator to put his shoulder to the wheel and get a Bill through the Seanad. About a week later, he voted against it. I find that difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The Bill which was voted down in the Seanad was, in essence, a Bill drawn up by Deputy Daly, and it was a good Bill. However, the Government gave frivolous reasons when it ordered its Senators to vote down the Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a Government amendment to the motion, that the matter will be referred to one of the Oireachtas committees. That side-step would do justice to one of the rugby internationals because the motion sought a straight answer from the Government. I wanted to find out whether the Government wanted a statutory authority. I live very close to the Shannon and know there are huge and very complex issues involved. Those who live on the banks of the river and those who use the Shannon would like to know the approach of the Government. <Col N="551" /> However, all they have got tonight is another side step of the issue.</P>
    <P>In effect this is the end of the idea of a statutory authority for the Shannon. All the Minister had to do was agree with the motion, the only purpose of which was to find out whether the Minister and the Government wanted a statutory authority. By virtue of the Government amendment to the motion, it is clear that it does not want a statutory authority. Otherwise the Government would not have tabled the amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Government agreed to the authority we could then get down to the serious business of its form, role etc. However, after all the talk by the Minister's colleagues, including some very senior colleagues who said they were personally in favour of an authority, we find the Government is doing the greatest side step of all time. It was evident from the debate in the Seanad that this is what the Government was going to do and I hope it will be seen for what it is. The Minister has given the thumbs down on the day every Deputy and Senator on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, and the ESB, Dúchas and the Office of Public Works said they believe a statutory authority would work. The Minister is now saying he will side step the issue and pass it over to one of the committees. It is outrageous carry on and it will be seen for what it is.</P>
    <P>The various committees and flood victims were given to understand in the heat of the moment that a statutory authority would be established, but when it comes down to it the Minister is failing these people.</P>
    <P>An exceptionally good Bill prepared by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, was not even allowed on the floor of the House for discussion because of the rules of the House. Given that neither the Fine Gael motion, which simply sought clarity on whether the Government wanted a statutory authority, nor Deputy Penrose's Bill, which was very specific in terms of how such an authority could be established, have been accepted, does it appear to the Minister that it will be several years before anything is done? We will listen to hear whether the Minister is in favour of a statutory authority.</P>
    <P>I have no problem whatever believing that the competing demands and interest groups can be accommodated in terms of the Shannon. At the same time the huge and ever-increasing problem of winter flooding along the banks of the Shannon can be alleviated through better management. The Government should make £10 million or £15 million available per year for maintenance along the banks of the Shannon. I am not talking about deepening or widening the Shannon because we have long passed that stage. However, if millions of tonnes of silt are pumped into the basin of the Shannon, water has to be displaced. If we are ever to get back to the stage <Col N="552" /> we were at 15 or 20 years ago we must maintain the river and silt must be removed.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister whom I thought supported a statutory authority. In fairness to him, when he gets something into his head he delivers on it, but he has either been over-ruled on this matter or does not believe in a statutory authority. I want the Minister to say whether he wants a statutory authority. I take it, given the amendment which has been submitted, that he does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for tabling this motion on the establishment of a Shannon authority, the reason for which is that the Government has been twisting and turning on the issue since it was first mooted at a public meeting in Athlone last January following the record flooding in the Shannon basin over the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>Draining the river has been an issue of debate for generations among people residing in the Shannon basin and was first given political credence by the late Brian Lenihan when he was a Deputy for County Roscommon. However, people are realistic and realise this proposal will never be implemented, but they rightly feel that some organisation should be responsible for the maintenance and control of the river. Proper management of the water level and maintenance of the channel would dramatically reduce the threat of serious flooding. Such a measure can only succeed through the establishment of a statutory Shannon authority which would supervise and regulate the myriad of bodies that are currently involved in one form or other in regulating or controlling this famous river.</P>
      <P>At a public meeting in Athlone the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, committed herself to the establishment of such a body, as did other public representatives present from both sides of the House. However, subsequent to this meeting the Government politicians backed down on this and other commitments to provide assistance to the people who had been directly affected by the flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions with them, my colleagues in the Seanad moved Second Stage of the Shannon River Council Bill, which Government Senators had already planned to vote down. However, the Government side eventually saw the light and accepted Second Stage, Committee Stage without amendment and Report Stage. However, they did a further U-turn and voted down the Bill on its Final Stage. This was an historic decision as it is the first time in the history of the State that a Government accepted the principle and contents of a Bill and then voted it down on Final Stage. To add insult to injury, it used two of the lamest excuses that I have ever heard, even a three year old would have concocted a better explanation. It claimed that the establishment of the cross-Border implementation group, Waterways Ireland, which will take over the role of Dúchas in relation to the navi<Col N="553" /> gation of the Shannon, and the proposed EU framework directive on water policy, which the Government claims is imminent, would ensure that the authority was not warranted.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally important in the context of this debate to correct both of these misleading statements. First, Waterways Ireland will have control of the River Shannon only in relation to navigation for the purposes of pleasure craft. It takes over this role from Dúchas. Dúchas stated at a recent Dáil committee:</P>
    <P>The role of the waterways service, now Waterways Ireland, in regard to the River Shannon is confined to navigation. In times of flood, the waterways service has no control over the water levels. None of the Acts which apply to navigation grant powers or impose duties relating to drainage matters or flood relief. Accordingly, Waterways Ireland will not be in a position to carry out any studies or works in relation to flood relief on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Second, the EU framework directive on water policy is a proposed directive, concentrating solely on water quality, and will take years to implement. Currently, there are a total of 116 EU directives which have yet to be implemented by Government, 46 of which have already passed their implementation date, leaving Ireland in breach of them. In terms of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which will have responsibility to implement this new directive, implementation of two water directives, which were formally passed by the EU in 1976 and 1980, remains outstanding. Do the people in the Shannon basin have to wait 25 years to have such a proposed directive implemented?</P>
    <P>The draft directive states that member states shall comply with the provisions of the directive ten years after its entry into force. Extensions beyond this date are limited to two further periods of six years each for the river basin management plan. As the directive also incorporates the requirement for the reintroduction of water charges, implementation will not be a top priority of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government does not seem to realise that the water level at the Shannon weir in Athlone reached the level similar to that which it reached in 1954 when the people in the Shannon basin experienced the worst floods on record, a disaster similar to that which occurred recently in Mozambique. On that occasion James Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, visited the flood victims to view the extent of the flooding and told his officials to treat the people with dignity and respect and to err on the side of generosity. Dillon gave clearance to the local authority, with the approval of the Government, to repeal any legislation or regulation which created obstacles or hindered the alleviation of the suffering of the people at that time. The Government's attitude is in stark contrast to that of the 1954 Government. While it was very sympathetic last January, it has <Col N="554" /> since turned its back on the communities along the river from the Shannon pot in County Cavan to Kilconly Point in County Kerry. There is considerable anger among farmers who, through no fault of their own, have incurred extensive losses of fodder and damage to their properties and homes. The Government is in power during the greatest economic boom ever. The coffers are so full that it does not know what to do with the money but it is the first Government in the history of the State not to provide one penny of assistance to the people experiencing financial hardship as a result of flooding.</P>
    <P>Over Christmas many communities were isolated as roads were impassable due to the floods. One elderly man had to go to Portiuncula Hospital but the ambulance could not reach his house. He had to be taken out in a transport box on the back of a tractor. Is this the type of health service the Government wants to stand over? On another occasion a woman had to be transported in and out of the flood to her father's funeral on the back of a county council lorry. Prior to January's Cabinet meeting at Ballaghaderreen both the N4 and the N5 were impassable due to the Shannon flood. How can we develop the west and bring economic balance to the region if we cannot get goods in and out of the area?</P>
    <P>While everybody was out celebrating the millennium, and the Taoiseach was lighting his millennium candle in Merrion Square, hundreds of people were stranded in their homes. They had no choice because if they tried to go out, they were liable to be drowned. That is not acceptable in the 21st century. How can anybody stand over this given that the ESB, the Office of Public Works, Dúchas, Waterways Ireland, Bord na Móna, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Galway, Offaly, Tipperary North Riding, Clare, Limerick and Kerry County Councils, Shannon Regional Fisheries and Coillte Teoranta all have an element of involvement in the control of water on the River Shannon? Yet the Government claims that there is no need for a Shannon authority.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has reneged on its responsibility to maintain the channel of the river. While it has carried out arterial drainage in the past, for which it is must be given credit, it has allowed water to flow into the Shannon catchment from its tributaries without carrying out any maintenance on the river itself. People who live along the river see land today that did not exist 20 or 30 years ago. The river is continuing to silt up, but no one is prepared to do anything. Along a four mile stretch of the river from Banagher to Meelick, silt and dirt have built up over the years, but have never been cleaned up. No one will take responsibility for water levels or maintaining gates on the Shannon, yet the Government says there is no need for an authority.</P>
    <P>There is a need for immediate funding for maintenance not just of the navigation channel but also of the river itself, to ensure that at least the channels are cleared. People accept that the <Col N="555" /> Shannon will continue to flood and understand that it has a natural flood plain, but they are not willing to witness their homes being flooded or isolated because the river is used as a dumping ground, silting up year after year. Why can maintenance work not be carried out on the stretch between Banagher and Meelick? Why can there not be one authority which can control all the gates along the river? Why can one body not be answerable to these communities? The answer is lack of political will. Is it too much to ask?</P>
    <P>The bodies trusted with controlling the gates, namely, Dúchas and the ESB, are incapable of co-ordinating with each other and do not meet their statutory responsibilities. During one bank holiday weekend the ESB opened the gates at Athlone on a Friday, but the Office of Public Works failed to open the gates at Meelick until the following Tuesday. During the intervening period hundreds of acres of land were flooded south of Athlone. Last September, the ESB left gates open at Athlone which, according to its own directives, should have been closed, thus facilitating flooding. The Office of Public Works claims not to have the powers to carry out work on the Shannon but when questioned on this issue before an Oireachtas committee, Office of Public Works officials admitted that they had the powers but had failed to seek funding. All these bodies have the powers to help regulate the river but do not have the will to do so. While this may be the main reason for the current push to establish an authority, it is by no means the only reason.</P>
    <P>Last summer the worst pollution ever was seen at Lough Ree. Along the banks of the river signs were posted warning people not to swim in the lake. A concerted and co-ordinated approach is required to ensure the environmental protection of the river. This is not happening at present. County councils which had to implement environmental by-laws have failed to do so. Some still allow raw sewage to flow from towns and villages into the river or its tributaries. There are only a handful of pump-out stations along the river, thus forcing boats to empty their sewage into the river. Again, a range of bodies is responsible including, Dúchas, Waterways Ireland, the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and the Marine and Natural Resources, 13 local authorities and industrial and farming organisations.</P>
    <P>The Shannon has huge tourism potential as it is one of our greatest natural resources. However, to date, very little has been done to maximise this potential. Comparing the Shannon waterway to that of its counterpart, the Erne, we have failed to capitalise on this asset and have neglected it. Few services have been provided along the waterway except at the major towns <i>en route</i>. Many of the islands on Lough Ree, which have significant historic settlements similar to Clonmacnoise, have remained in disrepair. The responsibility for this lies again with 13 local authorities, the five regional tourism boards, the Office of Public Works and an array of local tourism bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> There is little co-ordination between the 29 statutory bodies I have mentioned. I am sure there are others, and I hope they will not be too disappointed that I have not referred to them, including voluntary bodies involved in the development of the river. However, with such a large range of statutory bodies and corresponding Departments, is it any wonder that the true potential of the river has never been realised? The problem is that there are too many chiefs and not enough indians, each playing the blame game for failing to tackle these issues.</P>
    <P>There can only be a co-ordinated approach to the preservation, maintenance and development of the Shannon with the establishment of a statutory authority, which is answerable to this House and can ensure that these bodies fulfil their statutory responsibilities. These bodies have the power to implement the changes required but do not have the will to do so. They are similar to the Government, which has paid lip service to the people of the Shannon basin and talked around the issue without lifting a finger &ndash; for generations the Fianna Fáil Party has done the same. If the Government feels that if it talks long enough the people will soon forget, it is in for a rude awakening because the people will not be treated like fools. They are not willing to listen to lame excuses or tolerate Government inaction any longer while waiting for the floods to take their homes and isolate their villages. The Government has a golden opportunity to establish this authority and reassure the people that the controls will be put in place. I urge the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment and support our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, for tabling this motion to establish a statutory Shannon authority. Twice in my short political career I have witnessed the flooding south of Athlone. Roads were impassable, fodder was destroyed and houses and animals were isolated. The entire area was under water. It was only a disaster in terms of damage to feedstuffs but people were rendered immobile because the roads were impassable and dangerous. It is unfair that people must live in such conditions in this day and age, particularly in the era of the Celtic tiger. Money is regularly allocated to various groups and individuals but nothing has been provided to those who were marooned during the flooding of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time a public meeting was called in the Shamrock Lodge Hotel in Athlone which was attended by almost 1,000 people. They represented all the interest groups along the Shannon, including farmers, statutory bodies and the tourism industry. Various statements were made about the flooding but all speakers made the point that the Shannon has been untouched for many years. There has been no maintenance and it has been neglected. Silt and debris have been building up along the river for some time to the extent that there are artificial islands in parts of <Col N="557" /> it. Nothing has been done to clear it. Downstream of Athlone there is a build up of material in the Shannon stopping the flow of water which would clear much of the area.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming desire of those at the gathering in Athlone was that there should be a statutory authority for the Shannon which would bring together the various interest groups and find some way to move the situation forward and help the people living along the Shannon. They face this problem on a small scale every year and on a major scale every seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>Various politicians made commitments at the meeting and it is interesting to recall what they said. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, said she would back the Shannon authority, although she was careful to divorce herself from the Government. There is a simple motion before the House tonight to establish a statutory authority for the Shannon. If the Minister is to stand by what she said in Athlone, she will cross the floor of the House tomorrow night and vote for this motion. Many people who vote for Deputy O'Rourke who were at the meeting are in the public gallery tonight. They will see if she lives up to the promises she made in the Shamrock Lodge Hotel. If she is to be believed, and if she is to bring credibility to politics, she will have to live up to what she said.</P>
    <P>This is the third opportunity that Members of the Oireachtas have had to decide the fate of a Shannon authority. They had the opportunity when Deputy Brendan Daly introduced a Bill in the Seanad when he was a Member of that House. What happened? Fianna Fáil Senators&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to refer to the proceedings of the other House in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Suffice to say that a Bill brought forward in the Seanad was voted down with the help of Fianna Fáil Senators, some of whom had given commitments in Athlone that they would support it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose introduced a very worthwhile Shannon authority Bill. Unfortunately, because of Government manoeuvring, it did not even see the light of day. Having been printed, it did not even reach Second Stage because the Government opposed it. That shows the Government's lack of concern for those living in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight's motion is simple, either people are for the establishment of a Shannon authority or against it. If the Government tables an amendment, it is against it. I would regret that and I hope the Minister will do something about it. The writing may be on the wall, however, now that many of those who spoke in Athlone are not going to stand by the promises they gave there. Will the Minister use his good offices to introduce at least some assistance for the people in Clanown, south of Athlone? The roads there are impassable not just when there is extraordinary <Col N="558" /> flooding, but even with the normal flooding. Could the necessary funding be provided so that the roads will be passable? </P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support this motion. I remember in 1969, during the General Election in which my father was a candidate, seeing the late Brian Lenihan standing on a soap box outside Annaduff Church and saying that when Fianna Fáil was returned to Government it would drain the Shannon. Promises have been made to drain the Shannon on numerous occasions and the flow has increased since then. Adoption of this motion would alleviate some of the seasonal difficulties faced by those living along the Shannon. No political party wants to drain the Shannon; we want to introduce controls which will help the people living along the Shannon and its tributaries who suffer flooding on a regular basis and to establish an authority to which they could refer their difficulties.</P>
      <P>On Christmas eve in Carrick-on-Shannon, the busiest shopping day of the year, between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. the local fire brigade had to attend three shops on the main street which were flooded due to the flooding of the Shannon. It is appalling this still happens at the start of the 21st century. People trying to do business had to call the fire brigade on the busiest shopping day of the year because of flooding from the Shannon overflow. In the Athlone area people are stranded for days at a time. We cannot stand idly by.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy Coveney, when he was Minister, introduced legislation to finance funding for some areas prone to flooding. Some excellent work has been done in my constituency by the Office of Public Works under that scheme. That was thoughtful legislation and it is in line with what the motion calls on the Government to do &ndash; to put thoughtful legislation and funding in place to alleviate these problems.</P>
      <P>This winter the large elderly population in St. Patrick's Park, Carrick-on-Shannon, was marooned for a week. The only way to get out was to walk three miles across fields or to get on a boat. That situation should not have been allowed to develop. In Leitrim village three families had to leave their homes because of flooding. Those people expressed frustration that they did not know where to go or whom to approach. They contacted the county council, which stated that it was not its problem, that the problem was caused by the ESB. The ESB said, when contacted, that the problem was caused by Bord na Móna depositing silt into the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A multiplicity of organisations is involved in the maintenance of the Shannon system. If a statutory body was established, public representatives in the areas affected by flooding would have a place to which to address questions about what is being done and the funding being provided to <Col N="559" /> resolve the problem. At present we are being fobbed off by one organisation after another. This is an opportunity for the Government to show its commitment to the establishment of a system which would help to alleviate such difficulties.</P>
    <P>I attended the meeting in Athlone organised by the IFA. The major proposal was that one body with responsibility for the Shannon should be established. I also vividly remember the Minister for Public Enterprise, Mrs. O'Rourke, stating that she would support that proposal. I would like to know if she has put that proposal to Cabinet. If she is willing to support that, I have no doubt a number of her Cabinet colleagues would support her because she knows the difficulties her constituents have had to endure over time.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government has tabled an amendment to this motion. We are not trying to score any political points but are trying to have a proper debate on a problem which has pertained for too long and to establish a statutory River Shannon Authority which would alleviate the problems for people whose homes and lands are flooded on a seasonal basis.

      <P>I will come back to Deputy Connaughton's points in a moment. We do not need a statutory authority for flooding. That is an essential point to make at the start of this debate. In fairness to Deputy Connaughton, he spoke about a range of issues about which I am deeply concerned. I am genuinely trying to find a mechanism and a way to move forward. That is why &ndash; I hope the rationale will become clearer when I speak &ndash; I have done what I have done in the context of the committee. I concur with Deputy Connaughton's view on what happened in January with the two committees. It was very helpful to me in the contact which has been made in terms of how the committee might see a role for itself in assisting me in pursuing this matter.</P>
      <P>In terms of the authority I have in this area, I am very limited. However, I can say to the House that as far as my Department is concerned, we will co-operate fully with the committee and will help it. We will provide it with all the information which may be available in terms of coming to a conclusion on this matter. I say to Deputy Connaughton that I want to see this matter expedited by the committee as quickly as possible. I expect it will do so. It will have the authority to call any person, to form a view and to present a report, which I welcome. I will welcome whatever emerges from that report because I have no doubt the quality of the work of the committee involved will be up to its usual standard.</P>
      <P>I am here this evening because of the general responsibility of the Office of Public Works in relation to arterial drainage and flood relief issues. However, I want to make it clear at the outset that the Office of Public Works does not have any specific responsibility in relation to the main channel of the Shannon River. I am not saying that to excuse us but Members might understand the difficulty I have in my own responsibilities and that is why I need to put that on record in terms of what I can deliver. What I might want to deliver and what I can deliver may be best served, as I have suggested, by the course of action I outlined in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of this motion, the formation of a Shannon River Authority, has been discussed previously. There are many bodies, State, semi-State and private sector with interests in the <Col N="561" /> Shannon River. The purpose of this amendment is to bring these interests together to engage in a meaningful discussion of all the issues in this complex problem. The issues are enormous, diverse and complex.</P>
    <P>I would like to set out the background to the issue under discussion. The River Shannon, as we know, is the largest river in these islands and drains an area of more than 14,100 square kilometres &ndash; about one fifth of the total area of the country. The river has a total length of 336 kilometres and can be divided into four distinct reaches. First, the head water area above Lough Allen which is mountainous with steep and torrential river channels. Second, the central 250 kilometres from Lough Allen to Killaloe within which the Shannon is joined by five major tributaries and drains much of the central plain of Ireland. Here the river has a very flat gradient with a total fall of about 17 meters and is characterised by low ill-defined banks and wide adjoining callows. This reach includes a series of large lakes, including Loughs Allen, Ree and Derg which exercise a considerable modifying effect on the flow regime. Third, the 29 kilometres from Killaloe to Limerick where a fall of about 30 meters is concentrated and the major portion of the flow is now diverted through the head and tail race channels of the Ardnacrusha power development. Fourth, the 83 kilometre tidal estuary from Limerick to the Atlantic ocean.</P>
    <P>There are very many organisations, national and local, with statutory obligations for the management of the catchment through an assigned responsibility for a particular aspect of river or catchment performance. For example, Waterways Ireland has responsibility for navigation and, as such, will exercise limited control over water levels in lakes and river stretches. Similarly, the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, has statutory responsibility for the control of lake levels arising from water requirements for hydroelectric generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha. Local authorities &ndash; ten county councils &ndash; in the catchment monitor water quality with the assistance of a number of laboratories and have responsibility for its control.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works' only responsibility is for maintenance on those tributaries where capital works have been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. The Office of Public Works hydrometric service gathers water level and discharge information at a number of sites on the river.</P>
    <P>Requests for the setting up of a single statutory authority for the River Shannon have been made on numerous occasions over the years and have been rejected by successive Governments. This current request seems to be prompted by the recent winter flooding of the Shannon catchment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> The problem of drainage in the Shannon basin is long standing and has a history of reports and investigations over the past 200 years. River Shannon flooding over the years has been the subject of much study by local and Government authorities and steps have been taken at various times to achieve some degree of control of floods and some amelioration of the resultant damages. By and large, however, the problem has been so extensive and complex that proposed schemes have been found too costly in relation to benefits obtained.</P>
    <P>A number of studies and reports on this problem have been prepared in the past and are the sources of much valuable information. I intend to make these reports and any further information I have in my Department available to the committee as it will be a helpful starting point for it. The first of these reports is (a) 1939 &ndash; by the Board of Public Works &ndash; Report on Shannon navigation, Statement of Evidence for Drainage Commission 1938. This report, in addition to its coverage of navigation, contains much valuable and authoritative information on the River Shannon flood problem, especially from the historical aspects and with respect to possible solutions. The second report is (b) 1938-1940 &ndash; By the Drainage Commission, Ireland. This comprehensive report on flood and drainage problems throughout Ireland included consideration on the River Shannon. The report reviews the general flood problems of the basin together with the past history of flow control; discusses certain alternative solutions including (1) channel enlargement by excavation and (2) protection by embankments with provision of pumping plants, neither of which were found feasible on a large scale and recommended the allocation of £345,000 for certain limited works which would provide some amelioration of flood conditions. Due to World War II and other unfavourable factors, little work on the main stem of the River Shannon was undertaken along these recommendations. However, drainage works were completed on the River Brosna, a principal tributary.</P>
    <P>The third report is (c) 1951 &ndash; by the Electricity Supply Board &ndash; Informal report on &ldquo;proposal for Power Development and Drainage of River Shannon as Outlined in Mr. Boland's Memorandum of July 1951&rdquo;, having special reference to a suggested scheme for hydro-electric power development on River Suck. The fourth report is (d) 1952 &ndash; by the Electricity Supply Board &ndash; Description of Board activities and principal generating in Ireland. Other reports available are (e) 1954, Annual Report of Electricity Supply Board; (f) 1955, a general review of the River Shannon flood problem in the light of the 1954 flood by Mr. J. P. Candy, the Chief Engineer, Board of Public Works; (g) 1955, a memorandum from the power development aspect, including consideration of storage by Mr. J. W. MacDonald, Chief <Col N="563" /> Civil Engineer, Electricity Supply Board; (h) 1955, a memorandum report on Shannon River Flooding (1954), including a suggestion for evacuation of flood areas by the Irish Land Commission; and (i) 1955, an informal memorandum on agricultural aspects of the flood problem by Dr. Walsh, Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>These reports all highlight the complexity of the problem in both technical and financial terms. The most significant studies were carried out at the request of the Government by Louis E. Rydell of the US Army Corps of Engineers in the mid-1950s and the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Rydell report is constantly referred to by everybody and its contents have much merit. These bodies jointly examined and reported on the proposals contained in the Rydell report. All the reports were published. They concluded that there is no simple or obvious solution to the flood problem in the Shannon Basin; any solution would be both costly and complex. This is further substantiated by the report commissioned by the Irish Farmers' Association and launched in Athlone in October, 1998, which came to the same conclusion.</P>
    <P>An unusually large flood in December, 1954, which caused severe and prolonged hardship again highlighted the problem of inadequate drainage of the Shannon. The Government of the day sought the services of the US Army Corps of Engineers, a recognised world authority on flood control and, in August 1956, Mr. Louis Rydell of the USACE made a detailed report outlining the problem and some possible solutions. He suggested <i>inter alia</i> (i) undertaking preliminary engineering investigations to test a number of the more favourable possibilities of the control of floods, selected from those postulated in his report; (ii) establishment of a Shannon River Basin Inter-agency Committee or Commission, which would serve as a medium for correlating various points of view, advising on procedures relating to an overall investigation programme and co-ordinating its effective execution. This committee would exercise advisory rather than executive powers &ndash; actual prosecution of engineering, economic, agricultural and other studies would normally be retained as a function of the appropriate, regularly constituted, department or agency.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Government approved in principle the recommendations of the Rydell report and initiated a first stage investigation of the problem. This investigation was carried out between 1958 and 1961 under the joint auspices of the ESB and the Office of Public Works combining the drainage of the main Shannon stem with a comprehensive plan for the tributary catchments, due regard being given to other users of the river. The joint report recommended a <Col N="564" /> more detailed second investigation which would establish costs and benefits with an accuracy sufficient to enable decisions to be taken in regard to carrying out selected works. The report also agreed with the Rydell recommendation that consideration be given to the establishment of the inter-agency committee, which would necessarily include representatives of a wide range of authorities and interests, national and local. A recommendation by Mr. Rydell that a small, specially qualified, task force, capable of adequately representing all the various interests, be set up to carry out detailed examination and design of drainage proposals was reiterated in the joint report.</P>
    <P>In 1987, the Irish Farmers' Association commissioned an independent report by consulting engineers, Delap and Waller. They were asked: &ldquo;to advise and report on the technical aspects of the River Shannon flooding problem, with particular reference to how it affects the interests of the members of the IFA&rdquo;. The scope of the report included an evaluation of the technical information available and, if appropriate, to identify and recommend remedial works to effect significant local amelioration of the flooding problem.</P>
    <P>At that time, the Office of Public Works made available to the consultants whatever reports, information and hydrometric records it had. The conclusion of the consultants at that time was as follows:</P>
    <P>There are no obvious localised engineering works, apparent to us, which if undertaken, would significantly improve the regime of the River Shannon. Removal of the weir at Meelick and the silt banks downstream would not have a significant effect.</P>
    <P>It is important that Lough Allen be operated within the fullest range of its current limits and that Lough Ree is drawn down to the absolute lowest level compatible with navigation requirements so that as much storage as possible is available to delay or ameliorate the onset of some of the mid to late minor summer floods. It appears to us that the suggestion for lowering the current minimum water level for navigation between Athlone and Meelick, as an additional storage facility, has no merit other than providing improved drainage to callow lands while the level is lowered.</P>
    <P>The possibility of providing viable localised flood relief by the construction of embankments or the carrying out of drainage works on small tributaries or on part of some tributaries, without sensibly exacerbating existing conditions in the main river should be pursued.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna seems to have provided a reasonably satisfactory system for preventing large quantities of peat silt from entering adjoining rivers. The success of the system is <Col N="565" /> very dependent on proper maintenance of their siltation ponds.</P>
    <P>An experienced management and operating structure is available for attending to such controls as exist in the River Shannon. The ESB and the Office of Public Works do so in tandem and although there is no formal link between them a reasonably effective liaison exists.</P>
    <P>In October, 1988, my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Noel Treacy, then Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, on the occasion of the launch of the IFA-commissioned report on the Shannon flooding problem, announced the establishment of a forum at which the views of the various bodies interested in the Shannon could be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Forum, comprising representatives from elected members of local authorities along the River Shannon, local authority officials, boating, fishing wildlife and tourism interests, the industrial and agricultural sector, the ESB and the Office of Public Works, afforded the various parties an opportunity to express the views of the organisations which they represented. It was intended to co-ordinate the use of the resources of the river and ensure that consensus was arrived at in the more efficient management of those resources. With such a multiplicity of interest groups, open discussion on the varying viewpoints was considered beneficial to all concerned. Among the matters discussed, considered or resolved by the forum were planning and development matters, pollution incidents, navigation matters and flooding events.</P>
    <P>The proposed EU Framework Directive on Water Policy sets a framework for a comprehensive management of water resources within the European Union, within a common approach and with common objectives, principles and basic measures. Deputy Connaughton was somewhat dismissive of this in the context of the points I am trying to make and which I made some weeks ago. There are elements of importance in regard to this. The proposed water management framework will be based on the river basin, as the natural unit for management and will require the development of the River Basin Management Plans. Member states will have to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is adopted for the achievement of the objectives of the proposed directive and for the implementation of programmes of measures for this purpose. Intense negotiations have been ongoing for some time between the EU and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is not something that has been put on the long finger, quite the opposite &ndash; I am trying to accelerate the pace substantially in moving my amendment. The proposed directive addresses surface waters, estuarine and coastal waters and groundwater, and will repeal and <Col N="566" /> replace several existing EU directives in relation to individual aspects of water management.</P>
    <P>The objectives are: to prevent deterioration of water quality; to achieve &ldquo;good quality status&rdquo; in surface waters and ground waters within a 16-year time frame generally; to protect ecosystems, which is vitally important in the Shannon, and achieve compliance with any standards and objectives for &ldquo;Protected Areas&rdquo;, which is a huge issue in that area, (for example, areas designated for the protection of habitats or species) within a 16-year time frame generally; to ensure supplies of water for drinking and other purposes; to promote sustainable water use; and to mitigate the effects of floods and droughts. There is a huge range of issues that Deputy Connaughton and other Deputies touched on which come specifically within the remit of that directive.</P>
    <P>The proposal requires that measures be taken within each river basin for matters such as: the determination of the characteristics &ndash; type &ndash; of waters concerned; the operation of monitoring programmes in respect of water quality; the control of direct and diffuse discharges to water; the review of the impact of human activity on the status of the waters; the establishment of environmental objectives aimed to achieve quality targets; the drawing up and implementation of a programme of measures to achieve the established environmental objectives; and the carrying out of an economic analysis of water use.</P>
    <P>The problem of eutrophication or over enrichment has been shown in a number of studies to be the main threat to the water quality of the River Shannon. This has been clearly attributed to excessive inputs of nutrients, particularly phosphorous, to the inflowing rivers and their tributaries. These studies have chronicled the decline in water quality over the past 20 years, and this deterioration in water quality has endangered the general quality of these waters and also reduced their value as public amenities, particularly as a source of potable water.</P>
    <P>The Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment monitoring and management system has been developed to promote a catchment-based approach for reducing phosphorous inputs to rivers and lakes from all sources. The system undertakes to identify river stretches experiencing the effects of pollution, to catalogue the principal causes in each instance and to propose a range of key management measures which may be implemented by individual local authorities in problem areas. This approach is in keeping with Government policy which envisages a more integrated approach between authorities in promoting water quality management and in recognising the catchment as the most appropriate basis for developing and implementing water management strategies.</P>
    <P>The Government has responded to the ongoing <Col N="567" /> decline in surface water quality with the introduction in 1998 of the phosphorus regulations which have, for the first time, established statutory environmental quality standards for phosphorus. Target time frames have been set for the elimination of seriously polluted river stretches, incremental improvements in river channels currently slightly or moderately polluted and the restoration of lakes that are eutrophic to satisfactory conditions.</P>
    <P>The two most relevant European Community legislative instruments are the birds directive, adopted in 1979, and the habitats and species directive, adopted in 1992. The birds directive, Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds, as the title suggests is concerned with bird species whereas the habitats directive, Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, in many respects represents a broadening of the Birds Directive to the full range of fauna and flora and also habitats.</P>
    <P>The birds directive requires EU member states to provide for the conservation of all bird species, including by ensuring that the habitats of all species are adequately conserved. The directive further requires that protected areas, special protection areas, are established for species that are rare, vulnerable, in danger of extinction or otherwise require special attention, and migratory species.</P>
    <P>The aim of the habitats and species directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-diversity and it requires member states to take measures to maintain or restore natural habitats and species at a favourable conservation status in the Community. Under the directive, member states are required, <i>inter alia</i>, to designate protected areas, SACs, for certain natural habitats being ones which are in danger of disappearance, are rare or represent outstanding examples of their type and for a more limited number of species which are listed in the directive. Both the birds and habitats and species directives have been transposed into Irish law by way of regulations introduced in 1985 and subsequently and in 1997, respectively. The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, transposing the habitats and species directive, are the more significant as they provide not only for the designation of SACs but also for the protection measures that apply to SPAs as well as SACs. It is expected that the proposed Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment of a national network of protected areas of both wildlife and geological importance &ndash; national heritage areas.</P>
    <P>Waterfowl winter on the Shannon system and its tributaries, notably the Little Brosna and the Suck rivers, in internationally important numbers. Wading species breed there particularly in the section between Athlone and Portumna. This is <Col N="568" /> especially the case for the corncrake which is the subject of a special scheme with farmers on the Callows where particular management practices such as centre cut mowing and delayed cutting are essential.</P>
    <P>The lakes and rivers are also important habitats for many other species of plants and animals. The two main lakes, Lough Ree and Lough Derg, are thought to still contain the very rare and endangered fish species, pollan, which also exists in Lough Neagh and possibly Lough Erne. Outside Ireland, the other main populations are in Siberia, Canada and Alaska. The Shannon river is also important as the Irish centre of distribution for several aquatic and marsh plants. There are many sites designated for nature conservation purposes along the river for a range of habitats including lakes, fens, rivers, adjacent turloughs and bogs. Overall, the Shannon is, in ecological terms, one of the most important sites in Western Europe. It has, however, up to now been treated as a series of separate sites, not as one large system that needs to be managed as such if it is to be conserved from a series of threats from eutrophication, siltation, increased water colour from bog drainage, increased recreational pressure and the introduction of alien species, zebra mussel, which is spreading throughout the Shannon system.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the way Deputies listened to my remarks. If we are talking about a Shannon authority it will impinge on a huge range of issues. It is not as simple as me, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, marching in on my own with a Shannon authority. That is why I have taken what I hope is the correct action of putting it in a forum that can, once and for all, tease out all the issues and question all the players, some of whom may not wish to be questioned.</P>

      <P>It is not as it may appear. Neither the Office of Public Works nor I would deny it but, without question, there is a better way of co-ordinating all the activities in the Shannon river system. However, it does not necessarily mean that if there was a Shannon authority it would have a magic formula as regards flooding which has always been the driving force behind the issue, but that is another matter. What we are talking about is a very broad range of issues and Deputy Connaughton was right when he mentioned that. I have tried to do that in setting the background to all the issues for the committee and the House, irrespective of whether we like them, to move forward what would be the criteria and basis for getting everyone together and targeting what should be the responsibilities and outcomes. Various Governments over the years have tried to deal with this issue but nothing has happened because the focus has been too narrow. We have a wider range of activities and I commend the two committees on the way they pursued the issue and demanded action &ndash;</P>

      <P>Some of the bodies outlined are central or local government bodies or semi-State organisations with statutory functions and powers. Others are voluntary, leisure or social clubs catering for recreational needs of local people. Yet others are commercial, farming or industrial, depending to some extent on the river for the commercial success of their business.</P>
      <P>I have described some of the early attempts at finding solutions which were based in the main on land use and drainage issues. All this leads to a complex interaction of the requirements of these various organisations. In an effort to explore these issues the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine met in joint session in January this year. In his summing up the Chairman of the meeting, Deputy Seán Doherty, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> . . . on the one hand, a decision must be made on whether there should be a single authority. [I have an open mind on that.] On the other hand, we must decide whether anything reasonable can be done to reduce the impact and effect of flooding on the farming community and residents.</P>
    <P>The question is whether a single authority would improve the position in real terms or provide solutions to these difficulties. If so, what powers and functions should be set down for the authority and how should it function in relation to existing statutory bodies and their existing legislative responsibilities?</P>
    <P>It is clear that a significant consultative process is required to examine these questions if the matter is to be moved forward. The committee has in its membership of both Houses of the Oireachtas the experience necessary to do this and to bring to Government and this House its considered views. In the light of these questions I have, after consultation with the Government, decided to refer issues relating to the management of the River Shannon to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. I welcome this motion. It has provided me with a direct mechanism to do something on this issue. Deputy Connaughton said earlier that if I get involved in something I generally see it through. I am determined that will be the outcome in this case also.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, who tabled the motion. He has accepted an addendum from me to give me an opportunity to introduce the Shannon River Authority Bill, 2000.</P>

    <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the Minister and, therefore, we are <i>ad idem</i> in respect of much of what has been called for tonight.

However, the Government has been in disarray on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is the longest river in Ireland at 210 miles long, rising in the Cuilcagh Mountains in Cavan and flowing southwards through Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg, Limerick city, Shannon estuary and out to the Atlantic Ocean. The critical area is the upper Shannon catchment area which is about 9,000 sq. kilometres from Lough Allen to Carrick-on-Shannon, through a channel which is effectively a series of lakes, Lough Ree, from Athlone to Portumna at the head of Lough Derg. There is an important stretch of about 27 miles, the worst affected area, between Athlone and Meelick weir. The upper Shannon drains most of the low-lying central plane of Ireland. It is probably the most examined stretch of waterway in the world in respect of tackling the problems dating back to the 1930s and the Rydell report, right up to the IFA and the Coopers and Lybrand report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion and my addendum have been brought before the House for a valid reason and this is not a political exercise. In January I held a press conference at the Shamrock Lodge Hotel in Athlone to launch the Labour Party's Shannon River Authority Bill. During that launch a young woman told of how she and her family were forced to wade through a flooded house to attend the funeral of her deceased father who had passed away suddenly. That woman was angry and upset, and rightly so. In a modern society, nobody should have to deal with a bereavement in such an undignified way. That is evidence of the human problems wrought by the flooding in this and in other areas in Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Galway and Offaly. I shall speak mostly about Westmeath because the Shannon includes a large area from Carrickabrien, Clonown, Golden Island and Ballinahown. Having seen the extent of the devastation wrought on the various homesteads, farms, businesses, it is foolish to speak in terms of huge sums of money and the wherewithal, while being unable to solve a problem of this dimension in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>As the Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture, food and rural development and as a public representative for the midlands, and more particularly, Westmeath, I am adamant that the victims of the Shannon floods should not be forced to wade through their homes next winter. Their problems deserve a political response. In fairness the Minister has tried to give a measured response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion and the addendum calling for the establishment of a single authority for the River <Col N="572" /> Shannon provides the Government with a golden opportunity to take action.</P>
    <P>I envisage that a single authority would provide a medium to long-term solution. It would deal with the flooding problems but also with much more. As it stands there is no single authority in the Shannon basin to deal with flooding. I have counted up to 43 authorities. I accept the Minister has knowledge of about 30 of them. At the end of the day the response to flooding and management problems is characterised by delay and denial. Farmers, business people and ordinary householders in those areas agree there is delay and denial by a whole host of State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Up to 1996 the Office of Public Works had control but after that responsibility was transferred to Dúchas. At the meeting in Athlone the Office of Public Works said it was not its responsibility as its responsibility ceased after that time. Statutory intervention means that somebody else assumes responsibility.</P>
    <P>A perusal of the Bills book will show that since 1932, there have been a total of ten Bills before the Oireachtas which have dealt with the operation of activities pertaining to the Shannon river, including fisheries and navigation. Given the extent of the list of Bills, it is clear that an overall policy on the Shannon has been missing for some time. The Bill which I am presenting in the addendum before the House, provides once and for all, a structured mechanism &ndash; in the form of a regulated authority &ndash; for delivering policy in the development of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The work of that authority could significantly reduce flooding and ensure that people in the midlands are not left without a livelihood if flooding recurs. In my Bill, I have proposed that the Shannon River Authority would have overall responsibility for the management and improvement of the Shannon catchment. The authority would be obliged to submit a five-year plan to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with regard to its proposed activities to improve the river and surrounding areas. That ministerial responsibility could be with any Minister.</P>
    <P>The plan would deal with fisheries, navigation, the improvement by drainage of the lands adjacent to the Shannon, the improvement of water quality as well as the protection and enhancement of the river's environment and of the natural habitats of its bird life and fish life. While I am a barrister I do not have any monopoly of wisdom on how to draft a Bill but I would have a little more exposure than a lay person. If my proposal is taken in conjunction with the other Bills, including Deputy Daly's Bill which contained many good proposals, it would constitute a major step forward. I happen to be on the sub-commit<Col N="573" /> tee with Deputy Connaughton and we will not let it lie.</P>
    <P>The authority would include representatives from the farming sector, community interests, tourism interests, fisheries and a range of statutory bodies such as the Office of Public Works, Bord na Móna, the ESB, Dúchas and all relevant local authorities. It would have complete responsibility for directing all public bodies where relevant and for the management of the Shannon catchment area.</P>
    <P>When the flooding in the Shannon catchment was at its height in January, I was made aware by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, that she was open to the establishment of a single authority. I hope she will continue to give that support which is critical.</P>
    <P>The recent treatment of the problems of the Shannon by the Government do not instil confidence in the people of the midlands who have been the victims of flooding. The Government was in disarray on the issue but may have come together this evening. Despite the widespread consensus among political parties and among the residents of the Shannon catchment area that a single authority is required to manage recurring problems, the Government said it has no plans to introduce legislation to allow that to take place. I was vice-chairman of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport which was to deal with those issues but the Minister appears to have referred them back. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment did not inspire confidence two weeks ago when she said there were no plans to introduce legislation. The sub-committee has, therefore, become functionless and useless.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in the Shamrock Lodge hotel, Athlone, organised by the IFA to voice deep concern at the havoc wrought among householders and businesses in Athlone and the surrounding areas. The attendance of more than 500 came from counties Longford, Roscommon, Galway, Offaly and Sligo. The meeting tried to establish who was to blame for the devastation caused by flooding. Chief executives and senior managers of various statutory authorities attended and answered questions. At the meeting a great deal of scepticism was expressed at the fact that the level of water in the river had dropped dramatically in the preceding few days. Finger pointing, accusations and strong denials were the order of the day.</P>
    <P>I said at the meeting that I hoped that when the level of water dropped the problem would not be forgotten and the search for solutions postponed. I have persisted in asking parliamentary questions on this issue because I do not want the Government to forget about this problem simply because the immediate crisis has passed. Next winter the same problems will be visited on the people of the Shannon basin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The flooding of the Shannon in the middle of last winter was the worst since 1954. Businesses were forced to close because plant was under water. The unfortunate business people, residents and farmers in the river Shannon catchment area had a cruel introduction to the new millennium. There was a general acceptance by those who attended the meeting in Athlone that the foolish proposition, first made in the 1950s, that the River Shannon be drained should not be repeated. That nonsense should have gone out with the fairies. Let us start from a sensible position. There is widespread acceptance that whatever authority is set up will not be charged with draining the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>A large number of residents complained about the way their houses were devastated by the flooding. Christmas by the banks of the River Shannon was a wash-out for many Athlone families in 1999. Evidence of the havoc sustained could be clearly seen when we visited the affected areas. I am very grateful to farmers who drove me around in their tractors and jeeps, particularly Fintan Nally in Conbonny. I recall vividly visiting distraught families in Carrickabrien, Golden Island, Clonbonny, Clonown, Deerpark housing estate and Ballinahown. It is only when one examines the physical devastation of the floods combined with the emotional turmoil of elderly residents that one appreciates the horrendous impact of the disturbance visited on the unfortunate inhabitants of those areas, among others.</P>
    <P>One resident whose devastation remains etched in my memory is 75 year old Mrs. Maura Doolin of Clonbonny, Athlone, who was forced to flee her home on St. Stephen's Day when her house, which she had recently renovated, was flooded to a depth of two feet. When the water retreated to the garden the soaked floorboards, damp walls and saturated furniture remained. Debris of leaves, silt and twigs from the Shannon adhered to the walls and littered the floor. The skirting and new wooden floorboards had swollen and buckled and will have to be completely replaced. People like Mrs. Doolin cannot get insurance. I heard on the radio today that a compensation package of £250,000 has been provided for flood victims in Limerick. I want monetary compensation for the people of Athlone, Clonbonny, Carrickabrien, Ballinahown and Clonown who suffered during the flooding and who cannot get insurance. I hope the flood victims of the Shannon basin are compensated but I am particularly concerned about the people of Westmeath because I have been sent to this House to articulate their concerns.</P>
    <P>The adjacent farm which belongs to the Galvin family was totally flooded and not a blade of grass could be seen in more than 45 acres of pasture. The winter stockpile of turf had also been soaked leading to a significant rise in costs for all the families in the area. There was grave concern <Col N="575" /> about the overflow from sewerage pipes as the remains of sewage could be seen as a result of waterlogged pipes. This was the focus of the complaints of the Deerpark housing estate when I visited them early in January.</P>
    <P>Roads were impassable and people were isolated and marooned. This was a sad indictment of our society as we enter the 21st century. The message from the public meeting in Athlone was that the time for talking was long past. The rising waters had eroded the patience of the people who had suffered the flooding of the Shannon basin. They were visibly tired of witnessing the annual apathy which follows each flood.</P>
    <P>There is no strategy in place to tackle flooding blackspots in urban or rural areas. Whatever little response is totally unco-ordinated because too many different authorities are involved in tackling the problem. A statutory authority is needed with real powers and a multi-annual budgeting approach. The authority will have to employ a co-ordinated strategic approach rather than piecemeal solutions which merely solve problems in one place by passing them down the line to somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 the Office of Public Works no longer has responsibility for the River Shannon. It has been passed on to Dúchas. The kernel of the flooding problem is the fact that no one is prepared to take responsibility for it, despite the fact that the environment of the Shannon has been detrimentally affected by the flooding. Numerous local authorities are in charge of functional areas along the Shannon and they implement the Department of the Environment and Local Government's policies in relation to water quality and environmental control. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development promotes pollution protection schemes in an agricultural context but these are rendered useless if there is a major flood. No matter how well retained slurry is, when flooding occurs problems with it arise.</P>
    <P>I stood in the yard of a 28 acre farm in Ballinahown and saw land submerged in three feet of water for as far as the eye could see. Paling posts were totally submerged. The farmer told me that after the last flood he had had extreme difficulty in getting £300 compensation. However, following the recent flood no compensation whatsoever is available. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has said that although there were some losses no compensation scheme is envisaged. The Minister for Finance has said that no compensation scheme will be provided for people such as Mrs. Doolin who lost everything in her home. The mid-winter flooding in the Shannon catchment area was a national emergency but now the motto seems to be, &ldquo;Out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;. Despite the Exchequer surplus of more than £1 billion, we cannot give a <Col N="576" /> ha'penny to these people to help their recovery. Winter fodder was lost, cattle were stranded and rescue operations had to be mounted. I saw a farmer use a boat to paddle out to bales of silage lying in three feet of water.</P>
    <P>Some of the flooding problems in the Shannon catchment area are related to arterial drainage in the tributaries of the Shannon. They all drain into it and this is part of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>A beautiful woodland area known as Mullaghmore plantation is very much a feature of the approach to Mullaghmore. It runs parallel to the approach road to the village and extends to approximately seven to 10 acres consisting mainly of sycamore, ash, willow, alder and some whitethorn. This area of mature deciduous woodlands was originally planted as a windbreak or shelter-belt. In the spring the leaves cover this woodland, thus adding to the magic of the area covered in a carpet of flowers with birds building nests. It acts as a screen as one approaches the village of Mullaghmore and it is important that the visual quality of the approach to the village should be preserved.</P>
      <P>Woodlands represent an important asset for the development of Mullaghmore as a tourist attraction. The village boasts a fine harbour, a safe beach with blue flag status, with mountains on one side and wonderful woodland on the other. This woodland provides a home for an entire world of birds and other wildlife. It is a peaceful environment with an air of tranquillity and silence. This plantation took generations of hard work to make it as we have it today to enjoy it. Previous generations have maintained it and handed it on to the people of Mullaghmore in good repair. The major concern is that we must protect what is there for future generations.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 6 April 2000, she indicated that Dúchas, the heritage service, regards it as a special area of conservation and that she had moved initially to ensure that damaging works would be stopped. Works are, however, still on-going on this estate and the Minister indicated she was considering further action, including possible restoration of the site or prosecution if appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building of Classiebawn Castle at Mullaghmore was begun by Lord Palmerston, then Prime Minister of England, and was completed by his step-son, Lord Mount Temple in 1874. The castle was built entirely of stone brought by sea from Donegal and the estate covers almost 1,000 acres. <Col N="577" /> Lord Palmerstown also built a harbour at Mullaghmore and imported marram grass plant from India. He planted this special grass seed along the entire coastline to keep the sand dunes from moving and to stop coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>The area marked 'commonage' on the map, a copy of which I can give the Minister later, is not part of Classiebawn Estate. Here the sand dunes are undisturbed. However, a significant number of the sand dunes and trees of Classiebawn Estate have been levelled and destroyed and the area now resembles a desert. This destruction can never be repaired. There is serious concern regarding the sand dunes, the fine trees being felled and the major threat from the slurry tanks on the estate. People are extraordinarily concerned by the apparent lack of controls.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 6 April, is the felling of trees taking place in an area of special conservation? Is the owner of the estate entitled to continue the indiscriminate felling of trees that is taking place?</P>
    <P>Mullaghmore, as the Minister may know, is a beautiful part of County Sligo. From 1950 the Mountbatten family holidayed annually at Classiebawn estate. It is a major tourist attraction and people love to visit it but it is very much disturbed. For generations it was an estate to which people had free access but now, to the annoyance of the population of Mullaghmore, the destruction of the sand dunes continues. The Minister alluded in her reply to &lsquo;possible restoration of the site'. Perhaps she might elaborate as to what she meant.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this issue which is of major concern. It is an historic building and estate and gives a sense of pride to the people of Mullaghmore since the time the Mountbatten family resided there on their holidays. Since that time, significant destruction has taken place. Can the Minister clarify what action she intends to take to rectify the problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The area referred to by the Deputy is part of the Bunduff Lough and Machair-Trawalua-Mullaghmore special area of conservation. It is an extensive coastal site which contains a significant range of habitats, including several listed on annex one of the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I share his concern for the conservation of this SAC and will take all necessary steps to ensure that any threat is dealt with. I am not at liberty to give full details of all dealings of my Department with a particular individual as I am still considering whether further action, including prosecution and/or restoration is warranted. However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department, through its local officers, has been aware of the works in question <Col N="578" /> and has been resolute in ensuring that those which endanger the SAC are stopped.</P>
    <P>At one stage an undertaking was secured that the works would stop but this undertaking was broken on the afternoon of 5 April this year. However, following the further intervention of my officers, the work on the SAC lands was again stopped. The Chief State Solicitor's office subsequently wrote to the landowner on my behalf advising that, unless he gave a written undertaking not to damage the SAC, I would proceed in the High Court to obtain such interim orders as might be required to preserve the integrity of these lands.</P>
    <P>I have received this written undertaking which is as follows: &ldquo;I undertake that I will not carry out or cause my servants or agents to carry out or continue to carry out any works, operations or activities of any variety on any of the SAC lands other than such operations or activities as are expressly permitted by the 1997 regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the situation will continue to be closely monitored and that if any additional action is needed it will be forthcoming. In addition, as I have already indicated, I am considering whether further action in terms of restoration and/or prosecution is necessary. Perhaps at this point I should restate my policy in relation to the protection of SACs and other designated areas.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that the most effective conservators are those who live and work on the land. Most of the sites designated as SACs would not have endured through the ages unless they had already been managed in a sensitive and sustainable manner. I, therefore, lay great store in harnessing the good will that exists and in increasing knowledge and awareness of the new enhanced status these sites now enjoy.</P>
    <P>Specific measures I have undertaken include the establishment of local liaison committees, the development of a system of informal local consultation which facilitates quick decisions and practical advice and the establishment of an independent appeals board.</P>
    <P>What I want and will continue to pursue is that these sites will be owned emotionally as well as physically by local people. Some people find it ironic that the two Ministers most directly charged with the implementation of the EU Habitats Directive, myself and the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, happen to represent constituencies blessed with an abundance of these special areas.</P>
    <P>However, it is fair to say that by adopting the reasonable approach we have been able to prove that local concerns can be married to ecological imperatives. I can also assure the Deputy that I have the legislative powers necessary to protect these areas from wanton or deliberate destruction and that, when necessary, I have used them. Not <Col N="579" /> only is it my inclination to act decisively against wanton destruction, it is also my duty and I will not shrink from it.</P>
    <P>It is a mark of our maturity as a society that the majority of people accept that rights of ownership are not absolute and they must be exercised in the context of the common good, whether that good be the local community, the county or, as in this context, the larger European one. In a small number of cases where individuals deliberately ignore or break the law relating to the protection of SACs they will be subject to the full rigours of these laws. The rule of law is fundamental to any civilised society, whether it relates to SACs or any other aspect of our co-operative life.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for his interest in this important issue. His interest, like that of many private individuals and concerned organisations, greatly increases our ability to keep a watching brief on these widespread and diverse sites making it a truly community effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for being present. There is an urgent need for a detailed examination of why there is such a high level of death by suicide in our prisons. There must be a comprehensive review of how the mentally ill are treated in the prison service. Ireland has the second lowest crime rate in Europe but the highest prison suicide rate. Six prisoners suffered death by suicide last year.</P>
      <P>I raise the issue of the death by suicide in the care of the State in Wheatfield Prison last Friday of Anthony Cawley who had a sad and difficult life and who caused severe damage and extreme hurt to the victims of his crimes. He was a very damaged man, damaged while incarcerated in the institutions selected by the State to deal with him. He died while in a State institution. These institutions robbed him of his childhood, left him vulnerable to sexual assault by the State's employees and left him to rot at the age of seven. He was repeatedly raped in Trudder House which in its time, as reported recently by Anne Marie Hourihan in the<i> Sunday Tribune</i>, is thought to have employed a total of five paedophiles. This raises the question of who exactly Trudder House was for. I call on the Minister to publish details of the Eastern Health Board's investigations into the horrible abuse inflicted there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious to the social services that the prisoner had a serious psychiatric disorder and needed long-term care. Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins described his probation officer's report on his background as one of the most harrowing he had ever read. The response of the State was to <Col N="580" /> place him in a cell and check him every 15 minutes as he was at high risk of suicide. This approach is totally unacceptable. This view is shared by Dr. Charles Smith of the Central Mental Hospital. Clearly, 14 minutes and 50 seconds of non-observation is not a good way of preventing suicide in the case of those who are determined. The only way is to maintain eye to eye contact in a hospital ward setting.</P>
    <P>We do not have an adequate psychiatric service for those who are mentally disturbed in our prisons. The Minister's best effort is to provide the equivalent of two full-time psychiatrists for more than 2,600 prisoners. A report published last month by the European CPT commission recommended that in-patient psychiatric services for prisoners be reorganised as a matter of urgency. Fr. Feargal McDonagh, head of prison chaplains, stated that if a prisoner is lucky he will see a psychiatrist for five minutes. That is stretching it. The main function of the psychiatric system is dispensing and prescribing medication, sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. Counselling is non-existent. This is not acceptable. Prisoners identified as disturbed or at risk of suicide are meant to be sent to the Central Mental Hospital. As there is a shortage of beds, prisoners are held in a padded cell, stripped to their underwear with a plastic mattress on the floor and a blanket designed in such a way that it cannot be torn and used as a ligature. They are left to eat their meals off the floor.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the family of Anthony Cawley, the prison governor, staff and prisoners as any suicide is extremely traumatic for the prison.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Neville for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>Anthony Cawley grew into a sad, damaged and dangerous human being because of the effect of circumstances which brutalised his childhood and adolescence to an intolerable degree and included criminal negligence by caring institutions which were supposed to help vulnerable children. Can any person say with absolute certainty, &ldquo;If I was subjected to such an ordeal I would not have become a criminal?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The governor of Wheatfield Prison stated that Anthony Cawley had told him as late as one hour before his death that he was extremely upset about a radio advertisement being run flagging an article in <i>Ireland on Sunday </i>about the alleged most dangerous men in Ireland which would name Cawley. This was on top of the lurid headlines of other tabloids describing this man as a beast and evil incarnate. In whose interest were these articles? In the interest of the innocent woman who suffered appallingly from the violence inflicted by Anthony Cawley? No way. I have no doubt that such articles cause a terrible revisitation of grief and anguish for victims and their families. Were the articles in the interest of <Col N="581" /> the rehabilitation of Anthony Cawley, that from a damaged man he might have become a whole human being, or in the interest of prison staff and the social services which tried to create conditions for his recovery? No way. Such articles are simply about filthy lucre, selling newspapers to make profits and pay the editors and others fat cheques to lead privileged lives. The article in question made a mockery of the newspaper's sanctimonious campaign of a few months previously in which it took on a magazine which was carrying advertisements for activities in which vulnerable women were being put in danger by pimps and others.</P>
    <P>This country has rejected the death penalty for extremely serious crimes. This means that we must look to a situation where people who properly pay severe penalties in terms of imprisonment for their crimes, if released, can play a role in society in a way that is non-threatening to anybody else. This means that the tabloids should lay off and provide space to allow this to happen. Will the Minister outline his thinking on the matter, on possible legislation under which space would be provided for the caring and prison services to lead offenders back to society after they have paid their debt, and on the banning of such lurid articles and their advertisement on radio?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my deep concern at any loss of life in the prisons and particularly death by suicide. Every such death is a tragedy, not just for the family, relatives and friends of the deceased but also for the prison service. I also take the opportunity to extend my sincere sympathy to the family of the deceased, Anthony Cawley. I am aware that these sentiments have also been conveyed to the family by the governor of Wheatfield Place of Detention.</P>
      <P>Anthony Cawley had served his sentence in various institutions. He was transferred to Wheatfield in September 1997 and moved to the segregation unit in October of that year for his protection from other prisoners. He had a long history of self-harm and threatened suicide on a number of occasions. He was under special observation as a result. In view of his special circumstances the governor saw him daily in the segregation unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 10.50 a.m. on Friday, 14 April the Governor visited Anthony Cawley in his cell and discussed a number of issues with him. The Governor again called to see him that afternoon at 3.35 p.m. While he appeared to be in good spirits, he complained about a planned Sunday newspaper article concerning his case. I will return to this point. A little over one hour later at 4.45 p.m. he was found hanging from the window of his cell. He had tied a ligature made from the laces of his shoes around his neck and attached it to a latch on the window. He was cut down immediately. A medical orderly was in the vicinity and com<Col N="582" /> menced CPR and an ambulance was called. The fire brigade ambulance arrived at 5 p.m. and resuscitation commenced. The ambulance left for Tallaght Hospital at 5.30 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 6.02 p.m. in Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal practice the Garda Síochána was informed and its inquiry began immediately. As is usual, this death will be the subject of a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest. The circumstances of the death will also be examined by the suicide awareness group in Wheatfield Place of Detention. I am satisfied that in the circumstances nothing more could have been done to prevent this tragic loss of life. The prison service made ceaseless and unheralded efforts over many years to sustain and assist him. His troubled life has been starkly described in recent days with the focus aimed at his childhood and offences. Beyond this public perception lay a deeply damaged person with special needs which many prison service officials from the highest levels down to the prison officers on the floor tried valiantly to address, no one more so than the present governor of Wheatfield Place of Detention. The reality facing the governor each day was a socially isolated and publicly demonised person with little to live for.</P>
    <P>One claim recently made in the media was that Anthony Cawley was denied entry to the intensive group treatment programme for sex offenders at Arbour Hill Prison. I have to refute this. He was assessed by the expert team which runs the programme but was found unsuited to the group process which the programme entails. He was, however, afforded, exceptional access to other therapeutic services in view of his special needs.</P>
    <P>The preventive measures currently in place to deter suicides are kept under continuous review. The circumstances of each death in custody are examined by the suicide awareness group in each prison. The examinations carried out by these groups cover the background and circumstances of each death. Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken in the future to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature. This is an important mechanism for absorbing the lessons to be learned in each case.</P>
    <P>There are also procedures in place for identifying and monitoring offenders at special risk. Such offenders are usually placed under special observation. However, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is determined to take his or her life the scope for prevention is limited. Suicide is not a completely preventable act in a free society or in a prison system which accords any respect to the personal dignity and privacy of prisoners.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the tragic death of Anthony Cawley I want to address this evening. While nobody would wish to pretend that the <Col N="583" /> offences he committed during his short lifetime were anything other than grave, it is also right to remind ourselves that he too had been seriously victimised, not just in his adult years but when he was a small child and long before the age when he or any other child could comprehend what was meant by a criminal offence, let alone commit one. The young Anthony Cawley, not surprisingly, reacted to the ill treatment experienced in his tender years and later because, like the older Anthony Cawley, he shared one thing in common with all of us &ndash; he was a human being.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that in the tortured days and hours leading up to his decision to end his life he had to cope with being widely described in some media reports, not in terms that we would claim to be the basic right of every human being, but as &ldquo;the beast&rdquo;. How can any fair minded person take seriously the outpourings of some of our more outspoken journalists about the rights of minorities or their admonitions to those of us who try to vindicate and balance competing rights when they apparently see no cause to rail or whimper against their employers and colleagues who saw a seriously damaged and imprisoned human being, at the bottom of the pile and at the end of his tether, being savagely described as &ldquo;the beast&ldquo;?</P>
    <P>My Department has been advised by prison staff that media advertising about promised media pieces in which Anthony Cawley was described as &ldquo;the beast&rdquo; had caused him considerable distress in the days before he died. It is too late now for those who printed the headlines calling Anthony Cawley a beast to tell him they are sorry. However, I am sure every right thinking person in this House and outside it will agree that respect for basic human rights requires that we do not regard the revulsion that may be felt about the crimes committed by any human being, however deep and understandable that revulsion may be, as a permit for describing him or her in language which is appropriate not to a human being but to an animal.</P>
    <P>Anthony Cawley's family deserve an apology from those who described him in bestial terms. The good name of Irish journalism needs to be rescued by one of its number from the depths to which it descended on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me a brief opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment. I tabled this motion as a result of representations by representatives of the voluntary secondary schools in the Dundalk area but the points made apply across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary secondary school sector has <Col N="584" /> made a significant contribution to the overall educational well-being of many people. In the past, when resources were not as plentiful as they are today, schools managed through hard work and fund-raising to provide facilities to educate boys and girls. There is a significant gap between the level of capitation grants provided for voluntary, community, comprehensive and VEC schools. Many parents groups are involved in fund raising for the secondary school sector.</P>
    <P>At a time when significant resources are being invested in education, as in other areas of the economy, it is opportune to examine the level of support for the voluntary secondary school sector. I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Education and Science to increase capitation grants. Perhaps the recommendations of a recent report on this issue should be implemented.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, for coming into the House to respond to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this issue. The Minister for Education and Science recently arranged for the publication of the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools and he has arranged for a copy to be forwarded to Deputy Kirk.</P>
      <P>Traditionally the various sectors within second level education have been funded on the basis of different arrangements. This report represents a comprehensive review of these funding arrangements and is a most valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. As regards current arrangements, voluntary secondary schools receive financial assistance towards their running costs under the terms of the free education scheme. The Department of Education and Science meets the cost of teacher salaries and allowances and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards the recurrent costs of these schools. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of caretakers and secretaries and curricular support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to voluntary secondary schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in our policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium. As the Deputy may be aware, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant for recognised pupils in voluntary secondary schools was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999 with a further increase of £8 planned this year. Assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has also been increased from £25 to £30 per pupil, thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, <Col N="585" /> schools benefited from the IT 2000 initiative and the library books grant.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to draw the Deputy's attention to the Minister's recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September. His approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines that will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities.</P>
    <P>While funding arrangements at second level have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, community, comprehensive and VEC sectors, the Minister is fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and he will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter this evening. I apologise to the Minister of State and to the House for raising this issue on the Adjournment as it relates to only one person. Although I have tried to get answers from the Department of Education and Science, I have not been successful to date. This was the only course of action left open to me.</P>
      <P>This case involves a 24 year old mother with one child who is a constituent of mine. She is currently living with her mother who is on a pension of £80 per week. She has decided to go back to college as a mature student, but she is not receiving the type of State assistance originally identified at the ESF level for trainees in 1999. She falls under the definitions set out in clause 1 of that trainee scheme in that this is an approved course which is an add-on to her existing qualifications and she is a mature student who is over 23 years of age on 1 January. This woman attended a course in Dundalk Institute of Technology some years ago and this is a break from that course. The funding currently available to her is in the order of £679 per year but should be increased to the £1,690 per year full maintenance grant under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This woman has tried to make headway with the Department and County Dublin VEC but feels she is getting nowhere. She believes that the Department misunderstands the essential definition of a mature candidate and an approved course. My last course of action is to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I am grateful to <Col N="586" /> the Minister of State for replying to it. I ask him to again review this case given the set of circumstances which pertain. This woman is 24 years of age and is living with her mother who is on a pension of £80 per week. She is looking for the full benefits of ESF grant funding which would mean an additional £1,000 on top of what she is currently receiving. This is a classic case of the bureaucracy standing in the way of her full justified entitlement and the Minister of State should review this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the student support schemes which the Department of Education and Science funds is the European Social Fund aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees. This scheme applies to those pursuing approved middle level technician or higher technical and business skills courses in institutes of technology. For the purposes of the schemes, mature students are categorised as either mature students dependent on parents or independent mature students. The former is defined as a mature candidate who is ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Maintenance grants may be paid to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who is not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. These students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to their parents' income or address. Under the terms of the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable to eligible students at the adjacent or non-adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases. The position as regards mature students is that, previously, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant as their normal residence was taken to be their address while in attendance at college. With effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, all mature students who qualify for maintenance grants are paid at the higher, non-adjacent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The student in this case lives within 15 miles of Tallaght Institute of Technology which she is attending. I further understand that she pursued a two year course at Dundalk Institute of Technology in the academic year 1994-5 and 1995-6 and did not receive a terminal qualification from this course. She returned to college in the 1998-9 <Col N="587" /> academic year and completed year two of a certificate course in Tallaght Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>In the 1999-2000 academic year she proceeded directly into year three of a diploma course. She has been awarded a maintenance grant under the ESF aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year at the adjacent rate, based on an assessment of her own and her parental income.</P>
    <P>The student maintains that she should be assessed as a mature candidate and should, accordingly, be awarded the higher, non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant. To be assessed as a mature candidate under the scheme to which I referred, a student has to be at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. As the student concerned re-entered the approved course in 1998, before attaining 23 years of age, she cannot be considered as a mature student. In this regard I <Col N="588" /> understand that she attained 23 years of age on 9 June 1998.</P>
    <P>In this instance it is the terms and conditions of the 1994 scheme rather than the 1998 scheme which apply. Her application for a grant was, therefore, correctly assessed by County Dublin VEC under the terms of the 1994 scheme and she was awarded a full maintenance grant at the adjacent rate, based on an assessment of her own and her parental income.</P>
    <P>However, I will ask the Department to look at this case again. In the meantime, if the student has particular financial difficulties she should contact the college authorities to apply for assistance from the ESF aided student assistance/access fund. This fund is intended to tackle educational disadvantage by providing financial support to disadvantaged students who require additional financial support to enable them to fully benefit from their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 April 2000.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the national drugs strategy will be reviewed and evaluated within the lifetime of the programme. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs will, as part of its ongoing work programme, be involved in overseeing the review.</P>
      <P>The objective of the review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them.

It will also examine international trends, developments and best practice models.</P>
      <P>The process of reviewing the strategy has commenced and advertisements inviting submissions from individuals and groups were placed in last Sunday's newspapers, yesterday's daily papers and in local papers in the major urban areas. All State agencies involved in the provision of services in this area will also be requested to make submissions to the review group. In addition, it is intended to hold a number of public consultative fora during June, at dates and locations to be arranged. It is intended to have the review completed by year end.</P>
      <P>The review will have available to it an evaluation of the drugs Initiative by independent consultants including the results of individual evaluations of nearly 150 local drugs task force projects currently under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 51 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The local drugs task forces were set up in disadvantaged areas experiencing the highest levels of illicit drug use, particularly heroin abuse. While the use of illicit drugs is a nationwide phenomenon, heroin abuse presents particular problems because of its public health implications and close association with crime.</P>
      <P>In determining the designation of the task force areas, therefore, the focus has been on those areas which have a high incidence of heroin abuse. The criteria used for determining such areas are: drug treatment data from the health services; Garda crime statistics; data relating to school attendance-drop-out; and other relevant data on the levels of social and economic disadvantage in the area. Based on these criteria, there are 14 local drugs task forces in existence. In addition, a number of health boards have regional co-ordinating committees for their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the young people's facilities and services fund, the Government has allocated in excess of £35 million over three years to support over 350 projects as part of area-based strategies and national initiatives in the area of drug prevention. This fund is aimed at diverting &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people away from drug use into more healthy and productive pursuits. While the main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas, funding was also earmarked to support locally developed drug prevention strategies in the urban areas of south Cork city, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Bray and Carlow. These areas were identified as areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. Recog<Col N="591" /> nising the need to tackle drug misuse on a national basis, funding was also allocated under the fund to seven nationwide initiatives which are designed to inform and raise awareness of the dangers of drug misuse, particularly through peer education.</P>
    <P>In addition, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 commits significant levels of funding towards drug prevention measures in both the south east and the BMW regions.</P>
    <P>This funding will be targeted at interventions aimed at young people who are involved or at risk of becoming involved in drug misuse. It will offer these &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people alternatives to substance abuse through the development of facilities, programmes and services relevant to their needs.</P>
    <P>The type of actions envisaged include activities and educational programmes for young people who have traditionally found themselves outside the scope of mainstream youth work, due either to their family circumstances, involvement with crime or drugs, or their lack of formal education. The plan will also provide community-based prevention programmes, such as early school leaving projects, the development of sports or leisure facilities and activities, family support programmes, along with other recreational activities such as art, drama and music. The detailed measures within the plan which will provide for drug prevention and education initiatives are currently being finalised with the Department of Finance. An overall review of the overall national drugs strategy is now under way. Its objective is to review the current strategy, identify any gaps or deficiencies and develop revised policies and, if necessary, arrangements through which to deliver them.</P>
    <P>A key element of this review will be to identify the areas with the highest levels of drug misuse, based on the best available data on drug misuse throughout the country as a whole. The review will take account of the measures being undertaken to tackle drug misuse and the adequacy of these responses in the light of emerging trends in drug misuse nationally, with a view to making recommendations to Government on future drugs policy.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme operated by my Department provides financial assistance to voluntary and community organis<Col N="592" /> ations, including sporting organisations, towards the development of sport and recreation facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 sports capital programme grants totalling £5.093 million were allocated to 53 projects in the Dublin area of which grants totalling £0.762 million were allocated to 12 projects in the Dublin 3, 5 and 9 areas.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was advertised in early December 1999, with a closing date of 11 February 2000 for the receipt of completed applications. More than 1,600 applications were received and the initial processing of these has been completed.</P>
      <P>All of the applications received under the programme will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form and I hope to be in a position to announce the grant allocations by June 2000. Until such time as the evaluation of the applications has been completed, I am not in a position to say what projects in the Dublin 3, 5 and 9 will be allocated funding.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government set up the young people's facilities and services fund in 1998 as part of its national drugs strategy, to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The three-year fund aims to attract young people in those areas at risk of becoming involved in drugs into more healthy and productive pursuits. An Exchequer contribution of £34.8 million has been allocated over a three year period, 1999 &ndash; 2001, for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas, of which 12 are located in Dublin. Parts of Dublin 3 and 5 postal districts are covered by the North Inner City Task Force and the Dublin North East Task Force areas respectively. In April 1999, the Government allocated over £25 million to support 295 facility and services projects in these areas over the next three years. Of this amount £22 million was allocated to 268 individual projects in Dublin, including £994,000 to support eight facility projects the North Inner City Task Force area and £803,000 to support eight facility projects in the Dublin North East. Details of these projects have already been provided to the Deputy on foot of a previous parliamentary question.</P>

    <P>In 1999 my Department commissioned the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management to prepare a report on the present condition of local authority pools constructed between 1966 and 1981. Some 30 pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment of which seven are in the Dublin Corporation area. I have secured funding of £45 million for the swimming pool programme for three years commencing in 2000 and my Department has invited proposals to refurbish the pools identified by ILAM, from the local authorities responsible for each pool. To date, no proposal has been submit<Col N="593" /> ted in respect of the pools in Dublin 3, 5 and 9 areas.</P>

      <P>The effectiveness of Bord Fáilte's marketing activities is monitored by my Department, particularly against achievement of national tourism targets which are set in terms of overseas visitor revenue, number of jobs created and seasonal and regional distribution of tourism revenue. Under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 both revenue and jobs targets were well exceeded while progress was made towards increasing the proportion of visitors arriving in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.</P>
      <P>In carrying out its core function of selling Ireland overseas as a tourism destination, Bord Fáilte utilises a wide range of marketing communication tools.</P>
      <P>These include &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; activities such as TV-Radio-Press-Print and Internet advertising and what are termed &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; activities which include direct marketing, trade, media and consumer promotions and the production and dissemination of tourism promotional material.</P>
      <P>The amount of moneys allocated to various marketing activities &ndash; including trade promotions &ndash; is an operational matter for Bord Fáilte. However, I understand from Bord Fáilte that there is a significant degree of industry participation in overseas trade promotions and that workshops, in particular, are almost entirely financed by participants for whose benefit they are organised by the board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as tourism policy is concerned, cycling is a significant niche tourism activity. According to Bord Fáilte estimates, which are based on three year averages, 158,000 overseas visitors come to Ireland annually to enjoy a cycling <Col N="594" /> holiday, mostly in a rural setting. There are now some 100 tourism operators offering either bike rental, cycling holidays, unguided cycle routes or guided cycle tours. In addition to the promotion of cycling packages, the tourism development agencies have also been active in encouraging designation, and signposting, of cycling routes which incorporate a high degree of access to a mix of facilities such as accommodation, food, and attractions along the way, a number of which offer secure and sheltered parking for their cycling visitors.</P>
    <P>Tourism strategy under the new national development plan will continue to promote this approach to the ongoing development of our tourist cycling product.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 57 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was advertised in early December 1999 with a closing date of 11 February 2000 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,600 applications were received and the initial processing of these applications has been completed.</P>
      <P>Applications received under the programme will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. While all applications will be treated on their merits, the highest priority will be afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people.</P>
      <P>Each application will be assessed on the basis of the published criteria, but this year I intend to make a minimum of £200,000 available for allocation to each county, subject to the requirement that applications for funding from suitable projects, which meet my Department's criteria, have been submitted from each county. I believe this new approach will ensure a more equitable spread of funding between counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 264 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1989, the Irish tourism industry has benefited from a very substantial round of capital investment, undertaken with the support of the 1989-93 and 1994-99 EU.</P>
      <P>Co-Funded Operational Programmes for Tourism. This investment, totalling £739 million, has assisted in the upgrading of existing facilities and the addition of new ones, and has been across a wide range of facilities, whose existence has assisted in no small way in the growth and maintenance of visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, an impressive expansion of tourist accommodation over the same period has resulted in increased competition and higher standards across all categories.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that levels and standards of facilities in the tourism industry have improved, there is no room for complacency. That is why, in my discussions with the industry, I continue to emphasise the need for maintaining high standards in order to meet the needs of our discerning overseas visitors.</P>
      <P>To ensure that our tourism product continues to keep pace with, if not ahead, of our international competitors, I have secured some £100 million under the national development plan for tourism product development over the next seven years. This will be allocated under the two regional operational programmes. These two programmes also include funds under the aegis of other Ministers for areas such as marine leisure, angling and rural tourism, which will benefit the sector, while expenditure in the cultural development and micro-enterprise areas will also support the development of tourism product. The strategy for tourism product development, under the programmes will be based on the needs of areas, having regard to whether they are developed, developing or undeveloped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main priorities for funding will be to support investment in a small number strategically-located major new attractions where none currently exist, and also in the packaging, presentation and, where necessary, completion of a limited number of significant clusters of attractions in less developed tourist areas which have the <Col N="596" /> potential to generate greater foreign tourism revenue and stimulate private investment in the provision of further tourist services.</P>
    <P>However, tourism cannot be developed in isolation. Investment in non-national roads, rural water, waste management and litter control are essential to the strategy of facilitating the expansion of tourism into more remote areas and maintaining a sustainable tourism product in more developed areas. If the relevant local and other authorities do not deliver the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls, it will be difficult to successfully realise our national tourism strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I have already addressed the issues raised in a previous question.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006, has now been published and includes an outline of the Government's proposals for the development of the tourism industry over that period. Under the plan, I have succeeded in obtaining in excess of £350 million specifically for tourism marketing, product development and training over the next seven years.</P>
      <P>The plan provides for two regional operational programmes, one for the border, midlands and western region and one for the southern and eastern region. The £100 million, which I have obtained for development of tourism product, will be delivered under these programmes. These programmes will also include funds under the aegis of other Ministers in areas such as marine leisure, angling and rural tourism, while expenditure in the cultural development and micro-enterprise areas will also support the development of tourism product.</P>
      <P>My Department is negotiating with the Department of Finance in relation to the tourism content of these programmes. The programmes will have to be agreed by the regional assemblies and forwarded to Brussels. It will take another few months for Brussels to sign off on the OPs. It is possible, that it may be into the autumn before all the relevant structures are put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> As the OPs are under negotiation, Deputies will understand that I cannot go into too much detail in relation to their possible content. Nevertheless, I think that I have made it plain on more than one occasion that the focus should be on the creation of a small number of strategically located major attractions in areas where such do not already exist, the clustering of existing smaller scale attractions and the development of special interest activities especially those involving a combination of outdoor pursuits such as cycling, walking and horse riding as well as developing activities for disabled visitors.</P>
    <P>As the NDP indicates, the bias of tourism product spend will be towards those areas which are less developed in tourism terms. Strengthening these areas will be part of the strategy to distribute the benefits of tourism more widely.</P>
    <P>As far as decision-making structures are concerned, I have proposed a continuation of the independent product management board model, one for each region, which worked well during the lifetime of the last tourism operational programme. However, delivery mechanisms and institutional arrangements for the OPs are still under consideration.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a thorough awareness and information campaign by the relevant tourism bodies, and I also envisage that there will be competition for the product development funds. Bearing that in mind, I think that it would be unrealistic to expect major product decisions before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As soon as details of the OPs are agreed with the regional assemblies and the European Commission, all the regional tourism authorities will be given full details of the type of product eligible for support under the plan and asked to embark on an information and awareness-creating drive in their regions.</P>

      <P>The regional tourism authorities were established by Bord Fáilte, under the Tourist Traffic Acts, for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis. In line with the commitment set out in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, Bord Fáilte initiated a review of the RTAs during 1999. The objective of the review is to ensure that RTAs are positioned to make the optimum contribution to the realisation of national tourism objectives and targets set by Government while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus. In the context of the review, a report on the RTAs was commissioned by BFE from Fitzpatrick Associates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the review will help to achieve an improved delineation of RTA functions and <Col N="598" /> objectives within overall State tourism architecture. Discussions are currently nearing conclusion between officials from my Department and Bord Fáilte on issues arising from the review process, and should be completed by early May. Once these discussions have been finalised, I expect that Bord Fáilte will call a meeting of representatives of the RTAs with a view to informing them of the outcome of the review and setting out their vision for future RTAs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>While ministerial responsibility for the litter issue lies with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have consistently drawn public attention to the fact that litter can have a negative impact on our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Preliminary results from Bord Fáilte's visitor attitude surveys for 1999 show a significant increase in the number of overseas visitors mentioning litter as an aspect of an Irish holiday they found to be either unsatisfactory or in need of improvement. Overall, whereas expectations of overseas holidaymakers were either matched or exceeded in over 90% of cases, amongst the minority for whom their expectations were not met, litter was mentioned by 12% last year compared to 8% in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Litter Pollution Act is now being implemented in an increasingly proactive fashion by an increasing number of local authorities. I welcome the fact that the Minister has established a national anti-litter forum and that the forum is expected to issue its report in the next month or so outlining strategies to combat litter. Bord Failte is represented on the forum. I expect publication of the forum's report will result in widespread public debate on how best to resolve our litter problem, which is essentially an issue for every citizen in the State.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to assist in developing strategies, there are two pilot projects, one in Waterford and one in Tipperary, under the Tourism and the Environment Pilot Initiative, funded for the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 aimed specifically at developing models on how to effectively tackle the litter problem. The final reports on the projects are due for completion over the next few months and I hope that we can learn lessons from these projects which will have wider application.</P>

      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, decided in November 1997, to initiate a tender procedure inviting proposals for the design, financing, construction and management of a national 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
      <P>This tender procedure, which was conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, culminated, in July last year, with the selection of a proposal submitted by the University of Limerick to develop a 50 metre swimming pool on their campus.</P>
      <P>The University's proposal is based on receiving a capital grant of £5.95 million and an operational subsidy of £190,000 per annum for 20 years. The swimming pool will form part of the University's multi-purpose sports building project, which is currently under construction, and is located close to the national coaching and training centre. The university expect that the pool will be operational early in 2001.</P>
      <P>As the award of the grant to develop the swimming pool was made following an open tender procedure, clearly it would be inappropriate for my Department to consider the offer of grant-aid to an unsuccessful tenderer.</P>

      <P>Under the 1998 sports capital programme, grants totalling £5.95 million were allocated to 246 clubs and organisations throughout the country. Of this total £3.265 million was allocated to 34 major facilities while £2.685 was allocated to 212 recreational facilities. In the case of the major facilities the grantees were given until 31 December 2000 to draw down the grants while the projects assisted under the recreational facilities were to have drawn down the grants by 30 June 1999.</P>
      <P>All of the projects which were grant assisted under the 1998 programme and which have not yet drawn down the grants have been contacted and advised by my Department that these grants will be withdrawn unless the necessary documentation required to draw down the grant is submitted without further delay. As many of the replies are still outstanding, the specific information sought by the Deputy as to the number and value of these projects and scope, if appropriate, for reallocation is not readily available.</P>
      <P>Outstanding commitments under the programme stood at almost £29 million at the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>The development and promotion of sport is primarily a matter for the particular governing body. In this case, the governing bodies concerned are the Golfing Union of Ireland and the Irish Ladies' Golfing Union and both organisations are supported by the Irish Sports Council on an annual basis towards the costs associated with the development and promotion of the sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Team Ireland Golf Trust was set up last September to assist high performing young Irish golfers in the early stages of their golfing career. The trust is designed to provide financial and non-financial support to selected young golfers to help them qualify for tour cards <Col N="603" /> and achieve success at international level. With an initial fund of £190,000 per annum for three years, including significant private sector contributions, the trust is administered by the Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>The 18 young golfers who will benefit under the trust in 2000 were announced in January. Along with cash grants, non-financial support will be provided in the form of access to a range of sports science and medical services which are co-ordinated through the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Proposals in relation to establishment of a golf academy would be a matter for the Irish Sports Council, who would have to take into account a range of factors including the current role of, and levels of assistance to, the respective golfing associations and Team Ireland Golf Trust.</P>

      <P>The national development plan, published in November 1999, included a specific allocation of £150 million for a tourism marketing sub-programme over the period 2000 to 2006. The marketing sub-programme consists of two measures, a destination marketing measure and a niche marketing measure, to be funded from Ireland's first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund. The main purpose of this fund is to finance the promotion and marketing internationally of Ireland as a tourism destination. Details of the activities envisaged are set out in paragraphs 6.97-6.100 of the national development plan. Management of the fund will incorporate a partnership arrangement, details of which are currently being finalised with Bord Fáilte and representatives of the tourism industry, and which I hope to announce shortly.</P>
      <P>The first annual allocation under the fund has been incorporated in my Department's year 2000 Estimates &ndash; a provision of £14.4 million under a new subhead B.11.</P>

      <P>The remarks by the chairperson of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation were made in the context of the recent launch of the interim results of the People and Place project, at which I was present.</P>
      <P>The People and Place project, being led by ITIC with support from OTMI, Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourism Board and CERT, is being funded under the tourism and the environment initiative of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999. The project aims to raise awareness both within the tourism industry and among the public of the need to preserve what ITIC call the &ldquo;core values&rdquo; of Irish tourism &ndash; the friendliness of the Irish people and the unspoilt natural environment.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse the comments by the ITIC chairperson, which were made as a constructive and timely contribution to the successful implementation of the project. ITIC has made a significant effort in bringing together the level of commitment from within the tourism industry itself which will be necessary to ensure that Irish tourism is truly sustainable. I commend its initiative and eagerness in seeking to explore and identify ways of retaining and improving the welcoming environment, both social and physical, offered to our tourists. In the final analysis, it will be the tourism industry itself which must generate the momentum necessary to ensure that, in the context of increasing tourism numbers, the uniquely Irish tourism experience remains so.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, included provision for 33 million ECU, £26 million, in European Regional Development Fund grant aid for the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
      <P>A tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent management board for product development, and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, was launched in September 1997 and culminated, in June 1998, in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, to go forward for grant-aid to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's docklands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> Following a submission by the Government, the EU Commission, in November 1998, gave its approval, in principle, for a grant of 33 million ECU to the project with drawdown subject to resolution of an outstanding procedural complaint and the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules.</P>
    <P>The Commission closed its file on the procedural complaint in April 1999.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1999, as negotiations between the various parties moved nearer to the end-year deadline for entering legally binding commitments under the operational programme, the Government, after consultation with the Commission, secured agreement by the relevant monitoring committees that the grant of £26 million for the conference centre project would be financed from an increase in Exchequer non co-financed funds to the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-1999 in order to facilitate completion of the public procurement process, and avoid any possible risk of loss of European Regional Development Fund funds to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having received confirmation from the Commission on permissible time limits for the grant drawdown, contract documentation was agreed by Bord Fáilte and the developers by end-December 1999.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance and the Commission are still in correspondence on the taxation issues and related matters. Meanwhile, planning permission for the conference centre, and decisions regarding related developments, which was issued by Dublin Corporation in August last year, is under appeal and an oral hearing has recently concluded. An Bord Pleanála has indicated that it expects to have a decision before July this year, at the latest.</P>

      <P>Persons usually resident in Great Britain, that is, excluding Northern Ireland, comprised the largest number, 3,383.000, of overseas visits to Ireland in 1998. The estimated total expenditure on these visits was £732 million, which amounts to about £216 per visit.</P>
      <P>In 1998, overseas visits to Ireland were classified by &ldquo;reason for journey&rdquo; into business; tourist; visits to friends and relatives; and other. This categorisation was changed in 1999. The &ldquo;tourist&rdquo; category of visits had the largest expenditure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the economic, social and cultural contribution of community groups, the National Millennium Committee allocated £3 million of millennium funding under the millennium recognition awards for locally based projects. These awards were administered by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of the National Millennium Committee. The application from the Genealogical Society of Ireland was submitted directly to Area Development Management Limited under the title Cumann Geinealais Dhun Laoghaire to be considered for <Col N="607" /> funding under the millennium recognition awards.</P>
    <P>A number of criteria were applied under the millennium recognition awards, including evidence of local support, evidence of local need, capacity of the group to implement the proposal within a reasonable timescale, evidence of financial control procedures within the group, a link to the millennium and the overall quality of the proposal. As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, with a very large response to the awards and only a limited fund available, not all projects could be funded. Out of the 1,400 applications received nearly 200 projects were recommended by the National Millennium Committee for awards. Unfortunately, the Genealogical Society of Ireland was not among them.</P>

      <P>My Department's statement of strategy recognises the need for the development and adoption of new communications and information technologies to meet a higher level of customer expectation and the need for greater efficiency in services, improved service delivery and increased efficiency. To this end, an IT strategy plan is in place in my Department which identifies the technologies and applications required to support the Department's core business.</P>
      <P>As part of this IT strategy plan, my Department's IT unit was expanded and restructured in late 1999. This restructuring led to the establishment of an IT systems development team. The team comprises one higher executive officer, one executive officer, one staff officer and one clerical officer. A training programme is in place to allow the team to constantly upgrade its IT skills. In addition, any expertise required that the Department does not possess and cannot readily acquire will be outsourced, either to the Centre for Management Organisation and Development in the Department of Finance or, if necessary, the private sector.</P>
      <P>The team is, and will be, undertaking a number of projects to develop information and communications technology, ICT, systems in 2000. ICT systems currently in place or under development in my Department aim to make information more easily accessible to all our customers &ndash; internal, interdepartmental and the general public. The specific projects are as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety. Under the 1989 Act, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority. I suggest that the Deputy bring his concerns to the direct attention of the Health and Safety Authority at Odeon House, Eyre Square, Galway. In the meantime, I have arranged for the details contained in the Deputy's question to be brought to the attention of the authority.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the health and safety of both workers and patients, lies in the first instance with the relevant hospital authorities.</P>

      <P>Ireland's system of export controls for both military and dual-use items fully respect our obligations under various international fora. The list of items contained in the control of exports order, 1996, reflects the list of military goods which, within the framework of the Wassenaar Arrangement, were agreed should be controlled. The purpose of the Wassenaar Arrangement is to contribute to regional and international security and stability, by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies. In this regard, entry No. 5 of the order, fire control equipment, covers items intended for use in the context of controlling the firing of munitions equipment.</P>
      <P>An end-use certificate is required for all military goods exported outside the European Union and for certain dual-use goods, depending on their sensitivity and/or country of final destination. An international import certificate is required for the transfer of military goods to another EU country. Details of licences granted by my Department in respect of military and dual-use goods are available on the Department's website &ndash;<i>www.entemp.ie/export/default.htm.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>At a recent Government meeting approval was granted for the establishment of a single port company in the Shannon Estuary to replace the two existing port companies of Shannon Estuary Ports Company and Foynes Port Company. Authorisation was also given to the <Col N="615" /> drafting of a Bill, amending the Harbours Act, 1996, on a priority basis. My Department and the Attorney General's office are now proceeding with the drafting of the Bill as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>The benefits which will arise from this initiative include,<i> inter alia,</i> the provision of a single, coherent voice in the marketing of the estuary ports by a more focused management, greater efficiencies and economies of scale allowing a more structured approach to infrastructural development as well as a more rational approach to the best use of terminals and assets.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Estuary is a national asset, which because of its length, width and deep water, has the potential capability, unique in Ireland, to handle major transhipment business and be an international turntable for transatlantic and European seaborne trade. The proposal to use the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank as a location for a container transhipment facility has been around for some time and I am determined that it be urgently and authoritatively explored.</P>
      <P>On foot of this, a meeting was held on 31 March 2000 under the auspices of my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach at which other Government Departments, port companies and development agencies in the Shannon area were represented. The meeting agreed that while success is dependent on investment from the private sector, the project warrants further exploration. Shannon Development was tasked with the responsibility to develop the concept in outline form and to explore this informally with potential operators. This will take three to four months to complete.</P>

It appears from files lodged in the records branch of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that a number of tenants were involved and that the sporting rights within the meaning of the Irish Land Act, 1903, to which the vendor was entitled over and upon the holding had been leased by the vendor to another party for 21 years from February 1904. The agreement for sale between the vendor and tenants states that these rights shall be vested in the tenants on the expiration of this lease. This agreement also states: &ldquo;The rights of all parties in the waters of the River Owenmore are to be preserved as they at present exist&rdquo;.

      <Col N="618" /> The total expenditure to date is £856,588 and the balance of £17,012 must be claimed before 31 December 2000 in accordance with the rules for the tourism operational programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funds available under TAM, the Central Fisheries Board informs me that the unit has generated additional funding by providing services to other parties.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, a figure of £24 million has been allocated to the angling sector. It is expected that the angling measure within the plan will be in place later this year at which point it will be open to the central board to apply for funding for services to be carried out by the unit.</P>

      <P>My Department does not carry out systems development in-house and, consequently, does not employ persons qualified to develop ICT systems. The existing IT staff resource in the Department, who engage in continuous training and updating of technical skills, are engaged primarily on network administration and technical support.</P>
      <P>The Department has advanced strategy and development plans for information technology, IT, the aim of which is to meet the requirements of electronic Government. The IT strategy plan outlines the key strategies for the Department's information needs, software applications, technical architecture, IT management, human resources and quality of services. A three-year IT development plan is being finalised to achieve the goals identified in the strategy. The plan identifies a number of projects which, together with ongoing developments, aim to deploy appropriate technology to provide for modern communications based on internet technologies.</P>
      <P>The successful implementation of the plan is dependent on the provision of additional resources. Negotiations are currently under way between my Department and the Department of Finance in this regard.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 92 of 4 April 2000, there are a number of vessels in the polyvalent segment of the Irish fishing fleet which are not precluded by the terms of their sea fishing boat licences from fishing by means of beam trawls, or which are permitted to engage in beam trawling for a proportion of their fishing time. As I have explained in my earlier reply, quantification of the number of vessels involved is under way by my Department as part of a comprehensive analysis of beam trawl entitlements within the polyvalent segment. The aim is to have this analysis completed by mid year and I will revert to the Deputy with the information requested when it is available.</P>

      <P>The Government has yet to decide on an appropriate regulatory model for the bus market in the greater Dublin area, having considered the review prepared by my Department. It would, therefore, be inappropriate and premature for me to respond to a speculative question which presumes acceptance of a particular regulatory model. However, I can say that none of the submissions made in response to the review contained any suggestion that buses already acquired by Bus Átha Cliath with State financial support should be given to competitors in the event of routes being opened to competitive tendering. However, some did suggest that both pub<Col N="620" /> lic and private operators should have access to public capital funding for buses on an equal basis.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the CIÉ superannuation schemes restructuring proposals. The proposals have been agreed with the trade unions representing the schemes' members. They have also been considered by my <Col N="621" /> Department and by the Department of Finance and have been subject to a consultation period of 28 days which was designed to allow for objections or representations to be made to me on the proposed changes.</P>
      <P>There were no objections to the proposed changes and following discussions with the Attorney General's office, my Department is preparing a statutory instrument to confirm the proposals. My Department is currently awaiting certain information from CIE before it can finalise the statutory instrument.</P>
      <P>The utilisation of the schemes' surplus covers, among other things, provisions for the amalgamation of the individual scheme funds into a single fund. In addition, any post retirement increases will be payable from the fund.</P>
      <P>The proposals also provide for the following improvements for the members of the 1951 CIE superannuation scheme: an increase in the accrual rate for capital sums purposes from 1/30th of pensionable salary to 3/80ths of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable membership maximum 120/80ths; the existing limit of £2,000 which may be paid out of the scheme fund, at the board's discretion, to the personal representative of a deceased member, where grant of probate has not been taken out, has been increased to £6,000; persons who retire due to ill health with at least ten years pensionable membership, excluding notional pensionable membership, will have an additional period of ill health service added to their pensionable membership.</P>

This study is now being examined with a view to identifying priority projects including suburban rail stations. At this time, my expectation is that Lucan south and Intel will be the first stations to be completed. Their planning and construction will take about three years.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): The person named was excluded from payment under the 1993 and 1994 special beef premium schemes due to non-compliance with the regulations of the 1993 scheme. Special beef premium and BSE compensation scheme payments totalling £10,955.50 had already issued on foot of 1993 and 1994 applications and these monies fell due to be recouped from future payments due. These overpayments have now been refunded to the Department by means of systematic recovery from premia payments due.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development </P>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): Following an inspection of the farm of the person named in April 1997 penalties of 110% were imposed in respect of the infilling of a watercourse and for failing to spread lime as required in his agri-environmental plan. As the penalty amounted to 100% or more, the scheme conditions at the time required that the applicant's participation in REPS be terminated and that he refund all payments received. In accordance with the procedures for appeal, the applicant first appealed the penalties to his local departmental office. This appeal was unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>The applicant further appealed the decision to my Department's REPS appeals committee. The matter was examined by the committee which decided to uphold the penalty and the applicant was informed of the decision in February 1998. Subsequently, the applicant contacted the office of the Ombudsman, and at that office's request the matter was reviewed by the appeals committee. In this review, no substantial issues were found which warranted a change of the original decision.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the applicant has had every opportunity to present his case for review and appeal and that my Department has examined the matter thoroughly and fairly before arriving at its decision.</P>

      <P>One of the parcels claimed by the person named in his 1999 area aid application overlapped with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. The person named was contacted in this regard and in his reply clarified the position by including a map showing the correct position. This information has now been entered on to the Department's electronic database, and his application is clear for payment based on the full 10.50 hectares he included in his application.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium in respect of four animals in 1999. Advance payment of 60% issued to him on 1 November 1999 totalling £205.46. He was also an applicant under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme, and an advance payment of 60% amounting to £399.42, in respect of five suckler cows, was made to him on 1 November 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a problem arose in relation to his area aid application, these advances were deemed to have been overpaid and were subsequently recovered from headage payments, £24 from his 1999 sheep headage and £580.88 from his 1999 cattle headage. Now that his area aid application has <Col N="626" /> been cleared, my Department refunded £399.42 on 30 March 2000 and the balance will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>This estate was a tenanted estate which was sold by the owner to the tenants in June 1905 with the Irish Land Commission providing the necessary finance. It appears from files lodged in the records branch of my Department that a number of tenants were involved and that the sporting rights within the meaning of the Irish Land Act, 1903, to which the vendor was entitled over and upon the holding had been leased by the vendor to another party for 21 years from February 1904. The agreement for sale between the vendor and tenants states that these rights shall be vested in the tenants on the expiration of this lease. This agreement also states: &ldquo;The rights of all parties in the waters of the River Owenmore are to be preserved as they at present exist&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The present position would appear to be a matter between the individuals concerned and the Land Registry office.</P>

      <P>The amended map which the person named presented to the area aid unit has now been entered on to the Department's electronic database.</P>
      <P>The person named claimed a total of 23.36 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 22.71 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.65 hectares or 2.86 % between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in this case no penalty is applied, leaving the area for payment purposes at 22.71 hectares. Any payments due have issued based on this area.</P>
      <P>The person named received his full entitlements under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme and the 1999 special beef premium scheme. Under the 1999 cattle headage scheme his full entitlement was £1,081.20. However, he received a reduced payment of £1,030.94 on 3 November 1999 based on 17.69 hectares and I have now arranged a balancing payment of £50.26 to be made to him within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>The eligibility criteria for the allocation to producers of the additional 20.5 million gallons of milk quota negotiated under Agenda 2000 were set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999. Some 15 million gallons will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. A further five million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the <Col N="630" /> allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect.</P>

      <P>In 1999 the person named was paid £608.81 under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme, £1,164.14 under the 1999 ewe premium scheme, £1,321.00 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and £814.00 under the 1999 sheep headage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to introduce a moratorium on payments of land annuities. Inspectors from my Department have visited and will continue to visit farmers with arrears with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment. If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period. On the other hand, if it is found that there is no good reason for non-payment of annuities, my Department will have to consider offsetting of headage and premium payments and taking legal action in the matter. Notwithstanding that the half yearly instalment of land purchase annuity payable by the person named is £229.00, he had arrears of £2,906 at the end of 1999. Following a visit by one of my Department's inspectors in 1997 to ascertain the reason for non-payment, he was written to and offered an opportunity to clear the arrears over a two year period. As this offer was not accepted, he was written to again in July 1999 and informed that if a substantial payment was not made the Department would have to recover the arrears by offsetting headage and premium payments that would be due to him. <Col N="631" /> As there was no response to this letter my Department has offset the following payments that were due to him:</P>

      <P>I am aware of the representations made by Compassion in World Farming on the calf export trade. As I pointed out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 155 of 5 April 2000, the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Orders, 1995 and 1997, prescribe strict standards for feeding, watering, resting periods, journey times and stocking densities to safeguard the welfare of animals, including calves, during transportation. Additionally, the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Orders, 1996 and 1998, lay down rules for the carriage of cattle by sea from the State. The latter orders provide for the inspection and approval of cattle vessels which comply with specified criteria, the loading and care of cattle on vessels, conditions in relation to weather and the submission of voyage reports. Veterinary inspectors of my Department monitor compliance with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The export of calves is a legitimate trade within the European Union. Member states are precluded by EU rules from taking any steps to restrict the export of calves to other member states. Provided that calf consignments comply with the requirements of veterinary certification and of the foregoing legislation, there can be no prohibition on exports. The treatment of calves <Col N="633" /> in a member state is a matter for the authorities of that state.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): Payments of the 1999 suckler cow premium and the final instalment of the 1999 ewe premium were made to the person named on 2 March 2000.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 1999 cattle and sheep headage schemes the position is as stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 56 of 2 March 2000, that is, applicants are required to submit their RSI number with their application form if grants claimed exceed £500. The person named claimed grants in excess of £500 but did not submit his RSI number with his applications. Although he was written to in this regard on 3 February 1999 he has not responded to date.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a special beef premium grant was not paid to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; the reason his Department was not in a position to confirm that this person was not eligible; the reason his Department stamped the cards when this person was not entitled to the grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person named submitted an area aid application declaring a forage area of 49 hectares in 1999. This gave him a stocking limit for premium purposes of 98 livestock units. Of the 98 livestock units, 84.09 livestock units were accounted for by his milk quota. This left a maximum of 13.91 livestock units on which payment of premium could be made.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium in respect of a total of 46 animals over six applications in 1999. The animals on the six applications constituted 28.4 livestock units. Advance payment has been made to the maximum entitlement of the applicant of 13.91 livestock units.</P>
      <P>Once each application was processed, a statement was issued to the person named informing him of the status of the application, including the livestock unit value of each animal. In addition, the person named was informed in writing on 27 March 2000 of the reason for non-payment of premium.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the EU regulations governing the scheme, animals applied on in excess of the applicant's stocking density limit are deemed to have received the age category of premium applied for and are not eligible for payment of that category of premium subsequently. Therefore, the cattle passports are correctly stamped and correctly reflect the premium status of the animals concerned.</P>

      <P>The herd number referred to is registered in the name of the mother of the person named and it is in her name that the area aid application under the 1999 scheme was submitted.</P>
      <P>The area aid applicant claimed a half share of a commonage parcel as part of her 1999 area aid application amounting to 24.26 hectares. She was requested by the area aid unit to provide proof of entitlement to this amount of commonage but did not produce sufficient documentary proof to support her claim.</P>
      <P>However, in order to process this application my Department will take account of information provided on behalf of the applicant by Donegal County Council and on this basis my Department is prepared to give the applicant the benefit of 3.46 hectares of commonage, an area equivalent to a 4/56th share.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the area on the application has been adjusted downwards without penalty. The total area on which area aid payments will, therefore, be calculated is 7.63 hectares. Any payments due will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>At present, there is a full stamp duty relief for young trained farmers on transfers of any type of agricultural land. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, this relief was increased from a two-thirds relief to a full relief in the Finance Act, 2000, for three years until 31 December 2002.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the relief a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is one who is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; and is the holder of one of the specified qualifications, e.g. the Teagasc certificate in farming; or if born before 1 January 1968, has three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours duration.</P>
      <P>Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he-she may obtain the relief by way of a refund, provided that the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.</P>
      <P>The aim of this relief is to promote lifetime transfers of land and encourage more young people to pursue farming. This is a very generous relief and cannot be availed of by any other sector. I have no plans to extend the full stamp duty relief beyond the current scheme.</P>

      <P>Since 21 April 1998, when the Freedom of Information, FOI, Act commenced for Departments and related public bodies, its scope has been extended incrementally; first, to health boards and local authorities and subsequently to voluntary hospitals and to certain publicly funded voluntary bodies providing services to people with intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of extending FOI across the wider public service in an incremental fashion as experience is gained in its application continued in July 1999, when the Government decided to extend the scope of the Act further over the subsequent 24 months to certain other bodies in the areas of broadcasting, social services, health, culture, environment, regulation, enterprise and education. The first phase of this extension is due to take place on 1 May 2000 when RTE and TG4 are scheduled to be brought within the scope of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Government decision of July last did not encompass the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Changes to the membership, remit and procedures pertaining to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are being contemplated in the context of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999. These include a restructuring of the membership of the commission to bring it in line with the structures which apply to RTE in respect of numbers and gender balance, an extension of the remit for the commission to include all broadcasters operating services under contracts entered into by the Independent Radio and Television Commission under the Bill and breaches of code developed by the Independent Radio and Television Commission and a change in procedures to allow a person complain directly to the commission.</P>
      <P>The question of including a restructured Broadcasting Complaints Commission in future extensions of the FOI Act will be considered in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU sixth VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.</P>
      <P>Electricity is subject to VAT at the 12.5% rate and, in this regard, Ireland avails of certain options for reduced rating contained in EU VAT law. Telephone bills are standard rated at 21%. It is not open to me to zero rate the supply of such services and these rates must apply regardless of the user of the service.</P>
      <P>I should say that for those people in receipt of the free telephone rental allowance, this covers the normal two-monthly telephone instrument and line rental charges for a standard telephone and also provides up to 20 free call units in each two-monthly billing period. For those in receipt of the free electricity allowance, this covers the normal standing charge and provides 1,500 free units, i.e. 200 units per two monthly billing period in the summer and 300 units per two monthly period in the winter. In addition, it is possible to use the £5 fuel allowance, which is payable from October to April, to cover electricity charges. For those in receipt of free telephone rental allowance and electricity, the VAT is borne by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>There were 50,000 copies of the Budget 2000 newspaper produced. The total cost of the publication is £7,655. The articles in Budget 2000 were produced by the press office in the Department of Finance, there were no outside consultants involved in sourcing or producing copy or content for the newspaper. The printing of the newspaper was put out to tender by my Department on 3 March 2000, and the contract was awarded to New Century Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget 2000 newspaper was distributed by the press office in line with the manner in which all other information leaflets pertaining to the <Col N="641" /> budget are distributed annually. The Department of Finance produces an information leaflet setting out the changes made in that year's budget. The leaflet is then sent to the principals of the 800 second level schools in Ireland for distribution to their students, the distribution list for this is supplied by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The cost of publishing the Budget 2000 newspaper compares very favourably with similar publications over the past few years. As you will note from the following table, the costs this year were considerably less than previous years, providing double the quantity for half the price.</P>
    <P>Due to the additional numbers, the press office was able to disseminate the information to a <Col N="642" /> wider circle. In addition to the second level schools, copies were also sent to all Departments, departmental press offices, Fianna Fáil press office and headquarters and the Progressive Democrat press office and headquarters. Copies were also sent to all national and local media organisations. There are copies available on request from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I and my Department are very happy with the very positive response to the Budget 2000 newspaper and I consider the publication to be the most effective budget information document to have been produced over the past number of years, both in terms of the presentation of the volume of financial data and also in terms of production costs efficiency.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, that the disabled person meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. In cases where the issue of the certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. It should be noted that neither the Revenue Commissioners nor my Department have any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of appeal has advised the Revenue Commissioners that the person named was examined by the board on 27 June 1998. It was found that the person did not meet the medical criteria at that time and the issue of the certificate was refused. It is open to the person concerned to reapply for the certificate if there has been a material change in his/her medical condition to the extent that the medical criteria may now be met. It is regretted that the Revenue Commissioners cannot consider an application for <Col N="644" /> relief without the issue of the primary medical certificate.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental group under the chair of an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria, and I hope to receive its report later in the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the most recent Adjournment debate in this House on the subject of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, which took place on 22 March 2000.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. Essentially, those without the use of limbs, as distinct from those who are just weak in the limbs, will qualify. These regulations were drawn up following wide-ranging consultation with the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, Opposition spokespersons for Finance and organisations dealing with the disabled.</P>
      <P>The scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to representatives from that Department, the group has representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some disability face in coping with every day life. There are very many people with various forms of disability who would consider themselves as having a genuine case for the tax relief. Given the level of the benefits available under the scheme, the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 5,400. On average, the scheme is worth up to £800 per year from the refund of petrol excise, £7,500 relief on the price of a new car <Col N="645" /> every two years, and also gives exemption from road tax. The cost of relief in 1999 was £17 million, as compared to £4 million in 1994, which shows that the scheme is being extensively used by those who qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the tax relief for the employment of a carer. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information available on the tax relief provided under section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for an employed person taking care of an incapacitated taxpayer is that the relief was allowed to some 400 individuals in respect of the income tax year 1997/98, at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of the order of £0.3 million. The allowance for employing a carer applies at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for expenses up to £8,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1999 budget, this tax allowance was only available if a taxpayer employed a carer to care for either the incapacitated taxpayer or his or her incapacitated spouse. However, in the 1999 budget I announced a major widening of the scope of this allowance. The allowance is now available to family members who employ a carer in respect of a totally incapacitated person. This means that a number of family members can now share the cost of employing a carer and share the allowances between them, subject to the overall ceiling of £8,500 in any one year. In addition, carers can now be employed on an individual basis or through an agency. These were significant improvements in the scope of the allowance.</P>
      <P>Any further changes in this relief will be considered in the context of a review I will be undertaking this year of tax reliefs available for taxpayers assisting in the upkeep of a dependent relative, an aged person or an incapacitated person.</P>

      <P>As part of budget 1996, the then Government announced that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo;  Persons on the live register for at least one year who take up paid insurable employment were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance, BTWA, community employment, Jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>The retention of medical card eligibility is approved for a period of three years when a person, or the spouse of a person, who has been unemployed for a minimum of one year takes up employment. In this context, time spent on the live register, approved schemes or courses for the long-term unemployed is treated as an unemployed period.</P>
      <P>I understand that a person taking up a position as a FÁS supervisor is regarded as employed rather than a participant on a scheme. Such a person would be entitled to retain the medical card for three years, provided that he or she was unemployed for a period of 12 months or participated on an approved course or scheme immediately before taking up employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter for the health boards <Col N="647" /> in the first instance. The vast majority of general practitioners have a contract with their local health board to provide immunisations, including MMR, under the programme and there is no reason parents should have a difficulty in arranging to have their children immunised by a general practitioner.</P>
      <P>The primary immunisation programme permits health boards to make special arrangements where the uptake of immunisation among particular groups or in geographical areas is unacceptably low. In the context of the current outbreak of measles in Dublin, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has indicated that a range of control measures have been implemented. A programme of MMR booster immunisations for the primary school population in the region is being initiated, concentrating first on schools where cases of measles have occurred. Other measures include the alerting of general practitioners to the situation and stressing to them the importance of children being offered measles immunisation; the promulgation of information through the media about the risks associated with measles infection and the advisability of immunisation; communication with parents whose children are not recorded as having received MMR vaccination and alerting pre-school facilities to the occurrence of the outbreak.</P>
      <P>While the current outbreak has so far been concentrated in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, since MMR uptake in all health board regions is below 95%, there is a risk that outbreaks will occur elsewhere also. I would therefore like to take this opportunity strongly to urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which has been demonstrated to be very safe and effective. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella.</P>

      <P>The multi-faceted nature of the issue of waiting lists was considered by the expert review group which reported to my predecessor in 1998. I am currently reviewing progress to date in the implementation of the wide-ranging measures of a short, medium and longer term nature recom<Col N="650" /> mended in that report. In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. In this context, a review of bed capacity is currently under way having regard to the trend in demands for health services in recent years. Taken together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of poor accessibility to certain services.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to increasing the number of mothers who breastfeed by the continued implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeeding policy. Although the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit of my Department will continue with initiatives to increase the rates of breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>The promotion of breastfeeding is supported by the health promotion unit in a number of ways in line with the national breastfeeding policy. In prioritising the recommendations of that policy, it was recognised that as health professionals are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after birth, their support would be critical. The advice of qualified healthcare professionals allows the mother to make an informed choice on breastfeeding. The National University of Ireland Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. The pack was developed in conjunction with An Bord Altranais and has been widely disseminated. It is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills to help mothers with breastfeeding their children.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy was that Ireland participate in the baby friendly hospital initiative. This global campaign led by the WHO and UNICEF encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed. This initiative has recently been established in Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved in the initiative continues to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit continues to be involved in ensuring the implementation of other <Col N="651" /> recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. Support is provided to voluntary organisations such as La Leche League, Cuidiú &ndash; Irish Childbirth Trust &ndash; and the Association of Lactation Consultants to produce a range of material to promote the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>Although the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit is committed to increasing the rates of breastfeeding. A new health promotion strategy currently being developed will place continued emphasis on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy. I am confident that the implementation of these recommendations will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that agreement has been reached with the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to a package of exceptional financial assistance for the society in respect of legal fees already incurred by it, and legal and other costs which it will or may incur in the course of the tribunal of inquiry. The details of the package are as follows.</P>
      <P>I agreed to advance funds to enable the society to pay 75% of the brief fees in respect of two senior counsel and two junior counsel, and 75% of refresher fees in respect of retaining two senior counsel and two junior counsel for sitting and non-sitting days of the tribunal. The brief and refresher fees are to be based on the rates and terms applicable to State counsel. I also agreed to advance funds to allow the society to pay a retainer of £10,000 to their solicitors, monthly in arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed to provide an amount of £300,000, inclusive of VAT, to assist the society in retaining medical, scientific and technical experts to advise it during the course of the tribunal. I consider that <Col N="652" /> this amount should be more than sufficient to allow the society to retain the experts it requires during the tribunal. However, if there is any necessity to replenish this fund, the matter will be referred to an independent referee. I also agreed to pay the society an additional £20,000 under this heading in respect of vouched expert expenses already incurred.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has already confirmed that it will reimburse the reasonable costs incurred by witnesses, including expert witnesses, before the tribunal. It has also confirmed that it will reimburse the reasonable costs incurred by any potential witness in preparing a statement of proposed evidence for the tribunal, even where the witness is not in fact called to give evidence, provided the preparation of the statement has been sanctioned by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have agreed that, where a potential expert witness has been engaged by the society and the tribunal has declined to meet the preparatory costs associated with the engagement of such a potential witness, the necessity for and quantum of such fees and expenses incurred by the potential witness will be referred to the independent referee.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to reimburse the society in respect of vouched expenditure of £188,000 sterling for scanning and indexing documents for the tribunal. I have also reached agreement with the society on costs relating to legal work undertaken on behalf of the society on hepatitis C related issues between 1995 and 1997, and on costs relating to preparatory work undertaken by the society's legal advisers prior to the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I have at all times been open, accessible and sympathetic to the society, and committed to finding a mechanism for resolving the society's financial difficulties without trespassing on the jurisdiction of the tribunal by interfering with its powers regarding the awarding of costs. It is important that the Irish Haemophilia Society can participate in this tribunal. I am happy that we have arrived at a solution regarding costs, and that the society now feels that it can take part with confidence in the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>Due to problems with definition, the exact prevalence of autism in Ireland is still open to debate. Depending on the diagnostic criteria being applied, up to five per 10,000 children manifest autism to a marked degree. The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one, that is, it is based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation, hence the concept of an autistic spectrum which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability. The prevalence rate for this group may approach 20 per 10,000 children. There is increasing recognition of the condition of autism in this country. Whether this is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertainment or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism has not yet been determined. As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health related support services for children and adults with autism is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. While new additional services specifically for persons with autism have been and will continue to be developed, many persons with autism are in receipt of services within the intellectual disability services and have benefited generally from the development of new residential, respite and day services which have been substantially enhanced in recent years. However, the Government recognised that there was a need to accelerate the pace at which the identified needs of persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability were being met and is committed to meeting those needs within a defined timeframe of three years, starting with a major acceleration of investment &ndash; both capital and revenue &ndash;  this year.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding being allocated in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services with an annual cost of £35 million. The services being provided with this funding include the development and enhancement of health related support services for persons with autism. Additional capital funding amounting to £80 million is being made available over the three year period 2000 to 2002 to accelerate the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to approximately £5 million has been allocated since 1998 to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and outreach services for children with autism. These services are provided by multi-disciplinary support teams and include the provision of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, psychological and social work support services. The multi-disciplinary teams work closely with the parents and families of children with autism to address their needs. The provision of educational services for children with special needs, including those with autism, is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. In recent years there has been a sig<Col N="654" /> nificant expansion of these services and my Department, in conjunction with the health boards, has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science to provide health related support services to school going children with autism. Both Departments and the health boards will continue to work together to address the needs of these children.</P>
    <P>In relation to the diagnosis of autism, the officially recognised classification systems are those of DSM IV and ICD 10, wherein diagnostic criteria are set out. Over the past number of years, as part of the overall planning and development of services for persons with autism, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the needs of this group in their regions, and in particular regarding those who require or will require specialist services. The Department is also examining a number of measures, including the enhancement of existing information on numbers and the health related support services required by them, as part of the overall assessment of need at national level.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for ensuring that procedures in relation to the removal and retention of organs are put in place in hospitals in the eastern region, including the Coombe Women's Hospital, now rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have, therefore, asked the regional chief executive to investigate this matter and reply directly to the Deputy. In relation to whether a public inquiry is warranted, the Deputy will be aware that on 9 February 2000, I announced my intention to hold an inquiry into post-mortem examination, policy, practice and procedure in the State; and that on 4 April 2000, I outlined the details of the inquiry to be held. The inquiry will be non-statutory and will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be chaired by an eminent senior counsel who will present me with a report of the inquiry's findings within six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of this report I will table a motion that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee, on considering the report, will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public hearing and calling witnesses as appropriate. I considered a full range of options with regard to the format of the inquiry and decided that the non-statutory inquiry, as already outlined, was the most appropriate. I am very aware that consider<Col N="655" /> able trauma and sorrow have been revisited on parents and next of kin by the disclosures in recent months relating to post-mortem examinations. I fully recognise that all affected are anxious that a professional inquiry be conducted which will allow for the full facts to emerge. I am confident that the inquiry as outlined above will provide a new context in which all relevant issues can be dealt with, and that the inquiry will assist everybody concerned in moving forward in a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect between patients and service providers to the benefit of all those who rely on the health services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 171, 173 and 175 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for provision of services at Áras Deirbhla, Belmullet, County Mayo, is a matter for the Western Health Board. I am informed by the board that urgent repairs have had to be carried out in the past few weeks to the hot water piping system at Áras Deirbhla. The repairs resulted in unavoidable disruption to both staff and patients. This disruption was compounded by <Col N="657" /> a delay in getting replacement piping and contractors to carry out the work at short notice. A member of staff endured a fall but is thankfully recovering with support from the nearby district hospital. The board has assured me that the appropriate procedures which apply to injuries at work were adhered to correctly. No other injuries have been reported as a result of the work carried out.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Western Health Board is currently conducting a safety audit in Áras Deirbhle and if the audit indicates a need to involve the Health and Safety Authority, the authority will be invited to conduct a further evaluation.</P>
    <P>The bed complement and the allocation of <Col N="658" /> funding for both Áras Deirbhle and the District Hospital, Belmullet, for the past five years is shown on the following schedule. The revenue allocation for the year 2000 includes a sum of £150,000 for four additional nursing staff and two additional para-medical staff.  This provides for the redesignation of ten existing welfare beds to continuing care which will all but eliminate the need for patients from the local area to avail of long stay care outside the Belmullet area. The refurbishment of Áras Deirbhle and the District Hospital, Belmullet, will depend on the priority attached to such works by the Western Health Board <i>vis-à-vis</i> its other capital proposals for the improvements of services for older people under the national development plan.</P>

      <P>I understand that the National Cancer Forum has recently considered a report on counselling and support services for cancer patients. This report, &ldquo;Cancer Support Services in Ireland, Priorities for Action&rdquo;, is due to be submitted to me shortly.

      <Quest>the reason the Mid Western Health Board, contrary to the provisions of S.I.

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, is administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention.  However, a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing <Col N="663" /> homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources. I understand that the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North Eastern, South Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards pay more than the maximum rate of subvention in certain instances.</P>
      <P>The amount made available for the subvention scheme this year is £38.4 million. My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities in the development of services for older people.</P>

      <P>Waiting lists for orthodontic treatment from the Midland Health Board are maintained by the health board. The most recent information available to me shows that on 21 March 2000 there were 474 children on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment and the average waiting time for treatment is 1.4 to 2.6 years.</P>
      <P>I have allocated additional funding of £100,000 to the Midland Health Board this year on an ongoing basis to provide for the further development of orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>The Moran report on the future development of orthodontic services was made to the chief executive officers of the health boards. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the chief executive officers on the report and its implications. Some interested parties have also commented on the report.</P>
      <P>Many of the proposals in the report are being implemented as part of the dental health action plan while the implications of others are still being teased out with the health boards and other interests.</P>

I have had inquiries made of the board and it informs me that two of its clinicians have gone on maternity leave since January of this year which has reduced the board's operational capacity in the Dublin city/Fingal area.</P>
      <P>However, the board has just finalised a contract with an outside contractor to provide clinics on its behalf. These clinics will commence in May. It is in discussions with a second private contractor to also provide clinics on its behalf.

      <P>The particular funding allocated to the Southern Health Board is for the purpose of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is administered by a task force under the aegis of <Col N="666" /> my Department and operated by the health boards. This scheme provides assistance to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or insanitary conditions in private dwellings.</P>
      <P>Typically, the work undertaken would be necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant, such as repairs to chimney or fireplace, the provision of water and sanitary facilities, the repair of windows or doors, roof repairs, the provision of food storage facilities, etc. and may extend to the provision of appropriate heating systems where found necessary to meet the needs of the elderly persons.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings is the responsibility of the local authority concerned, to be defrayed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is provided by my Department under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated estates, the installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken.</P>

      <P>Regulations made under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, (No. 6 of 1987) banned the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in Dublin since 1990 and in Cork since 1995. In April 1998, I made regulations extending the ban to Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford. Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>Recorded smoke levels improved dramatically when the ban was introduced in Dublin and Cork. The recently published &ldquo;Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 1998&rdquo; from the Environmental Protection Agency, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, also shows the positive effects of the extension of the ban to the new areas in terms of air quality.</P>
      <P>A possible extension of the ban to additional areas is currently under consideration and I expect to make an announcement in this regard shortly. While new regulations would be necessary to extend the ban, I have no plans to amend the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</P>

      <P>While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a legal remedy has been provided under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Noise) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 179 of 1994). This allows an individual, a group of residents, a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency to make a complaint to the District Court in respect of noise which gives reasonable cause for annoyance, for the purpose of obtaining an order for the reduction, prevention or limitation of the noise. The defendant is obliged to comply with any such order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>A primary focus of action to date in relation to the management of packaging and packaging waste has been the establishment and operation of Repak Ltd.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made by Repak Ltd. since it became operational, and a new basis now used for the determination of Repak membership fees, which has regard to the volume and recoverable nature of packaging placed by members on the Irish market, should support the minimisation of packaging, and, therefore, packaging waste arising. However, it is intended to appoint consultants to carry out an early review of the Repak operations and make recommendations, <i>inter alia,</i> regarding further measures that should be undertaken by Repak Ltd. to support the recovery of packaging waste from the municipal waste stream, increase the recovery rate for packaging waste generally, to ensure compliance with EU targets for 2001 and 2005, and support the development of indigenous reprocessing capacity for packaging waste.</P>
      <P>In a wider context, it is intended to expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in the waste management policy statement, &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo;, with the publication this year of a further policy statement focusing on waste minimisation, recycling and recovery generally. This will outline the scope of measures to be undertaken in the interests of a sustained improvement in our waste recovery and recycling performance.</P>
      <P>Deposit and refund schemes in respect of refillable and reusable beverage containers, operating in a small number of EU member states, are currently being examined. With regard to packaging waste generally, the question of which packaging materials, products or packaging systems are environmentally preferable is complex, and a definitive assessment of the best practicable environmental option in any specific circumstance requires appropriate life cycle analysis.</P>
      <P>I will be supportive of any appropriate policy initiatives at EU level which may be brought forward in the context of the current review of Directive 94/62/EC, with a view to improving current performance in relation to the minimisation and reuse of packaging and packaging waste.</P>
      <P>A range of measures are in place to reduce litter pollution, and the national anti-litter forum which is due to report monthly is developing further initiatives with the objective of solving the litter problem. The forum recommendations will be given detailed consideration in my Department.</P>

    <P>My Department's costs related to the supervision of the national car testing service, and the carrying out of annual and mid-term reviews of the service, will be offset by a levy paid to the Department by NCTS. It is estimated that this levy will amount to around £530,000 in 2000.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the service is carried out by the <Col N="673" /> Department with the assistance of a supervision services contractor. PricewaterhouseCoopers, Belfast, was awarded the initial supervisory contract for a term which extends to 30 June 2000, at the cost of £155,000 identified above. It is planned to invite tenders by mid-year for the provision of the required supervisory service for the remainder of the term of the car testing contract.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 71 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, specifically prohibits the abandonment of <Col N="674" /> vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with abandoned cars.</P>
    <P>Section 32(1) of the 1996 Act prohibits the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies,<i> inter alia,</i> to the owner of an end-of-life vehicle, ELV. ELVs may be transferred to one of a number of facilities that have been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of such vehicles. Local authorities are required under section 38(3) of the 1996 Act to provide or arrange for the provision of such facilities as appear to be necessary and reasonable, at which vehicles may be discarded.</P>
    <P>I have no data in relation to the number of vehicles abandoned in 1999 and 2000 and no function in the collection of such data. In 1998, my Department invited the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, to develop a voluntary producer responsibility initiative in relation to ELVs which would take account of a draft European Parliament and Council directive currently being developed. A SIMI proposal on an ELV management system for Ireland was submitted in December 1999. Having regard to the draft EU directive, this proposal includes measures aimed at preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery of ELVs and their components, ensuring that economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs, and ensuring that vehicles are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution. The proposal has been examined in my Department and will shortly be the subject of detailed discussions with SIMI. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme not later than autumn 2000.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of retirement pension at the maximum personal rate. She applied for carer's allowance in April 1999. Under social welfare regulations, carer's allowance and retirement pension are not payable concurrently. Accordingly, the person concerned continues to receive payment of retirement pension. However, her entitlement to secondary benefits will be examined further.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable at any one time to an individual. The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, examined the issue of paying carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment but concluded that the present practice should continue. The review noted that the allowance as it stands is an income support payment and not a payment for caring.</P>
      <P>However, the review raised the issue of a &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment to recognise all carers who were providing the highest levels of care. One of the key priorities identified in the Government's review of its Action Programme for the Millennium is to establish a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care to be operated by the health boards. This matter is under consideration by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a continual care payment will be considered further in the light of the outcome of this examination.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April, regardless of the temperature. As a consequence, there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably low and equally, the allowance is paid at times when temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20% in the past six <Col N="677" /> years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. A sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the estimates for the scheme for the 1999-2000 fuel season.</P>
    <P>Any extension to the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account.</P>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999 with further increases of either £4 or £7 which will come into effect from May 2000.</P>
    <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of the year. This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme. Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>The farm assist scheme, which came into operation just over a year ago introduced special arrangements for farmers on low incomes.</P>
      <P>On 31 March 2000, there were 7,568 farm assist claims in payment, receiving on average £75.85 per week. The average payment to 431 claimants still in receipt of small-holder's unemployment assistance on that date was £75.43.</P>
      <P>Former small-holders, who are now in receipt of farm assist, are receiving on average £83.82 per week, an increase of £9 per week compared with small-holder's unemployment assistance at the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>New applicants to farm assist are receiving an average payment of £59 per week.</P>
      <P>On the application form completed by former small-holders, many of them indicated that their circumstances had changed since their last assessment. Following reviews of their means, 3,565 claimants are now in receipt of an increased payment while 1,276 have had their payments reduced.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, makes a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. The child related disregards are being increased from £100 for the first two children and £200 for each subsequent qualified child to £200 and £300 respectively.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, will now be taken into account. There are also changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded, and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore. These changes will be effective from October 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a range of grants schemes and programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local <Col N="679" /> self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs. To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. Grants are not available from my Department towards services that are deemed the responsibility of other Departments or statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations operated by my Department provides once-off grants to voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas, towards renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications, research or other special projects. The types of groups eligible for funding under this scheme are community development and area development organisations, family support groups, welfare rights and information groups, mutual support and self-help organisations and co-ordinating and umbrella organisations.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme of grants to locally-based community and family support groups funding may be made available to locally-based groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the Dublin north regional office of my Department received applications under both schemes from the group concerned. As a large number of applications have been received and will take time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to the group under this year's schemes. However, my Department will be in touch with the group in due course regarding its applications.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of one-parent family payment until August 1999. Her claim was terminated when she failed to supply a statement of her earnings for the purpose of receiving her entitlement. She qualified for disability benefit with effect from 3 September 1999.</P>

    <P>She re-applied for a one-parent family payment on 13 September 1999. The Department requested her on a number of occasions to for<Col N="680" /> ward a statement from her employer confirming her earnings and also to supply evidence of her efforts to obtain maintenance from her spouse. As she failed to forward the necessary documentation, her application was refused. A maintenance hearing on the case is due to be held this week.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has been requested again by the Department to supply a statement from her employer confirming her gross weekly earnings and a copy of the court order in relation to maintenance.

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of free electricity and telephone rental allowances is that the applicant must reside alone or only with certain excepted categories of persons.

      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned was due for review at the end of the 1998-99 academic year when the certificate of full-time education expired for one of her children and she was requested to supply the necessary details. As no reply was received her entitlement to a free telephone rental allowance was stopped from November 1999 and her free electricity allowance from the end of December 1999. She was informed accordingly.</P>

      <P>The error which occurred in this case arose when the pension number of the person concerned was wrongly entered in the computer system instead of the pension number of another pensioner who had died and whose claim was being stopped. This action set procedures in train which resulted in the termination of the free scheme entitlements of the person concerned and the non-renewal of his pension when his current book expired.</P>
      <P>However, the error was identified in time to prevent the withdrawal of the person's current book. The steps necessary to reverse the termination of the free schemes were not, however, taken.</P>
      <P>The cessation of the person's free schemes was brought to light by a complaint from the pensioner's family. The customer complaints manager subsequently wrote to the person concerned and apologised for the error. The free schemes were reinstated in time to prevent any interruption of benefit. The issue of his renewal pension book was delayed but this has now been corrected.</P>

      <P>A review of the free schemes was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin last week. This is the first major review of these schemes since they were introduced in the 1960s.</P>
      <P>The review examined the issue of extending the free schemes to retired public servants and recommended that this group should qualify for the free schemes in view of the wider social objectives of care in the community. The review considered that the extension of the schemes to those over age 75 would be of significant benefit to this group.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that I have already implemented, in budget 2000, the proposal put forward in the review to extend the free schemes to all people aged over 75 regardless of income and household composition. In addition, I have also extended all free schemes to carers in receipt of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>I also intend to move towards the establishment of a single household benefits scheme in future budgets. This will amalgamate the existing separate free schemes administered by my Department into a single household benefits scheme with a streamlined application process.</P>
      <P>The report examines a large number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations, including the further extension of the free schemes to those not in receipt of social welfare payments, in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>
      <P>The living alone allowance is payable to people of pensionable age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and is intended to recognise the extra cost of living alone.</P>
      <P>It is open to any person of pensionable age, who does not qualify for a contributory pension and whose means are inadequate, to apply to the Department for an old age non-contributory pension. If they satisfy the means test, they can qualify for a full or partial old age pension and, if living alone may also qualify for a living alone allowance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with advice received by me from the Heritage Council, I sought clarification from the Attorney General as to the legal status of the deer hunted by the Ward Union Hunt. Having considered the advice that I received from the Heritage Council and from the Attorney General, it did not appear to me that there was a case for refusing to licence the hunt in the context of my remit, which is primarily related to wildlife conservation and following <Col N="684" /> consultations between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, I decided that the relevant provision of section 26 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, should remain unchanged. The legal advice available to me indicated that that provision is clearly the intended mechanism for regulating the activities of the Ward Union Hunt and I consider that those activities should continue to be so regulated. While there is no conservation concern at issue in this context, my Department, assisted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has had discussions with the hunt, in the context of the renewal of its licence, regarding means by which public concerns expressed in relation to the deer in question may be addressed to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>The monastery chapel of St. Alphonsus is a building of international architectural significance and was rated as a list 1 building in the 1999 Dublin city development plan. As such, it automatically became a protected structure on January 1 of this year, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>I met last week with representatives of the local community who were concerned about the future of the chapel. This delegation proposed the establishment of a trust involving my Department, Shannon Homes &ndash; the developers &ndash;  An Taisce, the Redemptoristine Order and local community groups. They were strongly of the opinion that the chapel should not remain in private ownership, pointing to major alterations carried out on other church interiors in the Dublin area. While I acknowledged their fears, I pointed out that the coming into effect of the 1999 Act on January 1 last strengthens the protection of the architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded under the new Act, covers both the interior and exterior of the building and, in the absence of a declaration from Dublin Corporation outlining works which are exempted development, any alterations to the chapel will require planning permission. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observation. I believe that the strength of these provisions will be sufficient to safeguard the architectural integrity of the building.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department recently met with representatives of Shannon Homes and were informed that the building was to be offered for sale on the Irish market. The stated aim of the developers is to find a buyer who will have a use for the building that will not adversely affect its architectural integrity.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that a suitable buyer may not be found, a number of potential options for the future management of the chapel were also discussed. These included: the formation of a trust between my Department, Shannon Homes, the Redemptoristine Order and a representative of local community groups; ownership retained by Shannon Homes but a management committee, which will include a representative from my Department, will be set up to safeguard the future of the chapel; ownership transferred to my Department, with the setting up of a similar management committee, involving Shannon Homes, who will provide funding for the upkeep of the chapel; continued reliance on the powers of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, to protect the chapel's architectural integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These options are presently being considered by Shannon Homes, although it has been decided <Col N="686" /> to await any developments resulting from the sale offer before any further actions take place. In the meantime, the chapel continues to be protected by the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>

      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, which implements the parental leave Directive, 96/34/EC, came into operation on 3 December 1998. The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion, dated 3 April 2000, to the effect that Ireland, by restricting the right to parental leave to employees with children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996, has not correctly transposed the EU directive on parental leave. The Commission has requested that Ireland take <Col N="689" /> the measures necessary to comply with the reasoned opinion within two months following notification. My Department is currently in consultation with the Attorney General's office with a view to identifying, as a matter of urgency, the measures required to be put in place to give effect to the reasoned opinion including the issue of entitlement to parental leave in respect of children born or adopted between 4 December, 1993 and 2 June, 1996. Initial indications are that it may be possible to amend the Parental Leave Act by way of statutory instrument rather than by primary legislation.</P>

      <P>The directorate for Asylum Support Services, which was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department is responsible,<i> inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>As outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 378 of 11 April 2000, the directorate, in accordance with Government policy, is currently assessing the potential of accommodation offers in all regions throughout the State. In line with normal practice, I do not propose to release details of properties being actively pursued until such time as the arrangements in relation to them have been agreed and relevant formalities concluded with the proprietors.</P>
      <P>Because of the shortage of accommodation in Dublin the Eastern Health Board has had to urgently accommodate asylum seekers coming to the country in properties sourced by the directorate. However, with effect from 10 April 2000, the directorate has taken over the allocation of all accommodation. New structures and arrangements have been put in place which will facilitate both the preparation of asylum seekers and the provision of information to local communities. Under the new arrangements, asylum seekers will be accommodated at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one to two weeks for the purposes, <i>inter alia, </i>of needs assessment and processing of the initial stages of their asylum applications before being resettled at other locations around the country. The directorate recently took possession of three initial reception centres in Dublin. Meetings with local community representatives were arranged in each case prior to opening. From week commencing 17 April 2000 staff from the directorate will be attending similar meetings at locations all around the country where asylum seekers are to be resettled.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently implementing a major IT programme both for the <Col N="693" /> core Department and in respect of the agencies under the aegis of the Department. These developments include the implementation of a secure, web-enabled infrastructure which, in addition to supporting operational, financial and administrative systems, will also be used to allow for electronic transfer of information within the justice area, links to the other Government Departments and future access to systems for the general public as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The systems are, in the main, developed by private sector computer companies under the control of the Department by way of programme and project boards with membership from both the IT and business areas of the Department-agencies. Most of the development on these systems began before the e-Government initiative but the software platforms are flexible enough to allow for the implementation of e-Government concepts as they evolve.</P>
      <P>A related project is also ongoing to develop and maintain a common data model and to ensure electronic transfer of information, identify and promote integration and interworking possibilities between the various elements of the criminal justice system. In addition, provision of services to the general public has been part of the IT strategy of my Department for the past three years. Therefore, where it is considered that systems may in future require an electronic interface with the public, the systems procured or developed must be technically capable of being extended in this way without major rewriting. This has been part of the evaluation criteria for systems selection since 1998.</P>
      <P>In order to progress the integration of systems within the justice arena and to identify how such systems may interface with the general public in due course, an application to fund a scoping study in the Garda, courts, prisons and departmental areas was made to the electronic Government initiatives fund under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach. Approval, in principle, has been obtained and work has just commenced.</P>
      <P>In addition, on the Courts Service side, a number of specific projects have been identified and a scoping study to determine the extent of these projects is also under way. Examples of such projects include lodgment of documents by solicitors electronically and small claims courts applications by members of the public. In respect of the Land Registry the first phase of an on-line electronic search service of property folios has been implemented.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000, presented to the Seanad on 31 March 2000 represents the Government's policy for a comprehensive overhaul of the law in relation to hours of trading, licensing and under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>In so far as the subject matter of the question is concerned, I draw the Deputy's attention in particular to part 4 of the Bill. Its effect is to abolish certain restrictions in the law on persons who wish to open a new licensed premises based on population increase, the one mile rule, and extinguishment of one or two existing licences depending on whether it is a rural or city licence. The Bill provides simply that a new licence may be issued anywhere in the State in substitution for one existing licence where the court is satisfied as to the fitness of the applicant, the fitness or convenience of the new premises, and by reference to the adequacy of the existing number of licensed premises in the vicinity of the proposed new premises. The new rules which I have provided for in the Bill, will substantially change the manner in which a licence may be acquired for a new premises.</P>

      <P>The Government decided last September that asylum seekers should be <Col N="695" /> resettled around the country and have their needs met by direct provision. The directorate for asylum support services was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department and, is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. The directorate has been accommodating asylum seekers under these new arrangements since 10 April and up to 14 April has placed 226 asylum seekers in four centres.</P>
      <P>Prior to 10 April 2000, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers was handled, in the main, by the Eastern Health Board in whose administrative area the majority of asylum seekers are located. Since last November, however, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has had to accommodate some asylum seekers coming to the country in accommodation sourced by the directorate.</P>
      <P>In the time available it has not been possible to collate all of the information requested. However, arrangements are being made to have the information procured from the health boards and supplied to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation </P>
    <P>(Dr. McDaid): I propose to take Questions Nos. 259, 266, 267 and 268 together.</P>
    <P>This Government has signalled its commitment to the development of sport and recreational facilities by increasing the funding for capital expenditure for this purpose, by over 350%, from £8.5 million in 1997 to £41.07 million in the Estimates for the year 2000. This increase includes provision for more than a trebling in funding for the sport capital programme from £5 million in 1997 to £15.2 million in 2000; a fourfold increase in the provision for the swimming pool programme from £3.5 million in 1997 to £15.18 million in 2000; assistance towards the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool and the final instalment of the £20 million grant towards the development of Croke Park.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme which is operated by my Department provides funding towards the provision of sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities my Department, in addition to the normal assessment criteria, consults with the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. My Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Departments and with the local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, special priority is given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. In addition, applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and the local authority before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and-or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national level are also required to ensure that the proposals are consistent with the priorities of their national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Under the 1999 sport capital programme, grants totalling some £19.99 million were allocated to 416 local community based projects and to a number of national and regional projects throughout the country. Provision is being made in the multi-annual estimates for the continuation of the programme at similar levels to 1999 in 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was advertised in early December 1999 with a closing date of 11 February 2000 for the receipt of completed applications. Over 1,600 applications were received and the initial processing of these has been completed. All of the applications received under the programme will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are <Col N="698" /> outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form and I hope to be in a position to announce the grant allocations by June 2000.</P>
    <P>I have secured an increase in funding of £36 million over the next three years for the local authority swimming pool programme &ndash; from £3 million in 1999 to £15 million per annum for the next three years. In addition, the provision of Ireland's first 50 metre pool is under way in Limerick and the Government is proceeding with the development of Sports Campus Ireland. Together, all these initiatives will provide the country with a range of world class indoor and outdoor facilities for a wide range of sports.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan financial assistance amounting to £85 million will be available over the seven years of the plan to support the development of sport and recreational facilities by local authorities, particularly in areas which lack them and for voluntary groups developing multi-sport and recreational facilities where no such facilities currently exist.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council provides funding to the national coaching and training centre for the development and enhancement of coaching in Ireland as well as for the provision of physiological, scientific, medical and other related services to elite individual competitors and squads.</P>
    <P>Grants to national governing bodies of sport aimed at the development of their sports and the raising of coaching and competitive standards were increased by 30% this Olympic year, and over £1 million has been allocated to our top competitors under the international carding scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government set up the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, YPFSF, in 1998 as part of its national drugs strategy, to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The three year fund aims to attract young people in those areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits. An Exchequer contribution of £34.8 million has been allocated over a three year period, 1999-2001, for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas, of which 12 are located in Dublin. In April 1999, the Government allocated over £25 million to support 295 facility and services projects in these areas over the next three years. Of this amount £22 million was allocated to 268 individual projects in Dublin, including £994,000 to support eight facility projects in the north inner city task force area.</P>
    <P>Finally, Fingal County Council has completed a feasibility study on the provision of an indoor athletics training facility adjacent to the existing athletics facilities at Morton Stadium, which is prioritised in the review of the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium. An application for funding for the project has been sub<Col N="699" /> mitted by Fingal County Council and this is being considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is now under way an ambitious programme of State assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently met with the principal of this school to discuss this and a range of other issues. The position regarding the school is that it is currently involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement with another primary school under the 1978 scheme for the employment of secretaries in primary schools. In addition to the shared secretary arrangement, the school had up to this year been receiving an additional per capita grant of £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services, under the PESP scheme that was introduced in 1992.</P>
      <P>In view of the increased allocation that has been made available this year, and effective from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils became eligible for a grant towards caretaking services under this scheme. In addition I increased the rate of grant by 33% to £20 per pupil. This has resulted in the grant for caretaking services to this school increasing from £5,190 in 1999 to £6,880 this year. My Department has already issued the increased grant to the school.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, with effect from January 2001, all primary schools will become eligible for grant assistance under this scheme. My Department has recently issued a circular to all schools on this matter.</P>
      <P>The allocation for grant assistance to schools in respect of caretaking and secretarial services increased from approximately £5.6 million in 1999 to £11.2 million this year. I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that in framing proposals for the spending of the increased allocation, it was necessary for me to examine means of ensuring that all schools would receive assistance from my Department in respect of such services. The scheme that I have put in place will mean that from January of 2001 all primary schools will, for the first time, be receiving grant assistance in respect of these services from my Department. In addition the increase of 33% in the rate of grant also means that schools that were already receiving assistance have had their grant levels significantly increased.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third level course. I would point out to the Deputy that this condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment <Col N="705" /> of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand that similar residency requirements operate in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The removal of this residency condition for Irish nationals would have to apply to EU nationals generally and could have significant resource implications for the Exchequer. The matter has been raised by a number of Deputies and I have asked my officials to re-examine the issue and report to me in due course.</P>
      <P>Candidates who are EU nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirements under the free fees initiative are eligible to apply for a means tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an EU member state from 1 October of the year prior to entry to college.</P>

      <P>With regard to funding of voluntary secondary schools, notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the level of support for voluntary secondary schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. The standard per capita grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of voluntary secondary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>At the same time, both schools have applied for major capital investment and, because there are health and safety considerations, immediate action to provide replacement accommodation is called for.

      <P>The development of the primary pupil database which I referred to in reply to Question No. 594 of 21 March 2000 is a very significant undertaking which will involve the collection and processing of information on 450,000 pupils in more than 3,300 primary schools. While the IT Unit of my Department intends to implement the first phase of the development plan in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year, it is envisaged that it will take at least three years <Col N="714" /> to put the full database in place. It is unlikely that this timescale can be expedited as the development work that needs to take place is of a complex nature.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may also be aware that the Education (Welfare) Bill currently being considered in this House will provide a new framework to address issues generally related to school attendance. The Bill provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board, with a general responsibility to ensure that &ldquo;each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education&rdquo;. The legislation makes specific provision to track the attendance of all children at first and second level, and particularly in the transition between first and second level. The legislation will also include specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system. It is my hope that this legislation will be enacted before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>The student to whom the Deputy refers was assessed by a psychologist from the national educational psychological service on 8 September 1999. The psychologist met with the student's mother on 30 September 1999. He furnished a full report to the school and to the parents on 14 October 1999 and met with both parents on 1 November 1999.</P>
      <P>Between November 1999 and to-date the psychologist has been involved in both the placement of the student and in liasing with the relevant section of my Department in relation to the student's needs. I understand that the necessary resources have been made available to her present school to enable it to be in a position to cater for her particular needs.</P>

A number of these concepts can accommodate the study of issues relating to road safety, for example, rights and responsibilities and law.

      <Quest>the reason the junior certificate metalwork projects are not returned to students after correction; and the proposals, if any, to change this situation.</Quest>

      <P>Every year, my Department examines over 1.5 million scripts, practical pieces and other test products. It has not proved logistically feasible to facilitate the return of this quantity of examination material to candidates on an individual basis. Through the co-operation of school authorities it has proved possible to provide leaving certificate students with an opportunity to view their marked scripts though initially school authorities had reservations about storage and other issues.</P>
      <P>The basic difficulty is our total reliance in Ireland on external assessment at junior certificate that in turn necessitates the movement of some practical pieces from schools to the Department. In other countries students' project and practical work is assessed by their own teachers and consequently the work is readily available in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing review of junior cycle my Department issued a discussion paper advocating changes in the approach to assessment at junior certificate. Ultimately it is in the context of overall reform at junior cycle that improve<Col N="722" /> ments such as that suggested by the Deputy can be advanced.</P>

      <P>Review of all four technology subjects, including engineering, is at present being undertaken by the NCCA. Part of the review process will focus on modes of assessment appropriate to any new programme proposals. The structure and content of the proposed new syllabus places a strong emphasis on problem solving, research, analysis and the design and manufacture of practical solutions. I have not as yet received any proposals from the NCCA in relation to how the revised syllabus in engineering may be assessed.</P>

      <P>The issues of food and nutrition, and the importance of a healthy diet, form part of both the social, personal and health education curriculum and of the science curriculum that were issued to all primary schools last September. The implementation of the curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in career professional development for teachers. I am satisfied that this process will play a major role in educating our children in all aspects of food and nutrition and in learning to appreciate the importance of good nutrition for growing and <Col N="723" /> developing and staying healthy as they progress into second and third level education.</P>
      <P>In addition, while I have no plans at this stage to subsidise the provision of fresh fruit to students, my Department is represented on a Department of Social Community and Family Affairs working group that is reviewing the operation of the school meals scheme. The Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Dublin Corporation are also represented on the working group. It is anticipated that it will take seven-eight months for the working group to complete its review.</P>
