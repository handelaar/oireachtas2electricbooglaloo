      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of files that have been sent by his Department to the Flood and Moriarty tribunals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my reply to the House on 23 March 1999 the solicitor to the Moriarty tribunal has written to my Department by way of confidential letters on three separate matters. Each of these letters has been replied to by my Department. No departmental files have been sought in this period nor are there any outstanding requests from the tribunal.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Flood tribunal no requests have been made for files or additional information since 23 March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, to ensure the utmost confidentiality in all dealings with the tribunals and to ensure they are enabled to perform the tasks assigned to them by the Oireachtas, it <Col N="2" /> would not be appropriate for me to go into detail on any dealings with either of the tribunals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach conducted or had conducted an audit of the files in his Department generally to establish if there are any that ought to be volunteered to the tribunals or is he simply acting on the basis of requests from the tribunals only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time the tribunals began their work, my Department was asked for files. I gave information here previously on the files that were sent to them. The Department would have sent quite a number of files to the tribunals at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that as the tribunals proceed new topics are coming to light as being of interest to them and that in light of that the Government should conduct a further examination of its files to ascertain if there is any other further matter that ought to be drawn to their attention, given what we now know about their scope of thrust that was not necessarily <Col N="3" /> known to the Government at the time of their initial establishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When a new issue comes before the tribunals and they consider there may be a file on it in a Department, they contact that Department. New issues arose some time ago in respect of which my Department passed files to one of the tribunals. I believe some Ministers have done likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How would either of the tribunals know for sure whether a Department had a file that is of interest to it? Given that it would not necessarily know that, surely it behoves the Government to have in place some such system of examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If my Department or I were aware of an issue that would be of interest to the tribunals, we would pass it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that, as Deputy Bruton said, the scope and workload, particularly of the Flood tribunal, is so extensive, has the Taoiseach or the Government considered getting the views of the sole member of that tribunal on the possibility of an interim report rather than having to wait perhaps several years before a report is placed before these Houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an interim report is a matter for the sole member of that tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach considering exploring the views of the sole member on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I will, as I do not want to interfere. The sole member has made it clear that he is following a module approach into various sectors. I am sure he will indicate in his own time to the Ceann Comhairle, which is the appropriate way, when he is finished or wishes to submit a report, but there has been no such indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach welcome an interim report or a progress report from the Flood tribunal in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle. Is the Taoiseach aware that any such file numbered and submitted to the tribunal has to do with urban designations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from media reports and replies made in this House that quite a number of files about urban designations have been forwarded to the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategy statement covering the period 1998-2001 was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 May 1998. The key goals for the Department can be summarised as follows: facilitating the efficient functioning of Government as the executive power of the State; bringing about and maintaining lasting peace on the island of Ireland and the realisation of a new three stranded political settlement; developing a strategic focus for Ireland's interests and image at international level; working with the social partners to develop and implement national programmes of economic and social development; and the ongoing development of an efficient public service. My Department has made significant progress towards achieving the goals in all of these areas. Each division has drawn up a comprehensive business plan setting out the action required to meet the objectives set out in the strategy statement. The divisional business plans are monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In addition, we are finalising our progress report on the strategy statement for the years 1998 and 1999, as required under section 4 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. We expect to have the progress report completed shortly. Once completed, the progress report will be submitted to Government and will, when approved, be laid before both Houses for their information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic management initiative division of my Department is charged with the ongoing <Col N="5" /> development of an efficient public service which delivers excellent services. Considerable progress has been made in the following areas: developing the quality customer service initiative; human resources management, including performance management; reforming the financial management system; staff recruitment and gender equality issues; advancing the regulatory reform programme; and developing the information technology agenda. The latest phase of the strategic management initiative is the new performance management and development system which I formally launched on 11 May. The launch marked an important stage in the modernisation and change programme in the Civil Service and is the culmination of a wide-ranging and inclusive consultative process between management and unions. The PMDS is based on clearly identifying roles and the range of competencies that each person needs to fulfil their role. The spirit of the new PMDS is captured in the theme agreed for the launch: &ldquo;Excellence through Performance &ndash; Moving forward Together&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives identified in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the implementation of this system in each Department and office. In my own Department a project team has been established and a comprehensive implementation plan has been developed. Training for all staff in the PMDS is to commence later in June.</P>
    <P>My Department has continued to make significant progress in implementing financial management reform. A comprehensive implementation strategy was completed in January of this year, covering the period 2000 to 2002. A team is currently being put in place, with appropriate professional expertise, to bring the project to a conclusion in accordance with that strategy. In addition, the Department's financial management structure has been strengthened by the setting up of a dedicated internal audit unit.</P>
    <P>Government policy on the information society is set out in the Government action plan. Essentially they are concerned with developing the Information Society in Ireland in a co-ordinated way and contributing to policy development, with a particular focus on e-government. A major goal is the provision of integrated e-government services focused on the needs of the customer. The key areas in which the policy development team has played a major role include the co-ordination and publication &ndash; November 1999 &ndash; of guidelines for public service web publication.</P>
    <P>More recently, and very significantly, the team and the implementation group have worked with other key players, including CMOD and the REACH team on devising a model for the &ldquo;e-Broker model&rdquo;, by which public services will be delivered in an integrated way. This is a very significant step towards the delivery of public services using modern technologies and will result in substantial benefits for the customer and the service providers alike.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legislative priorities of my <Col N="6" /> Department for 2000, as I indicated to Deputy Bruton in my reply to him on 24 May, the drafting of the Bill to place the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum on a statutory basis is at an advanced stage. These bodies will be located within an Office for National Economic and Social Development.</P>
    <P>The Statute Law Restatement Bill, 2000, which was published on Monday, 29 May is currently before the Seanad and is scheduled for discussion on Thursday. The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Attorney General to publish a certified version of the text of an Act incorporating any amendments made by later Acts into one up-to-date statement of the Act as amended. A restatement will not amend existing legislation. Instead it will transpose it into a more accessible form that will be a<i> prima facie </i>evidence of the law being restated.</P>
    <P>The Interpretation Bill will be a consolidation and modernisation of previous Interpretation Acts, providing additional interpretation rules, principles and definitions. The Bill has been drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman at the insistence of the Attorney General. I expect the Bill will be published before the Dáil goes into recess.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that my Department has made an important contribution to moving the agenda forward in relation to the key areas set out in the Department's strategy statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. Does he accept that one of his obligations as Taoiseach, and one of the obligations of his Department, is to ensure that Cabinet procedural instructions are respected in the efficient performance of Government business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging that, is the Taoiseach aware of the provision in Cabinet procedural instructions, paragraph 221, which says that where an appointment to a board or the like is to be made, each Minister making such an appointment must raise the matter at Cabinet two weeks in advance of making the appointment, to allow colleagues the opportunity of making recommendations? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this provision of Cabinet procedural instructions was clearly breached in the case of the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank in that the matter was not mentioned at Government, two weeks' notice was not given, and colleagues were not given the opportunity of putting forward other names?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that assuring that Cabinet procedural instructions are respected in all cases is a key part of his function as Taoiseach and, therefore, in order to test that, can he account for his failure to ensure that Cabinet procedural instructions were abided by in perhaps the most important, and certainly the most lucrative, appointment the Government has made this year?</P>

The Taoiseach already acknowledged that a key part of his function as Taoiseach is to ensure they are respected.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is no way of judging whether Cabinet procedural instructions are abided by in the case of appointments, without making reference to particular cases, because each case is particular and, therefore, the only way one can test whether this provision has any meaning at all &ndash; and whether the Taoiseach is abiding by Cabinet procedural instructions &ndash; is by questioning a particular case?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its meeting on 28 April, the National Economic and Social Council discussed its draft work programme for the period to autumn 2001. The council hopes to finalise this programme at its meeting on Friday, 16 June. While the particular issues to be addressed will be a matter for the council to decide, the Government agreed with the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the council should be asked to prepare reports on a number of issues. These are reflected in the draft work programme. I understand there will be two broad research categories. The first will address the provision of <Col N="13" />&ldquo;Information for policy&rdquo;. This will encompass the identification and development of national progress indicators, benchmarking specific progress with respect to elements of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and evaluation of the pilot poverty proofing project.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the council is proposing to examine medium-term strategic policy options in key policy areas, including the tax and social welfare systems and the management of public expenditure. I have no plans at this time to commission any further specific report from the council.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the council recently published a research paper titled &ldquo;Profit Sharing, Employee Ownership and Gainsharing: What can they Achieve?&rdquo;. This provides a review of these mechanisms based on the experience OECD countries. It was prepared as a background paper to the NESC strategy report published last December. Copies of the paper have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe adequate progress has been made in extending gainsharing throughout the economy given that it provides a means of rewarding additional productivity in a non-inflationary way? Has he any views on how gainsharing can be applied in the public sector? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The paper finds some evidence that financial participation may contribute to an increase in productivity. I have supported such measures over the years because I believe that if employees have share ownership and are part of the profit sharing and gainsharing of a company, they show more interest and feel more part of the company. However, while the report shows that this may contribute to an increase in productivity, there is no great evidence that this is the case. The report also finds that financial participation is more effective when combined with employee participation in workplace decisions. It states that while the evidence is inconclusive, some studies have found that profit sharing is associated with more stable employment. The research paper states that while the level of these forms of compensation is low, more and more companies are considering financial participation in schemes.</P>
      <P>I said previously in this House that the Government is considering how to proceed with this issue. During discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we agreed to consider profit sharing and gainsharing as part of rating performance and competitiveness during the progress of the current programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the extent of gainsharing in the economy is minuscule and does he intend taking measures to cause a wider take-up? Does he acknowledge the Government and the Minister for Finance flew in the face of the NESC strategy in terms of the budget which is now proven to be wildly inflationary? Having regard to today's figures on <Col N="14" /> inflation, which are a serious cause for alarm, will the Government ask the NESC to look specifically at this question? Will the Government take steps in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that there is not a great element of profit sharing, gainsharing or financial employee incentives in the economy. There is a case for looking at increasing performance and competitiveness. However, the Deputy will be aware that this must be agreed with the social partners because those who cannot readily gain and benefit believe that if there is not a mechanism for them it is not a fair system. It has been argued for a long time by trades unions that if this applies only to the sectors where gainsharing and profit sharing is easily permissible, others may fall apart.</P>
      <P>Of course the Government is concerned about the current inflation figures which are higher than anticipated and reflect increases in a variety of areas. We had a meeting last week at official level with ICTU and IBEC and there will be a meeting at political level in the near future. We are considering a range of measures in different areas, including housing. While we must allow for competition on the one hand, we must look at specific areas where it is clear there is excessive profit taking. This issue will have to be dealt with in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The NESC made specific recommendations on housing which the Government has not tackled. In relation to excessive profit taking, to which the Taoiseach referred, is the entirely disproportionate contribution of drink prices to the consumer index rise a matter for serious concern and action by the Government? The Government is pussyfooting with the publicans and vintners and refusing to take action other than talk vaguely about competition and introducing additional licences at some time in the future. The price increases on drink are a disgrace and of serious concern in terms of maintaining a competitive tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this matter on several occasions. The current increase is 1.2% due to trade increases in the price of beer and spirits. I hope the measures in relation to licences outside the city areas being purchased, in addition to the relaxation of the regulations attaching to clubs, will mean more competition in populated areas and cities. The Government will also examine other measures to see what can be done. In this and other areas, the Competition Authority has given its views on anti-competitive behaviour and we must examine all these issues. Unfortunately, the result of profiteering is extraordinarily excessive prices. I do not know the real figures nor can I provide proof, but those in the profession say profit is in excess of 50% on the bottom line, which is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I made the point at the ICTU conference that I wished people went to places where <Col N="15" /> the prices were most competitive when there is competition in a locality. However, that unfortunately does not happen. Time and again in Dublin City, which is where I know best, we see commercial pubs still getting crowds while prices might be far lower in clubs. That is why I support the relaxation of the regulations governing clubs provided for in the Minister's legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not rule out moves being made by the Government to address these issues. We must examine a range of measures to see how best the matter can be tackled. Price orders were referred to, but in the past they have not had the desired effect, are amazingly complex and are usually withdrawn, as Deputy Rabbitte is aware. Therefore, price orders will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I agree that competitive forces are necessary and we will do all we can in that regard.</P>

      <P>Does he agree that the Government's opposition to the increase in inflation lacks all credibility because of the gross under staffing of the Competition Authority, the body responsible for ensuring competition? The Government talks the talk but will not walk the walk in terms of issuing additional pub licences. The Government's approach is meaningless because the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy is parading on the front of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> saying he will issue more licences while he will not table additional amendments to the legislation being put through the House to give effect to that threat. If the Minister was serious he could amend the Bill before the Dáil today to give effect to his threat. However, publicans see the threat has no meaning because amendments are not being tabled by the Government to bring about further liberalisation of licensing in light of inflation.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the areas of profiteering are the areas of restricted supply? There is a restricted supply of licensed outlets for drink, of petrol retail outlets because of planning legislation resulting in profiteering and there is not any price competition, and in the area of taxis there is not any effective price competition. The Government, and in particular the Taoiseach, is unwilling in the case of taxis to take the necessary action to increase supply and thereby reduce prices.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree we are now facing an emergency in terms of inflation, that our inflationary problems are beginning to be of concern to our colleagues in Europe and that inward investment will be adversely affected unless the supply side of the economy is made more efficient? Does he agree that in addition to asking NESC to recommend immediate action on increased retail outlets for drink, petrol and in other areas where profiteering exists, that he should ask them to examine the housing market where there are artificial restrictions on supply because of the planning system and its operation, which is creating a crisis for young couples who want to get a house and who cannot do so in a country with plenty of land? This is not the Netherlands where there is no land upon which to build houses &ndash; there is a plentiful supply of land, and the fact we cannot build enough houses for those who need them is a political failure. We have the land and can bring in the builders if necessary. We have the technology for providing water and sewerage systems. Houses are not being built because of supply, which is a political problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton is aware, the third Bacon report is currently before the Government. I appreciate the help of the House in concluding the Planning and Development Bill, <Col N="17" /> upon which we had a long debate and which will be very helpful if we are to do something effective, as I accept Deputies of all parties want to do. We can help by completing the debate on the Bill brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. There are also other local government changes.</P>
      <P>Regarding houses, we must continue to make changes to facilitate and try to improve supply. Two years ago we were told that if we built about 37,000 new houses we would be well ahead of what the market requires. We now have 44,000 houses being built and we are told we need a substantially increased number. There is a capacity issue in terms of what the industry can do. Already, there is an input from a large number of construction workers as can readily be seen throughout the country, but it is not easy to reach a figure of 50,000 houses. Of the £11 billion spent last year in the housing and residential sector, about £5 billion was not linked to loans, so it was speculative involvement by people buying property, increasing rents and putting more pressure on young people in terms of rents and in terms of squeezing them out of the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Supply must be addressed, but there is an issue of capacity. It is not a question of land, but of the ability to increase the figure from 31,000 to in excess of 50,000 new houses in a very short period, or when one adds local authority houses, in excess of 60,000 houses. The industry is driving towards that, and the measures we are introducing are aimed at that increased number.</P>

      <P>We have the serviced land initiative and the sewerage programme. The figure has increased from 31,000 to 45,000 new houses so the number being built has clearly increased. If one looks at the figures it is happening everywhere but the number is still not in excess of 50,000. The objective of the measures the Government is implementing is to drive investors out of the market and give first-time buyers the advantage. The Government is also looking at the private rented sector. That is what we need to do to increase supply to in excess of 50,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is standing economic logic on its head to say that one will increase the supply of something by driving investment out of the area in which an <Col N="18" /> increase in supply is sought? Yet, that is what the Government is seeking to do. Does the Taoiseach agree that the obstacle to building houses is not that there are too many people willing to invest in them but that there is too great a delay in the planning system and the provision of water and sewerage to sites for houses and too great an extent of profiteering on the part of builders sitting on sites in anticipation of further inflation in the value of those sites? Does the Taoiseach agree that if there was to be a major increase in supply many builders would sell the sites on which they are sitting quickly before the price fell, that the best way of releasing those sites is to put money into the provision of water and sewerage to additional sites and that the provision of additional serviced land will drive down the price of building land and increase supply? That is the way to go, rather than the mistaken mercantilist approach being adopted by the Taoiseach which goes back to the economics of Colbert and does not take account of more modern economic thinking since the 18th century.</P>

The econ<Col N="20" /> omy is growing strongly at a rate of between 8% and 10%. Almost half of those who invested in the residential market last year were able to buy property without having to take out a bank loan. In this small country £5 billion is a hell of a lot of money. This is a major factor. They would have accounted for only a small percentage a few years ago. They have moved in at the expense of first-time buyers. It is a fact of life and must be dealt with. The policies of the Government are aimed at increasing supply. Two years ago we were told that 45,000 would be enough. We are now being told that, between local authority and private sector housing, over 60,000 are required. This represents an enormous increase which we must try to facilitate but it cannot be done overnight.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The authorised officer completed the report into Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, on 31 May and I received the report on 1 June.</P>
      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing in my Department under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. I expect to receive final reports on all these companies in the coming months.</P>
      <P>My decision in mid-1998 to appoint an authorised officer to examine the books and documents of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, remains suspended pending the outcome of judicial review proceedings. This was the subject of a recent High Court hearing which concluded on 6 June. I expect the judgment in the case to be made at the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> Three companies are being investigated by High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are National Irish Bank Limited, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. In the latter case the High Court on 7 June approved an application by the three Ansbacher inspectors to seek access to certain company documentation in the Cayman Islands relevant to their inquiry. I expect each of these inquiries to be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated the investigation reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have no information on the intentions of the Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to any of these reports.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I respect and commend her for all these investigations which she has set up, but will she share my concern at the length of time it is taking to complete these reports? I have a series of answers here from month after month when I raised this question and there seems to be a similarity in many of the answers as time goes by. Has there been any communication between her Department and the DPP with regard to two of the inquiries, those relating to the NIBF and Bula Resources, which were sent to him in June and July 1998, which is almost two years ago, and the Garuda inquiry, which went to him in June 1999, according to her answer in February last? What is happening to those inquiries? I realise the Minister cannot ask the DPP what he will do about them, but is there any action she can take to bring those inquiries to an end? Otherwise the system of inquiries, which she initiated and for which she is to be commended, will begin to be discredited.</P>

      <P>The reports which are completed have gone to the Revenue Commissioners and I understand that they are pursuing vigorously the information included in them. The IIB report, for example, is five volumes long. The authorised officer did enormous work on that extensive report. He was able to find extraordinary information. Therefore it would be wrong to say that these reports are taking a long time. The tribunals of inquiry have been sitting for three years and these things take longer than one would wish, as the Deputy will be aware, because of legal complications, etc.</P>
      <P>It would be improper of me or my Department to seek to interfere with or contact the Director of Public Prosecutions about the reports which have been sent to him. He is an independent officeholder and, as the Deputy will be aware, we cannot query the exercise of his functions. Therefore I have no way of finding out whether he has decided to initiate prosecutions other than the normal way in which we find out these things.</P>

At this stage does she believe that this will come into the public domain while she is the Minister in charge in the lifetime of what is a rickety Government?

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the matters coming into the public domain, as the Deputy will be aware I am precluded by section 21 of the 1990 Act from bringing information into the public domain. Section 19 is a very preliminary inquiry, but of course the affidavit which went to the court to seek the appointment of the section 8 inspectors in the Ansbacher inquiry was fairly convincing in itself and clearly some information is in the public domain through that forum. I expect the report of the inspectors later this year. Since that would be a High Court report, clearly that would be a public matter.</P>
      <P>I expect much of this to come into the public domain during the lifetime of the Government. The IIB report is now completed and I will make a decision over the next couple of days, following discussions later this week with my legal advisers, as to how to move on the authorised officer's five-volume report.</P>
      <P>I have not made any decision on Bovale Limited. That is the subject of the Flood tribunal. Certainly evidence has not been brought to me in the way it has been regarding the other matters which came as a result of inquiries we had carried out, but clearly I have an open mind about any company. I have never shown a reluctance, where wrongdoing is suspected or if there are strong grounds for suspecting that a company is not run in accordance with the Companies Acts or is being run in a way to defraud other persons, to initiate an inquiry. In all, there have been 13 inquiries over the past three years, some of which have been completed and others of which are ongoing.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that there would be final reports in the coming months. Will she be more specific? Does she have information in respect of any of these individual inquiries where she can state with reasonable certainty when they will be concluded?</P>
      <P>In respect of her answer about information coming into the public domain, is she stating that it is only in respect of section 8 inquiries and through the medium of the courts that the information will come into the public domain? There is considerable concern that if she were no longer in office, many of these inquiries might die within the bowels of the Department. Can she assure the House that the information, which she promised in so many fulsome interviews as far back as 1998-99 and on a number of occasions since, will come into the public domain?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte will be aware, I am precluded from putting information into the public domain myself because of the powers in the 1990 Act. Those powers are restricted for good reason because they are preliminary investigations. Therefore the section 8 format through the High Court inspectorate is the way in which much of this information can be put into the public domain. Indeed, Deputy Rabbitte had experience in this area himself.</P>
      <P>I expect all the reports on the companies which my authorised officer is currently investigating to be completed over the next few weeks. The obvious course of action on those which require further action is a section 8 inspection. In order to convince the court that such an inspection is warranted, it is obvious that one must prepare an affidavit and put forward some of the information which one has uncovered through the section 19 process, but I expect that both the Ansbacher-Cayman investigation, in which the former Chief Justice, Mr. Costello, and two others are involved, and the NIB investigation will be completed towards the end of this year.</P>

      <P>How much in total has been spent in carrying out all these investigations? If the Minister does not have the detail to hand, perhaps she will let me have a tally of the expenditure to date. If at the end of the month she loses in the Dunnes challenge to what the media refer to as the Minister's &ldquo;probe&rdquo;, does she envisage any changes in legislation because she has failed already in one court and there is a retrial going on in the High Court? Have any lacunas in the legislation been revealed and, if so, have any decisions been made about them?</P>

    <Col N="24" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not actually fail in one court. I was not happy with the restrictive nature of the decision made in that court and that is why, on appeal, it was decided that the case should be reheard. It is actually a rehearing of the Dunnes case.</P>
      <P>The costs are negligible &ndash; I think I previously gave the figures here. It is certainly less than £2 million. The only costs involved are those where we have had to engage lawyers for court actions or to defend the position we adopted. I expect, as I stated previously, to be able to recoup all those costs when the section 8 inquiries are completed. We had the power to seek to make those who were the subject of the inquiry pay for the costs. It is reasonable that the companies which required an inquiry to a section 8 level should be responsible for the costs. I will be seeking the court's permission that the costs will be covered by the companies involved.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to introduce legislation in this area. However, the new company law enforcement Bill, which I hope will be published shortly, will provide for an independent process for conducting inquiries of this nature in order that it will not depend on political decisions. It should be done on an independent basis and should not require a political decision before company investigations of this nature take place.</P>

      <Quest> the details of the arrangements for the issuing of work permits to fill the skills shortages in our economy; the number of staff available in her Department to deal with the issuing of work permits in general; the number of permits that have been issued since October 1999 to date; the average length of time for the issuing of each permit; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for work permits to employ non-European Economic Area nationals in the State are made to my Department by employers in the first instance. Permits are generally granted where the employer concerned can demonstrate that they have been unable to recruit an Irish or other EEA national for the position or positions concerned and where the relevant immigration and labour law requirements are met.</P>
      <P> At present, a total of nine full-time and three part-time staff in my Department are engaged in the issuing of work permits. Since 1 October 1999 over 6,100 work permits have been issued. This is comparable to a figure of 4,200 in the corresponding period of the preceding year. The length of time taken to process an application for a work permit will always depend on the individual circumstances of the case concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The target time for dealing with applications last year was four weeks. Since the beginning of <Col N="25" /> this year, however, there has been a doubling in the number of applications received and, as a result, the time taken to process individual applications has increased to six weeks. Immediate steps have been taken to deal with this increase, including overtime arrangements and the assignment of extra staff to the work permit section of the Department. It is my intention in the short-term to reduce the average processing time to under four weeks and ultimately to two weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the average waiting time now is eight weeks and not six or four weeks? Will she tell me why no one in the section is available to answer the telephone? I realise the nine full-time and three part-time people must process the applications. Is the Minister aware that an increasing number of people get an answering machine every time they ring the work permits section? Will she tell the House whether she has instituted a system whereby employers now only receive a quota of workers? If an employer applies for work permits for ten non-EEA workers and he or she only has ten people working in the company, will the Minister say why that person is not allowed to bring in the ten workers if that is what he or she needs? I have been told a quota system is in operation. I do not know if such a system is intentional or not.</P>
      <P>What protection exists for employers who bring workers in to the country under the visa system where those workers, having arrived in Ireland with the visas, leave the company and go to work somewhere else and the staff in the work permits section demand that the employer who brought them in return the visas which are now cancelled? What guarantee exists that we are getting workers to fill the skills shortages or is the system being abused so that people can enter the country and move around from one sector to another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Two different situations are involved. Under the working visa system which we introduced a number of months ago and which is now being implemented a person can obtain a work visa for two years. They are not committed to stay with the company in relation to which they originally obtained the visa and it would be unreasonable to expect us&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they committed to staying in the same sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he or she is in the information technology sector they are committed to remaining in that sector. It is done on the basis of professional qualifications and they are being granted to engineers, planners, architects, IT professionals and nurses. We have not extended it beyond those categories for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards work permits, individual companies have complained to me and, after having investigated their complaints, I have found that the fault has lain with the companies in 95% of the cases. <Col N="26" /> For example, if a person does not have a visa to enter Ireland I am not in a position to allow them to enter with just a work permit. They must obtain certification from the Garda Síochána and so on. Difficulties would arise where an address would be given and the Garda could not vouch for the fact that the person was living at that address. That would be in the case of a person who had been here before and had had a permit. There has been a great deal of publicity about the situation in Galway where a company told people to come to Ireland, to tell the authorities when they arrived that they were visitors and to then apply for the permits. We cannot allow people to encourage others to break the law.</P>
    <P>I am not aware the telephone was not answered in that section of the Department, but new staff were recently assigned to it and the section is working extremely hard. I am sure most employers are satisfied with the service they receive. We must be vigilant. We must ensure Irish nationals are not being done out of a job. There have been situations where almost no effort was made to employ Irish staff and an effort was made to bring in non-national staff and pay them a great deal less than might have been paid to Irish employees. We must assess each case on the basis of its merits to ensure people do not seek to avoid their responsibilities by bringing in others when unemployed Irish people could do the jobs.</P>

      <P>In the 12 month period 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2000 a total of 6,823 inspections for compliance with labour legislation were carried out by the labour inspectorate of my Department. These inspections break down between the various Acts as follows: Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990 &ndash; 1,657; Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 &ndash; 1,724; Payment of Wages Act, 1991 &ndash; 1,732; Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 &ndash; 1,454; National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 &ndash; 245; Employment Agencies Act, 1971 &ndash; 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the same period the number of cases of infringement involving referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal action against offending employers was 14. Court hearings during the period in question of prosecution actions taken by my Department in respect of offences under <Col N="27" /> employment legislation numbered nine, all of which resulted in the conviction of the employers involved. Apart from these cases, the labour inspectorate recovered arrears of wages or holiday pay owing to employees as a result of underpayments made to them by their employers in the year June 1999 to May 2000 to the amount of £261,766.</P>

That Bill has a completely different function to this Bill and provides incentives to help the development of towns of a particular size. I will not go into the provisions of that Bill. The Minister and the Department are unable to produce a usable definition or concept of sustainable development for the Planning and Development Bill yet are able to produce a Town Renewal Bill aimed at promoting sustainable development.</P>
    <P>My argument, which is straightforward, unsophisticated and unabstruse, is that if we can talk about sustainable development in the context of the Town Renewal Bill and the development of towns, surely we can do so in the context of the Planning and Development Bill. All developments which take place with the aid of tax incentives will have to go through the normal planning process with which this Bill, by and large, sets out to deal. I support Government action and legislation which offers tax incentives designed to promote sustainable development in towns with a population between, and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, 500 and 6,000. However, surely we can make sustainable development part of all planning legislation and not just that part of it affected by tax and other incentives being made available to these towns.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department have shot down the case they made on Committee Stage. If we can include provisions promoting sustainable development in certain towns in the Town Renewal Bill, we can talk in reasonable terms about putting the idea, concept and promotion of sustainable development at the heart of planning legislation. This Bill is updating, revising and amending planning legislation and there is no case for not including reference to sustainable development. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I would be concerned if the Minister does not accept the amendment and it would be extraordinary if the reason for not accepting it concerns the definition of sustainable development. Deputy Gilmore provided a definition and I have no doubt the combined wisdom of the Department could improve on that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a statement about how we as a society view development. It should not simply <Col N="38" /> become another planning Act passed without recognition in the Title of the fact that we now understand more about the positive and negative aspects of development. The Bill should make it clear that we have a political and almost an ethical perspective on development and how it needs to be regulated, encouraged and controlled, depending on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; is universally understood and the Minister is making a statement by refusing to adopt a guiding principle accepted across the world. This is particularly the case in a Western society capable of truly adhering to principles of sustainable development. The Minister promotes himself as progressive and intent on leaving a legacy, but it is worrying if he is unable to make a modest amendment to the Title of the Bill which sets out the context within which legislators, local public representatives, officials and communities can work under the fundamental principle of sustainable development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and, like Deputy Dukes, urge the Minister to accept it. It is crucial that the Title incorporates the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;. The Minister said he does not have a definition of sustainable development. As he is aware, the term has many definitions, the most famous of which is the Brundtland one, which states that sustainable development is development which meets the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations. Future generations will ask why in the year 2000 a Government, whose members professed to be progressive and interested in sustainability, omitted that word from the Title of this Bill. My definition of &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; is development that improves the quality of life for present and future generations.</P>
      <P>We had a good debate during questions to the Taoiseach when Deputy Burton put forward his ideas on a quality of life index and Deputy Quinn also made a good contribution. In response to a question I put on that matter, the Taoiseach said the Government was committed to sustainability but, as in the case of the Minister, he was not sure how to go about introducing a quality of life index. This relates to the exclusion of environmental NGOs from social partnership. They need to be part of the equation. If they were, that would highlight the Government is truly committed to the notion of sustainability.</P>
      <P>Sustainability has become a buzz word and I have noticed the Minister peppers his speeches with it. Yet when it comes to the crunch, he has not included the word in what is probably one of the most important environmental Bills to go through this House in the three years the Government has been in office and for a number of years prior to that, given that, as Deputy McManus said, it will set the context for future planning and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is sending out a signal that it is not genuinely interested in sustainable develop<Col N="39" /> ment. I have read documents from the Department that state the Government is committed to sustainable development, as it will improve the eco-efficiency of our motorways. That strikes me as a contradiction in terms. The problem is there is a contradiction in the Government's approach to this area. It talks about sustainability, but introduces a national plan that is not sustainable. We have phenomenal economic growth but very serious environmental problems. The Government has not come up with an answer. The reason it has not is that the sustainability agenda it professes to have is in tatters. It does not exist.</P>
    <P>The Government will not include the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; in the Title because a case could be brought to court challenging a development that is not sustainable. I would like the Minister to respond to that point. It would be terribly remiss not to include that word in the Title.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline his definition of &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo;. What definitions has he considered and why does he consider the word cannot be incorporated in the Title? Public-private partnerships are dealt with in later sections and too many shortcuts are being taken in this area. That is part of the unsustainability agenda of the Government. How could an incinerator that a public-private partnership proposes to put in place or the planned motorways be called sustainable? How can the Minister claim they will be sustainable? Is he admitting the national plan put forward by the Government is not ecologically sustainable? </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion on this matter in the Seanad and on Committee Stage when I indicated I would reconsider whether the Short Title should be amended to the &ldquo;Planning and Sustainable Development Bill&rdquo;. Having reconsidered it, I am of the view that it would be wrong to change the Title.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes illustrated my point when he mentioned that the term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; is referred to in the Town Renewal Bill, sustainable development of towns with a population ranging from 500 to 6,000 being one of its core aims. Deputy Dukes's point which emphasised that this will not be the only Bill that will deal with sustainable development underlines the reason for my decision on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill relates primarily to land use for planning purposes and does not cover the much broader concepts associated with sustainable development in its entirety. That is an important point. In line with Government policy and its international commitments to infuse the concept of sustainable development across all sectors, to entitle this Bill, the &ldquo;Planning and Sustainable Development Bill&rdquo; could give rise to the impression that the job of implementing sustainable development principles has been <Col N="40" /> finalised. In other words, it could be assumed that such principles are all contained in this Bill, which is not the case. Such an interpretation would make the proposed Title misleading.</P>
    <P>This amendment is related to Deputy Gilmore's amendment, which proposes to insert a definition of sustainable development in the Bill. As I said on Committee Stage, the phrase &ldquo;proper planing and sustainable development&rdquo; is included in the Bill. In drafting the Bill and since Committee Stage, given the strong views expressed on this matter on that Stage, a good deal of thought has been given to question of defining sustainable development. The concept of sustainable development is so dynamic and all-embracing that any legal definition would tend to restrict or stifle it or, alternatively, we could end up with a definition that would be so vague that it would cause endless difficulties to those working within the planning system.</P>
    <P>In response to what Deputy Gormley said, the inclusion of such a definition could encourage a raft of legal challenges to development plans and the granting of planning permissions. The Deputy mentioned the Brundtland definition of sustainable development, but there are many more definitions. There have been enough legal loopholes in planning and development law down through the years and I do not intend to introduce any more in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with proper planning and sustainable development. Sections 10(2)(<i>a</i>), 10(2) (<i>d</i>) and 34(2) refer to proper planning and sustainable development. We have tried to weave the concept of sustainable development into the fabric of the Bill and to give effect to it in practical ways. For example, section 10 provides that the development objectives to be contained in development plans will cover the environmental concerns people have in this modern age. They include enhanced opportunities for the public to participate in planning for their localities through the local area plans; environmental assessment of regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans contained within the Bill; new environmental measures to protect the landscape; simple tree preservation orders; measures to facilitate the protection of public rights of way, the comprehensive protection of our architectural heritage, and so on. All those objectives are different aspects of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to accept these amendments, as the concept of sustainable development permeates the Bill. It is preferable to provide for sustainable development in that way in the Bill rather than to include a narrow definition of it that could give rise to problems later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used a great number of words but what they boil down to is that the Government is afraid of what is involved in undertaking a commitment to sustainable development. For that reason it does not want to insert it into the Bill. That is the reason we are <Col N="41" /> going backwards in terms of meeting targets on greenhouse gas emissions, that the Minister is unable to tell the House the date by which no more raw sewage will be pumped out of towns into the watercourses and the reason he is unable to tell the House a whole series of other things about the protection of the environment. The Minister has given the weakest response that could possibly be imagined. He is afraid that if &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; is included in the Title of the Bill, people will get the impression that only this Bill deals with sustainable development. How in God's name can the Minister make that as an argument? How can he pretend for an instant that if we say that this Bill deals with planning and sustainable development there is not other legislation to do with sustainable development? This Bill has to do with planning. Basically it is a land use Bill. We all know there are many other areas that require legislation where the concept of sustainable development will have to be repeated. To put that description in the Title of the Bill would not alter it. To put a definition in the Bill would not give rise to the impression that this is the only place where we need to do it. It would not restrict or stifle the concept of sustainable development. What I am worried about &ndash; and, I think, all of this side of the House &ndash; is that we have already restricted&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that. There is much more I wanted to say. The Minister, by including references to sustainable development in sections 10(2)<i>(a)</i> and 10(2)<i>(d)</i>, is making my point for me. He is saying there are cases where this definition can be used. There is no reason it should not be put in the Title and there is no reason for not accepting Deputy Gilmore's amendment because that is the definition that has been accepted by Governments as a basis for, among other things, the Kyoto agreement. I am pressing this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to international commitments. We have signed up to international commitments but in many instances we have not complied with those commitments, in particular, the Kyoto agreement, with which <Col N="42" /> we have not a hope of complying. Given that our CO2 emissions are going through the roof we will be faced with a large bill. The United States has not ratified but the EU will ratify and we will find ourselves in a difficult position not only in respect of international agreements but even within the context of the EU. The Minister knows that. Yet we are sending out a signal today that when it comes to sustainable development we will not take it too seriously. We will incorporate it into certain sections of the Bill. The Minister's argument in itself is not sustainable. He said that if it is included in this Bill we would cut ourselves away from other aspects and that we should not broaden the argument. I believe sustainability should be part of many different Bills, but that is not an argument. He may be afraid, and he has confirmed that he would face legal challenges. He will face legal challenges regardless. The more watertight a definition, the better. On the one hand, the Minister mentioned sustainable development in section 10. Is the Minister saying he is not afraid in that instance of facing a legal challenge and yet if it is not included in the Title that that will not happen? That seems a slight contradiction.</P>

The definition proposed by Deputy Gilmore, amendment No. 16, is the internationally accepted definition. It is what Governments have in mind when they adopt measures such as the Kyoto convention or other environmental measures. There is nothing in it that would cause a problem for planners here that would not already be caused, if problems are caused, by sections 10(2)<i>(a)</i> and 10(2)<i>(d).</i> I urge the Minister to confirm that the Government believes in the concept of sustainable development and to insert it in the Title and in the definitions section. I urge him to accept it and to get on with the rest of the Bill. If that is done we will have done a good day's work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 14, after &ldquo;structure,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;dirigible,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also discussed this matter on Committee Stage. The purpose of the amendment is to insert &ldquo;dirigible&rdquo; in the Bill's definition of advertisement which means &ldquo;any word, letter, model, balloon, inflatable structure, kite, poster, notice, <Col N="45" /> device or representation..&rdquo;. As I explained on Committee Stage, I wish to insert dirigible because there are objects which are similar to balloons but have their own motive power. A dirigible is a balloon which has one or more engines which allows it to move around. The ones which immediately come to mind, although they are bad examples, are the R101 and the<i> Hindenburg</i>. There are currently in production dirigibles which frequently have an advertisement attached or painted on the side. Does the Minister's definition of balloon include that?</P>
    <P>The Minister's inclusion of balloons and inflatable structures means that one will have to get planning permission to send up a tethered balloon with an advertisement because it is not an exempted development. If the balloon is not tethered but can move around, and is therefore a dirigible, should it not require the same permission? This would seem to follow the logic of the section. I hope the Minister does not shoot this amendment down in flames.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and thank Deputy Dukes for explaining what a dirigible is. I asked one of my colleagues about ten minutes ago and with great certainty, he explained it meant directional. I will have to tell Deputy Rabbitte he is not always right.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether it is absolutely necessary to include this term, but it is probably better than leaving it out. When we talk about dynamic in terms of sustainable development, there is nothing more dynamic than the advertising world. Advertising is an aspect of life which is becoming increasingly intrusive. There are often instances where the restrictions of the Planning Act would be immensely helpful in protecting the public interest and keeping some kind of control on advertising. It would be advisable for the Minister to accept this amendment to be on the safe side. It may have to be amended in the future for some other form of creative advertising impulse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes seeks to include the word &ldquo;dirigible&rdquo; in the definition of advertisement. We discussed this on Committee Stage when I explained that the dictionary definition of a dirigible is &ldquo;a navigable balloon or airship&rdquo;, in other words, one that can be directed or moved around. Deputy Rabbitte was in the ballpark when he said it meant directional. If a balloon or airship-shaped advertisement is being used, it is well covered by the definition which states that an advertisement means, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;any balloon, inflatable structure, device or representation employed for the purpose of advertisement&rdquo;. That definition is more than adequate and covers the Deputy's concern. The problem with expanding the definition and accepting the Depu<Col N="46" /> ty's amendment is that it would give the impression that flying an airship would require planning permission, which I am sure would not be the Deputy's intention. For that reason and because the definition is sufficiently wide, I cannot accept this amendment. I ask the Deputy to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 21, after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;turbary,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to ensure that turf production is included in the definition of what constitutes exempted development. The Minister will probably reply that his amendment No. 23 will give him the power to exempt any class of development for reasons connected with its size, nature, limited effect on surroundings, etc. As the Minister explained on Committee Stage, he would prefer to have turf production outside the scope of exempted developments, in other words, to be a regulated activity, and to use the powers proposed in amendment No. 23 to exempt small scale turf production. I am not happy with that. I would be much happier if we were to classify turf production, like agriculture, as an exempt development and for the Minister to have the power to include in the planning laws developments over a certain size, in other words, to turn his amendment No. 23 on its head. I would be much happier if the presumption was that turf production is always an exempt development and that large-scale turf production could be regulated, rather than what the Minister proposes in the Bill, where all turf production comes under the requirements of the planning laws but the Minister may exempt certain smallscale developments.</P>
      <P>The reason for that is very simple. Substantial numbers of people around the country derive a certain amount of their income from turf production. There are also people who derive no income from turf production but cut turf for their own use. Other people make their livelihoods by cutting turf for other people but do not, in any real sense, market turf on a large scale. There are also people whose sole business for a substantial part of the year is contracting to cut turf for the owners of the turf banks as their fuel supply for the winter. We should not make life any more difficult for those people or give them the impression it will be made any more difficult. They will be worried by the Minister's proposals in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we adopt the course proposed by the Minister, where turf production falls under all the provisions of the planning law but he can exempt certain types or sizes of activity, we will inevitably have arguments about where the line should be drawn. It can be taken as given that, wherever one draws the line, somebody will be on the wrong side of it. That would be unnecessarily <Col N="47" /> acrimonious and divisive. However, if we do it the other way around, make turf production an exempted activity and give the Minister powers, notwithstanding that general exemption, to apply controls in a certain way, it will be much easier to get agreement and understanding, and the people who are being regulated will have far less of an argument to make than the many people who should remain unregulated.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that the Minister intends to do his best under the procedure he proposes to meet the kind of case that I and some of my colleagues have been making. However, I think that will be an unnecessarily difficult and acrimonious procedure. It would be far better if the Minister accepted my proposal to make turf production generally an exempted development and to take powers to specify, notwithstanding that exemption, that certain scales of activity are subject to regulation. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Dukes's amendment. We had quite a detailed debate on this issue on Committee Stage. Turbary rights were copper-fastened in the 1963 Act. These are traditional rights that have been handed down from generation to generation and are vested in the Land Registry in Setanta Place and the Four Courts. People have been entitled for generations to cut turf on bogs, whether the bogs belong to the State or another landowner.</P>
      <P>We are talking about smallscale domestic or commercial production. These people have invested a lot of money in equipment over the years. Contractors have moved away from the sausage machine, which everyone agrees damages the bogs, and towards the hopper, which does not damage the bog or aquifer and maintains the ecosystem in the bogs. We are not talking about hundreds of thousands of acres of lands. Most of these people own one acre plots of bog, half of which have been cut out at this stage. Therefore, we are left with approximately half acre plots on the edges of bogs. Whether these people will be exempted from planning permission will depend on what regulations the Minister introduces.</P>
      <P>Dúchas is now saying that, under its guidelines, a landowner will be allowed cut only 15 hoppers of turf, which is approximately two and a half spreads of turf. Is the Minister laying down the same guidelines and regulations for turf cutting under the Bill? Anyone who cuts over two and a half spreads of turf will have to seek planning permission from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning process in Roscommon is chaotic at the moment, as I am sure it is in every other local authority. It takes a minimum of four months for an application to go through. We are now adding further bureaucracy which will delay the planning process. While the Bill is supposed to improve the planning process, it will actually slow it down if every turf cutter in County Ros<Col N="48" /> common has to apply for planning permission to cut three or more spreads of turf.</P>
    <P>The Minister will destroy the livelihoods of many people throughout the country who traditionally cut turf over the years for sale on a small commercial basis. A number of people reared their families and put them through college on the income they earned from turf cutting. This livelihood is now in jeopardy under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes has proposed a solution to the problem, which is to exempt turf cutting generally and restrict large-scale production. We all accept there are problems with large-scale production and the current guidelines. However, why should a small producer be crucified under this legislation? The Bill is taking away people's democratic rights under the Constitution and Land Registry laws and leaving them high and dry. The requirement to seek planning permission will cause immense bureaucratic difficulties, due to the need to refer it to Dúchas and so on, and might take so much time that the cutting season would be lost in a particular year. I ask the Minister to review the situation, think of the livelihoods that could be destroyed by the Bill and accept Deputy Dukes's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not get too carried away about the effect of what I am proposing. Deputy Naughten's passionate plea for the turf cutters of Roscommon and other parts of the country would be echoed on both sides of the House. If we were going to do what the Deputy thinks or says we will, those people would have a right to be concerned, but that is not our intention.</P>
      <P>If we had an absolutely free hand and there was no problem about this, I would be very sympathetic to Deputy Dukes's approach. However, what he is proposing is what applies currently and we have to change it because of a European Court of Justice ruling. The situation under current legislation, probably for all the reasons stated by the Deputies opposite, is that peat extraction involving over 50 hectares requires planning permission and an EIA.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice, in September 1999, determined that Ireland had exceeded its discretion in setting the EIA threshold for peat extraction at 50 hectares because this failed to take into account the nature and location of lesser sized projects. The Irish exemption was based solely on an area and, because the planning and the EIA thresholds are the same, there was no scope for planning authorities to consider such issues as, for example, the nature and location of commercial projects under the EIA threshold. As turbary at that time was exempted development under the 1963 Act, it could only be brought within the planning system where it exceeded the EIA threshold of 50 hectares. That was and still is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Court noted in its judgment that even smallscale projects can have significant effects on the environment if they are in a <Col N="49" /> location where the environmental factors set out in Article 3 of the directive, such as fauna and flora, soil, water, climate or cultural heritage, are sensitive to the slightest alteration. In addition, the court pointed to the fact that no project for the extraction of peat in Ireland had been the subject of an EIA although &ldquo;smallscale peat extraction has been mechanised industrialised and considerably intensified, resulting in the unremitting loss of areas of bog of nature conservation importance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a result of that judgment there is a need to re-examine the current exemptions for projects under 50 hectares under both the planning and the EIA codes. With regard to planning, the approach envisaged under this Bill is, first, to de-exempt peat extraction as we are required to do and, second, to make provision in regulations under section 4(2)(<i>a</i>) for an exemption for domestic turf cutting and smallscale peat extraction of a commercial nature, such as Deputy Naughten mentioned. I assure the Deputy that the people for whom he is speaking are and will be covered under the regulations. Deputy Dukes will be delighted to know that the regulations will have to come before the House so there will be an opportunity to discuss them. Deputies will have an input. It is our intention to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have expressed fears for smallscale operations usually carried out for domestic purposes &ndash; we have already exchanged our individual stories about cutting turf when we were young &ndash; but that type of operation will not be affected, nor will the smallscale commercial operations described by Deputy Naughten which generate a commercial return to supplement income. It is the intention of most Deputies to ensure that those people remain unaffected. However, I must do it this way rather than maintain the current system. Otherwise, we will be back before the European Court of Justice. With regard to the EIA, I am examining the requirement to reduce the threshold of 50 hectares. This will address the concerns of the European Court in a transparent manner. When that is done there should be no further difficulty.</P>
    <P>Another point arose with regard to Dúchas. The guidelines put forward by Dúchas with regard to turf cutting relate to special areas of conservation, particularly sensitive landscapes and ecology. They are not relevant in a general sense. The special areas of conservation must be protected, we have no choice in that. It is right that we should protect them and all Members would support that sentiment.</P>
    <P>We are in this situation because turf cutting is currently exempt development. There is a European Court ruling in that regard and we must respond to it. This is the best way of doing so, notwithstanding the views expressed by Members, and the regulations will take full account of the Deputies' concerns. The smallscale operations will be preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that we must <Col N="50" /> do it this way. The European Court said that the system currently in place is not adequate and we must pay proper attention to what the court says, particularly since we appear to be one of the worst member states where the application of environmental legislation is concerned. Ireland is probably subject to more infringement proceedings than any other member state. That is nothing to be proud of.</P>
      <P>The court said the system currently in place is not satisfactory under the legislation. However, the court did not and cannot say what would be acceptable. That is not the court's business. My fear and the fear of the people most directly concerned with this matter is that if the procedure followed by the Minister is put into operation, it will affect people who are cutting turf on contiguous areas of bog. Somebody might say: &ldquo;We cannot just look at a series of separate independent operations but at the effect of all the activity on the area, whether that be 50 hectares or more&rdquo;. Since they will not have the protection of being exempted development, they will be caught in that net. That is the fear and it is a reasonable fear.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to special areas of conservation. Where there are particularly sensitive bog environments that is the way to deal with them. I do not pretend that it will be easy. It will be extremely contentious in some cases but that bullet must be bitten. Undoubtedly, there will be contention about many of them but that is the means by which we should preserve and protect certain areas.</P>
      <P>The real danger is that people who are traditional operators will not be looked on as individual operators but as a group by the European Court. That will put them back to square one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Dukes. The danger is that the entire bog rather than individual turbary rights would be taken into account. In the past much bog was taken over by Bord na Móna which, in turn, gave turbary rights to individuals. These people had given up their bog and obtained turbary rights in other areas. The State, through the semi-State body, was involved in this issue, which is another aspect of its responsibility. The Minister should be wary in this regard because I do not think too many European judges warm their shins by turf fires, given that not very many countries, apart from Ireland, cut turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied this problem will be solved by way of regulation because the interpretation of regulations when implemented is fundamental. Deputy Dukes made the point that the consolidation of a number of small plots may remove the area from being an exempted development. This is the nub of the issue in relation to the European courts. The issue of the consolidation of plots under 50 hectares which, when added together, were not exempted was taken up with the European courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the European courts are <Col N="51" /> telling us we cannot exempt bogs on an acreage basis. How does he intend to exempt smallscale production under the regulations and can he give us some idea of the type of smallscale production which will be exempted? Interpretation will be the crucial issue and the Minister may not be in charge when the regulations are drafted and implemented. He will not have to interpret the regulations, the enactment of which is the nub of the issue. In umpteen regulations which have been laid down in the past, the interpretation has varied from local authority to local authority and from Department to Department. I ask the Minister to consider the situation, exempt an acre or half a hectare and allow smallscale production to continue. The Minister should use the EIS to deal with large-scale producers of turf who are causing trouble but he should not crucify small producers whose livelihoods will be in serious trouble if these regulations are introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is in the top quartile of member states for transposing EU legislation. The EIA directive is the only one in relation to which this country was brought to court even though there are a number of complaints in relation to procedures. Our record is not as bad as stated but I acknowledge there have been a number of complaints and I do not know how many of these will go to court. I would say to <Col N="52" /> Deputy Belton that there is a slight possibility one of the judges in the court may have warmed his shins before a turf fire because he came from Scotland.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make a decision on the floor of the House on how large an area we will exempt. However, I assure Deputy Naughten that the people to whom he referred will fall below any guidelines put forward and will be adequately exempted under the regulations. Before we discuss the specifics of the issue, I do not wish to put a size on it. I think we are dealing with the issue in the best way possible. People are entitled to their point of view that it could be dealt with differently but I assure Deputies that their concerns will be met. In the unlikely event that I or one of my colleagues will not be Minister for the Environment and Local Government, one of the Deputy's colleagues will be in that position and will be able to deal with the issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 32, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including by electronic means&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are concerned with the use of the Internet and electronic means of communication in the planning process. When the Planning Bill, 1963, was introduced the assumption was that business would be transacted on paper. We are living in a new age when business can be transacted electronically. The process initiated under the 1963 Act whereby every planning application is placed in a paper file and has to be inspected in a planning office can be speeded up greatly by the submission of planning applications electronically and placing them on the council's website where they can be inspected by members of the public who should be in a position to make their comments and observations by e-mail. Similarly, the development plan process which involves extensive public consultation can also be enhanced by the use of electronic means of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments seek to make express provision for the use of electronic means of communication in the making of planning applications and in the public consultation process on <Col N="55" /> development plans. I am pleased to note the Minister has introduced his own amendment. I look forward to hearing his comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I tabled a series of amendments which involved a rather laborious procedure. I hope I am right in thinking that the Minister's amendment, No. 326, is the result of our discussion. It seems to meet my concerns and I commend it to the House. It has one element which is worth bearing in mind in this age of electronic means of communication. I attended a meeting of a different body earlier today at which a particular agency was urged not only to place certain information on its website but to include a number of individuals in the list of those who automatically receive by e-mail a copy of all the information placed on its website. I was appalled by this. Like most Members, if I could find a way of placing a filter on my e-mail I would do so. The trouble is that one has to define the source and e-mails come from all directions.</P>
      <P>It is probably politically incorrect and rather unfashionable to say this but e-mail is in serious danger of becoming the bane of our lives because we are inundated in a sea of these messages from every person who has a smart idea which we have probably heard 735 times before and because it is accessible. I find it appalling that every day I receive e-mails which contain an A4 size page of destinations in Leinster House. I used to laugh but now I give a tired sigh when following the list of a couple of hundred names I come to the part which reads that their contents are confidential and private to the addressees who include everybody who counts and many who do not, including myself, because they relate to matters about which I have no intention of doing anything. This promiscuity of communication will become more and more of a problem. If I have read it correctly the Minister's amendment at least contains a provision which states that in certain cases there may be a requirement to give information in electronic form but that the consent of the person receiving the document will be required. This is an important insertion for the sake of the sanity of various people in different parts of the public administration and even of parts of the private sector.</P>
      <P>If amendment No. 326 is the outcome of the discussion on Committee Stage, I am happy with it. I would ask the Minister to indicate the measures, if any, he is taking to encourage the local authorities to put themselves in a position to be able to act in the way which is set out in amendment No. 326.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to confirm that the amendment I table here is the direct result of the various amendments which both Deputies tabled on Committee Stage. It is designed to meet the requirements outlined clearly by the Deputies <Col N="56" /> and other Members to ensure that we are as e-friendly as possible.</P>
      <P>In tabling that amendment, I was conscious of two things. First, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is providing for a comprehensive system of e-government in the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, which is currently before the House, and anything which I would provide for in this Bill should parallel what is in that Bill, particularly as it deals with difficult issues like the security of signatures, etc.</P>
      <P>Second, under the aegis of the Local Government Computer Services Board innovative trials of technology are currently taking place in local authorities to examine how the new technology can be used and how it might revolutionise every aspect of the planning system, and not merely the publication of the materials themselves. The trials, as I indicated recently, are in their preliminary stages. It will obviously be some time before the technology can be extended to all of the planning authorities, but that is the intention. Kildare County Council is one of the local authorities to the forefront in developing the systems for the computer services board and for other local authorities.</P>
      <P>Even then, the paper and electronic systems must co-exist for many years for the sake of the people who are users of the system generally but who may not be familiar with laptop computers, PCs, the Internet, intranets, etc. We are some distance away from the day when paper applications will not be submitted to the planning authority.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputies that the current provisions in the Bill on technology use are too limited and need to be expanded, and that is the reason for the amendment. We had a long discussion on this on Committee Stage. That is why I tabled my amendment No. 326, to replace section 238.</P>
      <P>That new section provides that any written documents or other information can be provided or kept in electronic format from the date of commencement of the Bill without further need for regulations to be made permitting it. One critical proviso, which is reflected in the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, is that both sides must consent to the information concerned, whatever it may be, being in an electronic form. If the person getting information in an electronic format cannot open it or use it or if the person does not have the technology to be able to avail of it, there is little point in changing information to an electronic format.</P>
      <P>The technology requirements of the local authority or the board must be complied with and I do not propose to make them accept planning applications in any format. They must make known the requirements. That is necessary and practical for the introduction of e-planning and reflects the provisions in the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone as far as possible at this stage of the development of the introduction of electronic <Col N="57" /> format. I acknowledge the amendments proposed on Committee Stage by both Deputies Dukes and Gilmore. My amendment deals adequately with those and I ask the Deputies to accept that amendment and withdraw their amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) notified for the purposes of Regulation 4 of the European Com<Col N="58" /> munities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997), subject to any amendments made to it by virtue of Regulation 5 of those regulations, or</P>

    <P>(iii) added by virtue of Regulation 6 of the said regulations to the list transmitted to the Commission in accordance with Regulation 5(4) of the said Regulations,</P>
    <P>but only until the adoption in respect of the site of a decision by the Commission under Article 21 of the Habitats Directive for the purposes of the third paragraph of Article 4(2) of that Directive,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) a site adopted by the Commission as a site of Community importance for the purposes of Article 4(2) of the Habitats Directive in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of that Directive,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) a special area of conservation within the meaning of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) an area classified pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of Article 4 of the Birds Directive;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Arising from discussion at various Stages, I propose this amendment to the definition of a European site in order to ensure comprehensive protection to SACs and proposed SACs. The definition in the Bill, as published, is copied from the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, and it includes a special area of conservation, a site of community importance which is placed on the list referred to in Article 4 of the Habitats Directive &ndash; this is the list of Irish sites which has been sent to Brussels &ndash; as well as areas designated under the Birds Directive. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands was concerned that this definition did not cover sites which were proposed to be designated but had not yet been formally sent to the European Commission. Following consultation between the two Departments, agreement has been reached on amending the definition as now proposed.</P>
    <P>The main effect of the amendment is to ensure that protection is extended to proposed European sites once local authorities and landowners are notified of the proposal. I understand that a similar amendment will be proposed to the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House.</P>
    <P>This was the subject of considerable debate and amendments on Committee Stage and I am pleased to be in a position to table this amendment to meet the points made by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;material contravention' is where an application if granted would be in breach of a specific policy, or a specific objective and a specific zoning in a development plan, local area plan, an area of special amenity or a landscape conservation area;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the course of the Committee Stage debate we discussed the question of who decides whether a planning application is a material contravention of a development plan. The Minister confirmed to me that, as the legislation stands at present, that decision is an executive one made by the county manager. My argument is that the development plan is made by and is a reserved function of the elected members of a local authority. Therefore, they should have the same right as the county manager to decide by resolution at a county council meeting whether an application constitutes a material contravention of a development plan.</P>
      <P>I have recently encountered a number of cases where planning applications have been submitted, where the county manager has taken the view that the applications do not materially contravene the development plan and proceeds to make a decision on them, and where members of the local authority concerned who made the development plan in the first place have contended that the applications contravene the development plan and that, therefore, the procedure for material contravention should be initiated so that public consultation would take place on it and, ultimately, a decision made by members of the local authority whether it is at variance with the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this point because, as the Minister is aware, the courts have found that development <Col N="60" /> plans are contracts between the public and the local authority in the area of planning matters. It appears that those who make the development plan &ndash; the elected members of the local authority &ndash; should at least have the same call as the county manager as to whether an application is in contravention of the development plan. At present, once members of a local authority make the development plan, its subsequent interpretation, especially whether applications conform to it, are matters for the manager.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 82 seeks to give the same right to local authority members to decide by resolution if they consider an application materially contravenes a development plan. Amendment No. 10 is the definition amendment which relates to amendment No. 82.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendments. It is an issue we discussed on Committee Stage and I was not entirely convinced then that Deputy Gilmore was on the right track. On reflection and having consulted a number of my colleagues in local authorities, the problem he has mentioned, where there is a disagreement between local authority members and the manager as to what constitutes a material contravention in a certain case, is not uncommon. A provision of this nature would allow for a more effective means of intervention for local authority members than is currently available. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies acknowledged, we had a long discussion on this on Committee Stage and Deputy Gilmore has resubmitted his amendment to define &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill. He has also brought forward the amendment to provide that the decision on what is a material contravention can be taken by the manager or decided by a resolution of the elected members.</P>
      <P>I still believe strongly that we should not attempt to define &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;. The concept is well understood by all parties at this stage. To define and extend it as the Deputy seeks to do in the amendment would cause problems for planning authorities when they decide on planning applications, even when they are acting to provide infrastructure. One of the major dangers is that they would be liable to exclude items from the definition and cause more problems than are resolved.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that there have been disputes on material contraventions, as Deputies Gilmore and Dukes have stated. There have been and probably will continue to be occasional conflicts between the managers and the elected members on what is a material contravention. The amendment would merely create uncertainty. It states that either the manager or the councillors decide what is a material contravention. If there is a disagreement, who prevails?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A material contravention usually arises where a specific planning application is before the local <Col N="61" /> authority and where a section 4 direction is given to the manager. If he or she believes it is a material contravention, he or she then puts that procedure in place rather than accept the section 4 direction. The provisions have worked reasonably well notwithstanding that there have been and no doubt will be occasional conflicts. For that reason and because the system we have at present is tried and relatively trusted by all sides, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to withdraw the amendments. As the Minister said, conflict arises from time to time between local authority members and their county manager as to whether an application is a material contravention. The problem is that, when such conflict arises, the decision rests with the county manager. That is undemocratic and the decision should rest with the elected members, especially since it is they who make the development plan in the first place. I regret that the Minister is not disposed to accepting these amendments so I ask that they be put to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 19 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;statutory undertaker' means a person, for the time being, authorised by or under any enactment or instrument under an enactment to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) construct or operate a railway, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour or airport,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) provide, or carry out works for the provision of, gas, electricity or telecommunications services, or</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) provide services connected with, or carry out works for the purposes of the carrying on of the activities of, any public undertaking;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amended definition of &ldquo;statutory undertaker&rdquo; makes it clear that it includes those bodies which are, for the time being, authorised to carry out works. With deregulation, companies in areas such as telecommunications and gas will come and go and it was felt it might be useful to reflect that in the definition. This amendment is in response to an amendment Deputy Dukes tabled, amendment No. 21 to section 4, and I believe it meets this point. This amendment also provides that operators of airports can be considered statutory undertakers for their own works where they are authorised under statute.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment which would confine the definition of &ldquo;statutory undertaker&rdquo; to public bodies because, in an area of open competition, this would discriminate between companies competing for the same market and it would be unacceptable. As in a previous case about which we talked, we could even end up with Ireland being dragged before the European Court of Justice under competition laws, rules and so on. For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
      <P>My amendment meets some of the substantial points made by Deputy Dukes and others on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the amendment goes the distance proposed in my amendment and which I sought on Committee Stage. The problem is that when the original legislation was drawn up in 1963 and what are called &ldquo;statutory undertakers&rdquo; were permitted to carry out works without having to apply for planning permission, the number of statutory undertakers were, in the first place, very few and were all State owned, with <Col N="63" /> one exception, the Gas Company. Basically, it was the ESB, P&amp;T, as it then was, and the local authority doing water and sewerage works.</P>
      <P>In the era of deregulation, there is a multitude of such companies. We have a number of telephone companies and various television cabling companies. We will have a number of electricity companies and we have gas. We currently have one water authority but that may also change in the course of time. We know what is happening. There is not a day when the road is not dug up by one or other of those companies, and very often in sequence. This causes damage to the road infrastructure, which has been put down at considerable public cost, and it causes disruption to traffic and inconvenience to users of roads and so on. There is a need for this area to be more strongly regulated.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's amendment confines this activity to those who are authorised for the time being, but that still leaves quite a number of undertakers who will be authorised to carry out this work. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage &ndash; a route I strongly recommend and support &ndash; that separate legislation might be introduced to regulate this area. I urge him to speed up the introduction of that legislation because the process of deregulation is now under way. It is at this point that these companies are probably at their most active and many are trying to compete with each other and supply services to customers and so on. This is the point at which this will be needed.</P>
      <P>While recognising, I suppose, the <i>realpolitick</i>&ndash; it is the Minister's amendment which will be included in this Bill &ndash; I ask him to confirm to the House his intention to introduce legislation to regulate the activities of these bodies and to introduce that legislation sooner rather than later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm to Deputy Gilmore what I said on Committee Stage, that I strongly believe it will be necessary to have separate legislation to achieve what he is trying to achieve here. We will move ahead with that as quickly as possible. The Planning and Development Bill is not the place to deal comprehensively with the issue of road openings. I confirm that since Committee Stage, my Department has been in contact with the Dublin Transportation Office, the DTO, to assess, in consultation with the local authorities in the DTO area, the extent to which the approach taken to the opening and reinstatement of roads and paths for the installation of telecommunications infrastructure can be better managed. However, that is very much an interim thing and I confirm to Deputy Gilmore that it is my belief separate legislation is the route we will take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point the Deputy made about the importance of that being sooner rather than later. I cannot, however, give him any absolute assurances or guarantees as to the timescale because <Col N="64" /> this has arisen only since our discussion on Committee Stage, but we will try to expedite it.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am beginning to sound like the all-party committee. When does development commence? I have seen cases where a JCB rolls on to a site and somebody blows the whistle saying the developer has not yet got planning permission, it is still with An Bord Pleanála, he is on site and that he has started development. The developer maintains he is only clearing some of the rough growth at the edge of the site. That is a myth because everyone knows it is a signal of intent. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that work of that kind is considered development and should be defined as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly says, he raised this issue on Committee Stage. I investigated whether site investigation could be defined to prevent people using a perceived gap in the planning code. While I accept there were some incidents in the past where people attempted to abuse the section, from the information I have gleaned from local authorities it has not been a major problem and questions were rarely raised with the board regarding people straying from preparing the site to commencing development. If a developer begins to lay foundations he can be stopped. It is extremely difficult to define site preparation and it could lead to preventing reasonable activities such as clearing derelict sites. That might delay legal development. The Deputy argued in the past that site preparation is sometimes perceived by local people objecting to a planning application as a form of bullying, intimidation and giving the two fingers signal. However, I do not believe local authorities would be swayed one way or the other by such works. <Col N="65" /> Because of that and the difficulty with definition, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 26, to delete lines 16 and 17.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with exempted development. Amendment No. 18 would delete section 4(<i>b</i>) which exempts development by a local authority within its functional area. Amendment No. 20 would delete paragraph (<i>f</i>) which exempts development that is carried out in the functional area of a local authority on behalf of or in partnership with the local authority pursuant to a contract with the local authority.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage my main concern was with paragraph (<i>f</i>) which opens up the possibility that work being carried out in partnership with or on behalf of a local authority would be exempted development. In a way, paragraph (<i>b</i>) is the standard type of work in which a local authority engages &ndash; building a housing scheme, community facilities and so on. It gets approval for such work under Part X of the planning regulations which is being repeated in the Bill under another section.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>f</i>) opens up a range of areas under the public private partnership which will be exempt development for the purposes of the planning Acts, in other words they do not have to apply for planning permission. One could have a major development carried out by a private company under a contract or in partnership with a local authority and it does not need to apply for planning permission. That is not what was originally meant to be exempted development under the planning legislation. There is some logic in exempting from the normal planning application process development carried out by a local authority and having a separate procedure for that. Whether the Part X procedure is adequate is another debate. I accept there is logic in the argument that it is nonsensical for a local authority to apply to itself for planning permission. However, the same argument cannot apply to the kind of developments that are likely to arise under public private partnerships which will now be exempt development under paragraph (<i>f</i>). The Minister has tabled an amendment dealing with that paragraph but I do not see how it differs substantially from the existing draft. He should explain how amendment No. 19 alters, in essence, what is proposed in paragraph (<i>f</i>).</P>
      <P>This is an issue on which I have strong views and is one on which we must make a decision unless the Minister can satisfy me that his amendment is sufficient to meet the argument I made on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion outlines the Labour Party's response to the housing crisis and we are seeking the support of Dáil Éireann for the comprehensive package of measures we are proposing.</P>
      <P>The housing crisis is damaging individuals, families, communities and the economy. A few weeks ago, during Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, admitted that a couple with a combined income of £40,000 could not afford to buy a home from their own resources and would have to qualify for the new affordable housing schemes. In other words, two young teachers, professionals or public servants can no longer afford to buy on two salaries the same house their parents could have bought on one income 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>We all know of the financial price of housing but there is also a significant personal, family and economic cost. To obtain the money to buy a house, people are over borrowing and exposing themselves to financial risk, particularly if interest rates continue to increase or house prices collapse. To buy a house at a price they can afford, many couples are now buying homes a considerable distance from their place of work and from their families and friends, thus adding to commuting time, congestion on the roads and the disintegration of communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To pay the mortgage, it is necessary for both partners to work long hours with obvious con<Col N="70" /> sequences for family life, child care and relationships. Those who cannot afford to buy are forced to rent, often at monthly rents higher than mortgage repayments for a similar property. This increased demand for rental accommodation is, in turn, squeezing out those who traditionally rented on a short-term basis, mainly students and young single workers. All these factors are adding to the increasing numbers on waiting lists for local authority and social housing. At the sharp end of the crisis, evictions are increasing and homelessness is growing.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, there were more than 50,000 applicants on council waiting lists for various forms of public and social housing. If one assumes the average family comprises three people, that is 150,000 people. To this figure one can add those who do not qualify for local authority or social housing, those who cannot afford to buy a house and those in need of short-term accommodation, such as students and young workers. It is no exaggeration to state that 250,000 people are directly affected by the housing crisis. Many more people are indirectly affected by the crisis such as families of those on council waiting lists who have to cope with stressful and over-crowded conditions, as three generations are often crammed into a small family dwelling. Those indirectly affected also include retired workers who put up pension or redundancy lump sums to provide down payments for their sons or daughters who are seeking to buy a house.</P>
    <P>The economy is also affected. For the past two years or more, international bodies such as the OECD, the European Commission and the European Central Bank have expressed concern about rising house price inflation in Ireland, warnings also expressed by the ESRI, IBEC and the ICTU. The housing crisis is the largest threat to the continued health of the economy. Mortgages are not included in the consumer price index, but rising house prices have helped to re-kindle inflation, now at its highest level for 15 years.</P>
    <P>The labour shortage is exacerbated by the housing crisis. The former chairman of FÁS, given the task of encouraging Irish emigrants to return, recently cited the high cost of housing as the greatest disincentive. Individual employers and IBEC have also drawn attention to high housing costs as an obstacle to investment and labour mobility. In Dublin, there are reports of hospitals unable to recruit nurses, schools unable to recruit teachers and, in the past week, one bank offered a special pay increase to Dublin-based employees to help offset the spiralling cost of housing. In addition, the trade union movement has warned that the partnership agreement is at risk because of the Government's failure to address the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the crisis in housing are complex and interlinked. It would be unfair to blame the Government for starting the increase in house prices, but it is to blame for allowing the problem to develop to crisis proportions. Three years ago, just before the Government took office, the aver<Col N="71" /> age price of a new house was £73,523. The most recent figures published by the Department show the average price of a new house is now £124,545 &ndash; an increase of 70%. Before this Government took office the average price of a new house in Dublin was £84,001, that figure has almost doubled to £163,797.</P>
    <P>These are the official figures published by the Department which show that while this Government has been in office, average house prices have risen by £20,000 per year throughout the country, and by almost £30,000 per year in Dublin. When this Government took office, it was possible to rent a family sized house or apartment in Dublin for about £400 per month. The same letting now costs almost double that sum at £750 or £800 per month.</P>
    <P>Before this Government took office there were 26,000 applicants seeking local authority housing. By March 1999, the latest date for which figures are available, that number had risen to 40,000 and the total number on all council waiting lists for all forms of social housing was 50,000. That assessment is 15 months out of date and the total number on housing lists is probably closer to 60,000.</P>
    <P>The report of the cross-departmental team on homelessness published last month noted the number of homeless people increased during our period of greatest wealth, from 2,501 in 1996 to 5,234 in 1999. Almost 1,000 of these are children living in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, as highlighted in the report of the homeless initiative published last autumn.</P>
    <P>This Government has been a complete failure on housing. Three years ago, it grandiosely proclaimed in its first programme for Government that, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to the deeply held ideal of so many Irish people &ndash; home ownership&rdquo;. However, this Government has made home ownership an impossible dream for many.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government to put home ownership beyond the reach of young middle income working couples. Its response to the housing crisis has been characterised by denial, delay and deficiency. At first it refused to recognise there was any crisis. Shortly after the formation of this Government, professionals in housing, particularly those involved in social and voluntary housing, began to demand the establishment of a housing commission to examine the housing problem in its totality. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who are absent from this debate so far, pointedly refused to establish a housing commission and insisted this was a market problem which could be resolved by increasing supply and rebalancing the market. Almost every belated attempt by this Government to address the housing crisis has been a failure.</P>
    <P>Deputies Molloy and Dempsey claimed that increasing housing supply would restore balance <Col N="72" /> to the market. Last year housing output increased to a record 46,000, of which only 3,500 was for social housing, and a large proportion of the new houses built last year were purchased by investors. The number of first time buyer's grants issued by the Department actually fell. The Government is at last recognising what the Labour Party has been arguing for the past two years &ndash; that increasing housing supply is not enough and that intervention in the market is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government also gave credence to the notion promoted by developers that local authorities had not zoned sufficient land for residential development. The Department's national survey of building land published last week clearly shows that sufficient land is zoned to satisfy building requirements for the next four years at least, and that the real problem with building land is caused by speculation and hoarding.</P>
    <P>The two Bacon reports published in 1998 and 1999 were supposed to calm the housing market and reduce investor activity. However, they achieved neither. The conclusions being reached in the third Bacon report are proof that the first two failed to resolve the problem. The new house price index rose from 176 when the first Bacon report was published in spring 1998 to 236 at the end of 1999, an increase of 60 points, hardly evidence of price calming.</P>
    <P>The various incentives introduced by Government to assist the building industry have been pocketed by builders and developers and not passed on to the house purchasers. The serviced land incentive, in effect, is a State subsidy to builders and developers who are already making high profits. The reduction in capital gains tax from 40% to 20% was supposed to encourage the release of building land, yet even now the Government admits this has not worked and that building land is being hoarded. Despite the incentives provided by Government, all the evidence is that builders, developers and land speculators are making an enormous killing at the expense of house buyers.</P>
    <P>The indices published in the Housing Statistics Bulletin of the Department of the Environment and Local Government are revealing on this point. They show that back over the years, the new house price index remained consistently in line with the consumer price index, the average earnings index and the house building cost index. In 1995, the house price index was 116, average earnings 116, the CPI 111 and cost of building 114. By the end of 1999, the house price index had shot up to 236 whereas the CPI had only increased to 121 and the cost of building index to 134. In other words, the cost of building a house, that is the cost of labour and materials, had increased by 20 points since 1995, but the price of the house had increased by 120 points. The 100 point difference is the excess profit that has been made by a combination of land owners, builders and building professionals directly at the expense of the house buyer.</P>
    <P>Those official figures show the irrefutable evi<Col N="73" /> dence of profiteering in the housing market. We all know that house prices have increased over the past five years, but these figures show that house prices have gone up not because it is more expensive to build houses but because sections of the construction and development industry have been plundering the house buyer for excess profit.</P>
    <P>The housing crisis is no longer capable of being solved by modest reforms such as changes in stamp duty or capital gains tax. Comprehensive and radical measures are needed to get to grips with the depth of the housing crisis. In this motion tonight, the Labour Party puts forward such a package. It is based on the excellent study of the housing crisis undertaken by Professor P. J. Drudy of Trinity College who chaired the Labour Party housing commission which reported in May last year. Unlike the failed Bacon reports, Professor Drudy's analysis has endured and the innovative recommendations contained in the report of the housing commission, some of which were dismissed by the Minister at the time, are coming to be accepted as necessary and urgent.</P>
    <P>There are ten essential elements to the housing strategy proposed by the Labour Party. Our first proposal relates to State intervention in building land. It is generally accepted that the price and availability of building land is one of the major factors contributing to high house prices. In their submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, the CIF and the Irish House Builders Association stated that the cost of land accounts for approximately 50% of the price of new houses. The ICTU told the committee of its evidence that building land in Dublin is being hoarded by a small handful of developers who control 80% of the zoned land in the capital. Some builders are experiencing great difficulty in acquiring sites at a reasonable cost because of the land hoarding by large developers. The windfall profits being made from land rezoning have contributed to speculation in agricultural land in and around towns and cities and that, in turn, has contributed to the corruption of the planning process, which is the subject of the Flood tribunal.</P>
    <P>Measures to end land speculation and to release building land for the construction of urgently needed houses are long overdue. The Labour Party proposes that the Government should direct each local authority to assemble a land bank capable of supplying the sites necessary to meet housing need for the foreseeable future. Local authorities already have the power to buy land for development purposes and to acquire land by compulsory purchase, where necessary. In addition, we propose that local authorities should be given the power and resources to compulsorily purchase undeveloped zoned land that is being hoarded and to have first option on the acquisition of newly zoned residential land. Such land banks would be managed by the local authority and the land released not only for the authority's housing programme but also for the <Col N="74" /> private house building sector, affordable housing schemes and housing to be provided by the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>There are several advantages to bringing building land under the management of local authorities. Through the local authority services such as roads, water and sewerage are provided to these lands. The local authority is responsible for the planning of development and ultimately taking public charge of housing estates when built and often for the provision of community, leisure and recreational facilities. By putting the local authority in charge of the land resources, we provide for better planning and for the development of communities and community facilities at an early stage of development.</P>
    <P>In the context of house prices, this measure would undermine land speculation and puncture the land profiteering which is adding so much to the cost of housing. Considering the huge amount of housing development that must be undertaken over the next decade, approximately 500,000 new houses, it makes sense in the interest of making houses affordable and of good planning to manage the land resource by the same public authorities that are responsible for servicing, planning and ultimately taking public charge of the development.</P>
    <P>To resource this initiative, the Labour Party proposes to use part of the surplus that has been generated by the sale of State assets. The Government intends to use these funds to establish a public service pension fund. The Labour Party believes those funds should be invested in Ireland and that investing in residential land would serve two purposes. It would help resolve the housing crisis while investing at home in a secure asset on which a sufficient return could be obtained to underpin public service pensions.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's second proposal relates to the establishment of a national housing authority. This State is facing a decade of house building unprecedented in our history. It is estimated that 500,000 new dwellings will be needed over the next ten years. That means that one in every three housing units needed by 2012 will have to be built over the next decade. To drive and co-ordinate the provision of housing on this scale, the Labour Party proposes the establishment of a national housing authority. The existing National Building Agency and Housing Finance Agency could be consolidated into a new NHA. Such an authority would be responsible for the allocation of funding for local authority land banks, overseeing local authority house building programmes, the acquisition of building land, where necessary, the provision of professional, technical and managerial support to the voluntary housing sector, supplementing the house building efforts of local authorities, where necessary, and administering quality standards and fair price certification.</P>
    <P>At critical stages in the development of this country it has been necessary to establish national <Col N="75" /> agencies to drive and co-ordinate the process. We needed the IDA for industrialisation, the ESB for electrification, FÁS for industrial training and, more recently, the National Roads Authority for road development. Our national housing need is now so great that provision can no longer be left to the traditional sources of private house building and local authorities. A co-ordinated national effort is required, hence the need for a national housing authority.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's third proposal relates to the control of new house prices. I referred earlier to the extent to which the price of new houses has shot ahead of the cost of building them. The extent of excess profiteering in the housing market is a justification for putting some control on new house prices. Such control will be needed, in any event, if the measures on building land proposed by the Labour Party are to be adopted. Controls on price will also be needed when the 20% affordable housing provisions in the new planning Bill eventually take effect. Controlling new house prices is not a new concept. In the 1980s an attempt was made to control new house prices through certificates of reasonable value. The Labour Party housing commission has proposed a more refined and more effective means of controlling new house prices through a system of fair price certification which would be based on the cost of house building, the new arrangements which we are proposing for the control and provision of building land and sustainable margins for the building industry.</P>
    <P>Our fourth proposal relates to the regulation of the housing market. Not all of the profiteering in the housing market is attributed to land speculation. There has been well reported evidence of price gazumping by builders. Last year a Bill on that subject introduced by Deputy Hayes was debated in this House. The standard and quality of some new houses is poor. Workmanship, finishes and the quality of materials are sometimes substandard. While the house buyer has redress to the home bond scheme for major defects in a house, there is little a purchaser can do to resolve matters such as uncompleted snags or poor quality materials.</P>
    <P>There is no licensing or regulation of our building industry. Any person without the necessary qualifications or experience can set himself up as a builder.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a need for regulation of the building industry. Similarly, the practices of some auctioneers, advertisers and lawyers in the housing market have been less than commendable and have added hype to that sector and contributed through that hype and high fees to the increased prices being paid by the purchaser.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes legislation is needed to regulate the operation of the housing market, including the registration of builders, the activities of professionals and agents in the market; the control of standards and the protection of the housebuyers' consumer rights. We are proposing <Col N="76" /> the establishment of a regulator to oversee all aspects of the operation of the housing market.</P>
    <P>Our fifth proposal relates to local authority and social housing. In March 1999 there were more than 50,000 applicants on council waiting lists for local authority housing and for the various other forms of social housing. Despite the fact that overall house construction has doubled in the past five or six years, the number of local authority and voluntary sector houses being built has remained static. In 1999 there were fewer local authority and voluntary sector houses completed than in 1995. The figures for 1995 are 2,960 local authority houses and 1,011 voluntary sector houses, a total of 3,971, while the figures for 1999 are 2,909 local authority houses and 579 voluntary sector houses, a total of 3,488.</P>
    <P>The prospects for 2000 are not much brighter. At the recent meeting of the environment committee which considered the Department's annual Estimate, the Minister admitted the total number of completions for this year would be about 4,000, a far cry from the 5,500 promised in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and in the national plan, and an even further cry from the number required. More applicants are being added to the housing list every year than the number of houses being provided. There will have to be a massive increase in the public and social housing programme. The Labour Party has proposed a front loaded programme for the construction of 50,000 local authority and social housing units. This programme should be reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted to meet anticipated need.</P>
    <P>Voluntary housing accounts for only about 1% of house tenure in Ireland. This is the lowest in Europe. Clearly there is huge scope for the voluntary sector, including building co-operatives, trade unions and others, to become directly involved in housing provision. The Minister has set an ambitious target of 4,000 voluntary sector housing units per annum. Only slightly more than 500 per year are being built. To increase the output of the voluntary sector, it is necessary to provide a much wider range of supports for the voluntary housing sector. We propose that this be done through the National Housing Authority.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons there is a necessity to reform local housing administration. First, there is considerable overlap and duplication between the local authorities and the health boards. The local authorities maintain the housing lists and allocate houses but the health board is responsible for emergency accommodation for homeless people. The local authorities are responsible for the registration of private rented accommodation but the health boards administer the rent allowance scheme. All this administration should be rationalised and brought under one roof. Second, local authorities have in recent times been unable to meet the relatively modest housing targets set for them. In some cases this is due to land shortage, but in others it points to a need to strengthen the skills and resources in local authority housing <Col N="77" /> departments. There is a need to develop a housing services profession within the local government system and to provide appropriate training for local authority staff who are working on new and difficult areas of housing administration, such as estate management.</P>
    <P>We have particular proposals in the private rented sector. In April, RTE broadcast a hard-hitting documentary on the private rented sector. It highlighted a number of things. It showed that landlords were taking rent from tenants in accommodation which had been condemned and it highlighted a string of examples where accommodation was unsafe with serious structural problems, appalling wiring and dampness.</P>
    <P>The private rented sector is in tatters. We are the only country in Europe which has no effective legislation to govern the relationship between landlords and tenants. Lack of affordable private housing and the enormous shortage of public housing has forced more people into private rented accommodation and, as an off-shoot from the demand in this sector, standards have dropped and prices have soared. Some 12 months ago it was clear that new legislation was needed to deal with standards and security of tenure in the private rented sector. True to its record on housing, the Government turned into jelly and avoided the issue by establishing a commission to identify the problems in the sector. We have yet to see the recommendations of this commission.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is calling for the introduction of legislation to protect tenants in the private rented sector. We are seeking security of tenure for tenants. Figures from the housing agency, Threshold, which show that illegal evictions doubled last month, are indicative of the urgency attached to our demand. In this motion we seek also rent certainty. Today's consumer price index shows the single biggest factor in rising inflation was housing costs, and much of this can be attributed to rising rental costs. Rents should reflect people's ability to pay and not the value of property.</P>
    <P>As an additional safeguard in the private rented sector, we propose the establishment of a housing court which would operate along similar lines to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to determine issues relating to security of tenure, rent certainty and other disputes between landlords and tenants. Students and transient works have specific accommodation needs. To date, the State has failed to develop any ground rules which would ensure their access to short-term housing within the vicinity of their workplace. Most European countries have developed provisions which ensure students are not forced to spend the first three months of each academic year in search of housing which is either unaffordable or in appalling condition. We propose the building of purpose built accommodation on campus, where possible. During off-peak periods, this accommodation could be used to facilitate conferences and exchange students.</P>
    <P>In this motion, we are also putting an onus on <Col N="78" /> commercial and industrial developments to contain a residential component to cater for transient and short-term workers. The administration of rent allowance and other housing benefits is out-dated. The changing needs of the labour force and the increasing dependency on private rented accommodation among low paid workers makes it imperative that the schemes be radically altered in the way in which they are administered.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party proposes a new housing benefit which would be neutral as to the tenure of housing and the labour market status of the applicant. As it stands, a low income family on family income supplement who live in private rented accommodation cannot access any rent subsidy, while a family in similar circumstances in local authority accommodation will qualify for differential rent. Such anomalies need to be addressed in a meaningful way through the introduction of a single benefit.</P>
    <P>The report of the Labour Party housing commission last year set down four basic principles to underpin housing policy. First, housing is a social good. Since housing represents one of the fundamental requirements of human beings, it should not be treated in the same way as non-essential traded commodities for speculation or investment. Second, every person should have a right to good quality affordable housing appropriate to their particular needs. This right should be enshrined in the Constitution or in legislation. Third, in view of the particular significance of housing for society, market forces alone must not be allowed to dictate its provision and price. In accordance with the Constitution, strong intervention by the State may be essential in the interests of social justice and the common good. Fourth, land is one of the critical resources required for housing. For this reason, actions of the State on behalf of the community to re-zoning, planning permission or the provision of infrastructure should not result in significant untaxed gains to landowners.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, these are not the principles which inspire this Government's housing policy. For this Government, a house is a commodity. To the Progressive Democrats, housing is a market and they are ideologically hung up about State intervention in that market. For Fianna Fáil, the house building industry is its commercial wing and it too has been reluctant, for obvious reasons, to intervene in the interests of the house buyer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing crisis in Dublin is at <Col N="79" /> an all time high. Demand for local government housing has never been greater and private housing has never been more expensive. It is impossible for a young person on an average salary to contemplate the purchase of his or her own home. The luxury of ownership of their own property is totally outside the realm of most young people on an average wage. Although, as a country, more houses are being built than ever before, only 7.5% of these are for social housing even though the ESRI estimates that the proportion needs to be raised to 35% to meet current housing needs.</P>
      <P>The price of new and second-hand houses in Dublin increased by almost £30,000 last year. This level of increase is impossible for the average home buyer. Speculators are now one of the major causes of the house shortage. Houses were purchased by speculators for purposes of investment and letting, thus depriving first-time buyers of the opportunity to purchase their own homes at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>The rate of homelessness has doubled in the past three years. This is another aspect of the housing crisis that has been forgotten by those who reaped the rewards of many of the planning scams of the 1970s, 1980s and the early 1990s. The number of hostel places for homeless women, for example, is nowhere near adequate. At present the number of homeless women in Dublin is estimated at more than 1,000, but hostel places are available for less than 500.</P>
      <P>The Government has presided over an unprecedented increase in the number of homeless people in our capital city. At a time of unequalled wealth it is unforgivable that so many people should have to face such a situation day after day and night after night on our streets. The resources to deal with homelessness are available but the political will to use them is absent. The causes of homelessness are complex and often related to factors other than material needs, but the problem of homelessness on our streets is a national scandal. It is a problem that could be reduced significantly if only the political will existed to address it comprehensively.</P>
      <P>There is a need to review the system of allocating local authority flats or houses. People find it difficult to understand why some are allocated flats or houses while others drop further and further down the waiting list. For the latter group, it is like looking for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow &ndash; it never arrives. One of my constituents has been 14 years on a housing transfer list. Each time he thinks he is almost there, the points increase again and once more a house is beyond his reach.</P>
      <P>An ombudsman to deal with housing complaints or concerns, such as the one I have just described, would be one way of addressing the problem. An appeals mechanism would remove all doubt or question from the minds of those on the list. All allocations and the reasons for such allocations should be publicly available.</P>

      <Col N="80" /> Tenants in private rented accommodation are paying huge rents and have few, if any, legal rights. Unlike most other European countries, Ireland offers little protection to tenants. Generally, tenants can have their rents increased by the landlords at will and can be evicted for no reason, with just one month's notice. Inordinate rent increases at the whim of a landlord provide an effective way of ensuring tenants will leave their accommodation.</P>
    <P>Just two weeks ago, one of my constituents had her monthly rent increased by £200. In such a case there is no need for a landlord to consider an eviction notice because the unfortunate tenant has no choice but to move on. As always, it is the vulnerable who are exploited in this way. They have little redress, are unable to afford the rent and are forced to find accommodation of poor quality. Alternatively, they will find themselves homeless. Tenants in private rented accommodation have to be protected. Above all, there must be a fair and equitable system of appeal that will ensure tenants are not victimised by an unscrupulous landlords.</P>
    <P>Many tenants live in unbelievable conditions because they cannot afford to complain for fear or being evicted or having the rent increased beyond their reach. All private rented accommodation should meet minimum standards of comfort and safety. Landlords should be required to be registered and subject to a quality control system as applies in the provision of many other services and facilities. Those who do not reach the required standards should not be allowed to let their properties and should be subject to stiff penalties if found in breach of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Standards of new homes should be assured through quality assurance schemes as in other production processes. Shoddy work, unfinished building sites and poor quality materials should be eliminated. People are not only paying a great deal for their houses &ndash; that is, those who can afford to buy a house &ndash;  but new houses are frequently poorly finished and the quality of materials used is also poor. The surrounding areas are often neglected by the builder as he moves on to commence another new job, leaving behind unsightly debris, including rubble.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, people buy their houses from plans without even seeing a show home and once they have paid their deposits, little redress is available to them. It is beyond the means of a young couple to engage in long and expensive legal battles. Instead, they opt to endure the poor workmanship and shoddy materials simply because they cannot afford an alternative.</P>
    <P>A landbank is available in Abbotstown, which it is proposed to use as a sports stadium. Since nobody appears to need this white elephant, it would be much more appropriate to dedicate the site to housing.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time. I support the motion and I note that many of the measures contained <Col N="81" /> in it reflect proposals put forward by my party in our general and local election manifestos, as well as in successive pre-budget submissions I have prepared since 1997.</P>
      <P>We have been in the depths of a housing crisis since the Government took office and that crisis has worsened since the general election almost three years ago. At a time when there are daily revelations about the funding of the two major parties by speculators and developers, more than 50,000 people are languishing on housing waiting lists. These waiting lists were created by the inaction of the same parties in successive Governments and by the gross profiteering of their friends and fundraisers. This is a national scandal.</P>
      <P>The 1999 assessment of local authority housing needs showed more than 700 people on the waiting list in County Cavan and more than 600 in County Monaghan. People in desperate housing need contact me, and my party colleagues, daily. For these people this is a crisis. Their right to housing is fundamental and it is primarily the responsibility of the State to direct provision by the local authorities to ensure these people are housed.</P>
      <P>There must be action by the Government to curb speculation. In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin argued for an increase in capital gains tax on speculative owners of multiple dwellings. Such a tax could be introduced on a phased basis over a period of two years &ndash; at 40% in April 2001 and 60% in April 2002. We also called for the abolition of stamp duty for all houses whose purchase price is less than £150,000.</P>
      <P>We have yet to see the measures we are told were approved by the Cabinet today, but it is reported that the Government &ndash; very belatedly, I may add &ndash; is coming some way towards these proposals. I hope it is, but much more needs to be done and much more should have been done before now. Whatever measures are announced this week, they cannot hope to make up for the three years of failure and neglect of the housing crisis by the Government. When the next general election comes and the record of the Government is examined, this will prove to have been the single biggest failure. That will be crystal clear to the electorate.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support the motion in the name of Deputy Gilmore. We have a massive housing crisis not as a result of any accident, but because the Government is in the pockets of speculators, big builders and developers. It puts the interests of that small cabal before those of ordinary working people and the poor. We have a crisis in the private rented accommodation sector because the Government is in the pockets of landlords. It allows free reign to rack rent at a rate that would make even the landlords' 19th century predecessors blush with shame, such is the level of exploitation and profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revolting saga of corruption and payola <Col N="82" /> that has been revealed in all its lack of glory in recent months, featuring politicians and political parties in the pay of developers and big builders, leaves ordinary people with a heavy price to pay. Politicians and political parties in the pocket of this cabal have allowed it to profiteer outrageously at the expense of ordinary people. There should now be an immediate imposition of an 80% tax on windfall profits that have been accrued as a result of profiteering by this cabal in the housing industry in the past few years. Speculation must be rooted out.</P>
    <P> The price of building land has to be strictly controlled through a landbank &ndash; as envisaged in the motion &ndash; which would be purchased by local authorities at agricultural prices. We desperately need controls in the private rented sector, including security of tenure and controlled rents. Purpose-built accommodation for students would free up thousands of places in the private rented sector and, in turn, would assist in providing necessary accommodation. We need massive investment in local authority housing. The horrific suffering of people in need of homes due to overcrowding, tension and stress, which I as a public representative witness on a weekly basis, must be dealt with. We need emergency investment to meet this need. We must put people before profit and provide a proper housing policy.</P>

    <P>&ndash;and supports the continued commitment by the Government to expand the supply of housing across all tenures and to improve access by all income groups to suitable housing accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the crucially important subject of housing and to outline yet again the main features of the Government's approach to housing and the degree to which the Government's measures are yielding positive results in a period of extraordinary and unprecedented growth in housing demand.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's motion for discussion here this evening is nothing more than a hopeless attempt to dredge up the hulk of their so-called commission on housing, the report of which was launched by that party for the local elections and promptly and unsurprisingly sank without trace. That they would seek to do this is understandable given the party's poverty of ideas and mix of ideologies but I am genuinely disappointed that the Labour Party still seems unable to grasp even the most basic issues involved.</P>
    <P>Its motion is testament to the strong philosophy of control and regulation alive and well in the new Labour Party. The headings alone betray its outdated and discredited philosophy &ndash; state intervention, price control, regulation of the market. Of course, no piece of good old-fashioned socialist rhetoric would be complete without a call for the establishment of a quango or two. Its lack of understanding of the real world is illustrated clearly by the absence in its motion of any mention of the need to address supply and capacity bottlenecks or the need for a strategic approach to development planning.</P>
    <P>In December 1994, Labour Party Ministers took up office in two Departments of key influence in relation to housing &ndash; the Departments of the Environment and Finance. Why, during <Col N="87" /> their two and a half years in Government, did they not take action to address the problems that were clearly developing in the housing area? The motion refers to 70% price increases since this Government took office. What it neglects to state is that almost half of that increase took place in this Government's first year, directly as a result of the previous Government's neglect of the crucially important issue of housing.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not entirely correct to say nothing was done. The trouble is that what was done made matters worse &ndash; like the hefty hike in stamp duty on middle of the range houses imposed in the 1997 budget. The result was that the cost of moving house became prohibitive. There was a major blockage in the second-hand market with the knock-on effect that houses were not being released to first time purchasers.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Government took office we commissioned a detailed study of the house prices issue. Even before the study was completed we acted decisively to address the critical housing supply situation with the launch of a serviced land initiative in November 1997. If the previous Government had the foresight or concern to take such an initiative, we would now be reaping the benefit of a large increase both in housing supply and in availability of serviced land.</P>
    <P>This Government's priorities have focused on the introduction of a range of measures which aim to maximise and expedite housing supply, secure house price stabilisation and meet increased need for social and affordable housing. The Government has taken a range of initiatives, each building on the others and culminating in the inclusion of housing in the national development plan for the first time, which together provide a comprehensive and coherent response to the major housing issues.</P>
    <P>This Government's publication of Action on House Prices in April 1998 was the first of two major policy initiatives aimed at achieving moderation in house price increases and relieving the pressures in the housing market. The primary focus of Action on House Prices was on a range of measures to increase supply. These included doubling the funding, from £15 million to £30 million, for the serviced land initiative and subsequently increasing this to £39 million later in 1998. Some £5 million was provided for specific non-national road schemes opening up land for housing development. Tax measures were also implemented with the aim of bringing residential land quickly into development and to prevent investors pricing first time buyers out of the market.</P>
    <P>A number of positive developments took place last year, supported by a continuation of the measures in Action on House Prices and additional measures introduced in Action on the Housing Market which took account of the recommendations in the second Bacon report completed last March. These developments included the publication of guidelines on residen<Col N="88" /> tial density, strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, the introduction of an affordable housing scheme, improvements to a number of social housing schemes and, of course, drawing up the national development plan.</P>
    <P>We are ensuring housing supply continues to be maximised. My Department issued the residential density guidelines to all planning authorities in September 1999, to which they, and An Bord Pleanála, are statutorily required to have regard. Indications are that local authorities and An Bord Pleanála have already taken on board the principles set out in the guidelines. Since their publication An Bord Pleanála has granted appeals for high density development on the Blanchardstown Hospital site, which will yield 1,500 housing units, and a second site in Santry, Demesne, which will yield 1,100 housing units.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made under the serviced land initiative and output under the initiative is expected to exceed the 100,000 units originally envisaged. By the end of this year schemes providing 100,000 sites nationally will either be completed or in construction. Key infrastructure projects such as the Swords treatment works and the north fringe sewer, both of which are critical to the development of the north Dublin area, are progressing well. Tenders for the Swords scheme, which has the capacity to support the development of 8,000 additional housing units, were approved at the end of last year. The north fringe sewer will be completed by mid-2002 rather than 2004, which was originally projected when the second Bacon report was produced. Additional staff have been recruited by An Bord Pleanála and local authorities to accelerate the planning process.</P>
    <P>The national development plan published in November last provides for massively increased investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and public transport, which is essential to support housing development in the period to 2006 and beyond. Never before has State investment in water, sewerage, roads and other services required to open up building land for development been increased so substantially as it has been by the Government since we took office. To give one example, funding for water and sewerage services has increased from £163 million in 1997 to almost £290 million this year, an increase of 78%.</P>
    <P>This increased investment is clearly yielding dividends. My Department published details last week of the first national inventory of zoned serviced land which shows that, based on local authority returns, the position in relation to the stock of serviced building land is both encouraging and is set to improve significantly, going forward on foot of further major investment in these services over the period of the national development plan. In Dublin, for example, the supply of zoned and serviced land exceeds 1,000 hectares which is sufficient land for more than 40,000 housing units or four times last year's record output in the Dublin area. House completions in 1999 reached a record <Col N="89" /> 46,512 units nationally, up 9.8% on 1998, which was, in turn, up 9% on 1997. Output in Dublin topped 10,000 units last year, a 12% increase on 1998, while completions in the greater Dublin area totalled 15,228 units, up 7% on 1998.</P>
    <P>These measures, taken by this Government, achieved a private housing output of 43,000 units in 1999. This was the level of output projected in the first Bacon report in 1998 that would be required to achieve stability in the housing market. We have achieved the targets we set, which many economists thought were too ambitious. However, extremely strong economic growth, employment growth and immigration means that we must redouble our efforts. The indications are that the upward trend in new house completions is set to continue. HomeBond registrations, a leading indicator of future housing development, rose by 16.5% nationally in 1999, and registrations are up 21.4% nationally in the first five months of 2000, compared to the same period in 1999 and by 38.7% in Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>In spite of continuing high demand, the effects of increased output are reflected in moderating house price trends since house price inflation peaked in 1998. Prices for the first quarter of 2000 in Dublin are showing reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand homes, respectively &ndash; the first time that average house prices have dropped since 1995.</P>
    <P>Year-on-year new and second-hand house prices rose by 13% and 14% nationally, the lowest increases since 1996. This we have been able to achieve despite the lack of foresight and financial planning on the part of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Labour Party's knee-jerk response is to introduce price control in a classic case of the economics of illusion. Otherwise it would hardly insult the intelligence of the people with the discredited concept of new house price control. What happens when the new house becomes a second-hand house? This Government is acting to curb speculation in housing. Artificial controls on new houses would facilitate this. Who will issue these &ldquo;fair price&rdquo; certificates or on what basis? A similar approach was tried in the past and proved ineffective and in many ways counter-productive. It would not cause a single extra house to be built. It could retard housing supply if, as inevitably would be the case, it gave rise to an elaborate bureaucratic process. Few, if any, credible commentators seriously suggest that artificial price control offers a sensible approach to addressing the real issues currently affecting the housing market.</P>
    <P>The Government is addressing where our growing population will live and how people will get from their homes to work, school and other amenities which are central to our quality of life. We are preparing a national spatial development strategy which will identify broad spatial development patterns for areas and set down indicative policies on the location of industrial, residential <Col N="90" /> and rural development. The strategy will attempt to deliver more balanced development between and within regions. Strategic planning guidelines have been launched by the Government which will form the basis of a development strategy for the overall Dublin and mid-east area. This strategy in the regional guidelines will be implemented at sub-regional level by local authorities through their development plans.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's proposals make no reference to one of the most fundamental changes to Irish planning law which is contained in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, currently at Report Stage. Part V of the Bill requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies addressing the housing needs in the area covered by their development plans, including the need for social and affordable housing. The Bill requires them to zone sufficient land to meet these needs. Up to 20% of land zoned for residential development may be set aside to meet the assessed social and affordable housing need. The Bill permits local authorities to secure this land at existing use value from developers. This provision will secure significant tracts of residential development land for local authorities on completion of their housing strategies.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Part V recognise that the value of land is increased manifold by a local authority decision to zone land. No person is entitled to have his or her land zoned and it is perfectly reasonable that the greater community, through the local authority, should be able to reap for the public good an appropriate proportion of the gain it confers on the landowner. The landowner will be able to get full development value for the remaining 80% of the land involved and will not suffer any loss on the land transferred to the local authority. This approach will make land available to local authorities at low cost, while not interfering unfairly or in an arbitrary manner with the property rights of the landowner. Local authorities have been asked to press ahead with working up their housing strategies so that they can be in place at the earliest possible date following commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The acid test that must be applied to the Labour Party proposals in this area is whether they will bring land into development more quickly or at a cheaper cost than can be achieved at present. The simple fact is that they achieve neither of these. Contrary to how the Labour Party would portray its proposals, there is no quick-fix, bargain basement solution to moderating house prices through wholesale acquisition of land. This Labour Party motion implies that we should send out housing officers with cheque books to compete for land and further drive up prices. This is another example of the lack of rigorous analysis underlying this motion.</P>
    <P>At a time when our objective is to accelerate and increase the supply of housing, the Labour Party seeks to impose another layer of bureaucracy in the form of a national housing authority, <Col N="91" /> which, of course, would have the opposite effect and cause a hiatus in the supply response. Does the Labour Party propose we should set aside the local authority system and that the national housing authority should usurp its role? The local authority response over the last few years has been commendable under very difficult circumstances. I wonder how enthusiastic Labour Party councillors throughout the country would be about losing housing functions to a national housing authority, or about the slur implied in the reference to &ldquo;local housing authorities who are unable to achieve their housing targets&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government will seek to strengthen and resource the structures that are already in place in the Department and in local authorities to secure the necessary supply of housing and seek to expand the capacity of the construction industry to achieve a further increment in the supply response.</P>
    <P>With regard to the private rented residential sector, the Government established a commission last July to examine and make recommendations on a wide range of issues relating to the sector, including improved security of tenure, maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the respective rights and obligations of landlords and tenants and increasing investment in, and the supply of, accommodation in the sector. The membership of the commission includes representatives of landlords, tenants, the legal profession and property investment interests, together with relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>The commission was asked to report by 1 June 2000. However, the chairman, on behalf of the commission, asked to extend the deadline by one month and the request was acceded to. In making the request, the chairman indicated that a considerable effort had been expended on trying to reach consensus on the key areas of security of tenure, dispute resolution mechanisms and rent reviews, and that the additional time would facilitate the commission in seeking to achieve as much consensus as possible. The Government is now expecting the report of the commission at the end of June or early July and intends to arrange for its publication after we receive it. In conjunction with its publication, the action the Government proposes to take on foot of the recommendations contained in the report will be announced.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to pre-empt the contents of the report, I anticipate that recommendations will relate to changes required to the legislative and regulatory frameworks, with a view to achieving better enforcement of an agreed framework and to removing certain legal difficulties that currently exist; improved dispute resolution mechanisms, including the possible establishment of a new body with mediation and arbitration functions; measures to improve security of tenure, to provide greater awareness of mutual rights and obligations and to amend notice to quit periods to reflect length of tenancies; and measures to <Col N="92" /> promote the development of the sector and, in particular, to facilitate increased supply of accommodation with a view to meeting longer term housing needs.</P>
    <P>I expect the commission will identify areas where changes can be made, leading to a rented sector which provides an excellent service to tenants and an appropriate return to landlords. The objective is to enable the sector develop to its maximum potential so it may be seen as a tenure of choice, along with social housing or home ownership.</P>
    <P>In the past two years the Government has taken measures to boost supply of private rented accommodation and to provide additional support for people in private rented residential accommodation. Substantial increases in tax relief for tenants took effect from the current tax year. The protection afforded to tenants under the registration of rented houses regulations has also been improved. In January last, the regulations were amended to provide that the onus is now on the landlord to prove that a dwelling is exempt from the requirements of the regulations and to remove the exemption from the regulations on the grounds that the letting is of a &ldquo;temporary convenience&rdquo; nature.</P>
    <P>Targeted incentives for the provision of student accommodation were introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. I am pleased to say that some 1,100 places should be available by October of this year and more than 7,500 places are at various stages of planning. It seems the Labour Party has missed the boat on this one.</P>
    <P>Instead, the motion calls for rent control. Rent control proved disastrous for the private rented sector in this country, as it did in any other country in which it was imposed. EU countries are now trying to get rid of any vestiges of rent control that have sent their private rented sectors into decline. Above all, rent controls would not provide a single extra rented house or apartment. They convey an enormous advantage on persons already in rented accommodation and, of course, effectively ensure that no accommodation will be available for those seeking rented accommodation in the coming years.</P>
    <P>On the question of rent assistance for private rental accommodation, the Government has decided in principle to establish a new local authority rent assistance scheme in accordance with the main recommendations in an interdepartmental committee report published last August. This would replace, in the main, the current arrangements for rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>A planning group, under the aegis of my Department, which commenced work in April 2000, will report towards the end of this year with detailed proposals on rental assistance to enable the Government to take definitive decisions on future arrangements. It will also address a range of issues arising in the implementation of new arrangements and examine the possible scope for improvements in the existing SWA scheme, pend<Col N="93" /> ing the introduction of new arrangements. Some improvements to the existing scheme have already been introduced in this year's budget and Social Welfare Bill, particularly in relation to arrangements for retention of supplements by people making the transition from welfare to work.</P>
    <P>The key aims in the rent-assisted housing sector are to achieve greater effectiveness in meeting housing needs, maximum co-ordination of housing policy and effective arrangements to ensure needs are met. This will include retention of a welfare safety net for urgent income support needs, while avoiding, as far as possible, factors which could promote further imbalance between supply and demand in the private rental sector.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, however, that we have no intention of repeating the mistakes made in the UK where the introduction of a &ldquo;housing benefit&rdquo; system in the 1980s contributed to the creation of a high rent and chronic dependency environment. Many tenants are caught in a benefit trap &ndash; they cannot afford to leave the system and there is a major disincentive to improve their earnings.</P>
    <P>I am a little surprised that the Labour Party would wish to be associated with an approach that had its origin in Thatcherite ideology designed to undermine the position of local authorities. I am not surprised, however, that it would advocate a system that has proved something of a bureaucratic nightmare. It is well accepted that the UK housing benefit system has resulted in a high degree of complexity, cost, fraud and administrative difficulties generally. It is a system that does not appear to have served either the taxpayer or the tenant well and it has defied reform by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Introducing an expanded system of benefits or any other device that would inject more money into the market is not the answer. Indeed, it would be counterproductive in a situation where there is imbalance between supply of and demand for private rental accommodation. As is the case in the housing sector generally, it is important to focus on the supply side and this will be a key consideration for the planning group which is examining new rental assistance arrangements.</P>
    <P>The group's work is at a relatively early stage. One of the important issues which it will explore is the potential for more supply focused approaches to rental assistance, including possible arrangements and measures needed to promote improvements in standards and supply of rent assisted accommodation. The objective will not be simply to transfer what is largely a welfare payment scheme to local authorities or, as the Labour Party motion would imply, to create an expensive, bureaucratic and counterproductive system of housing benefit.</P>
    <P>This Government has for the first time provided a long-term framework for the funding of social and affordable housing through the inclusion of £6 billion in the national develop<Col N="94" /> ment plan earmarked for social and affordable housing. This allocation, which averages over £850 million per annum, reflects the commitment of the Government to tackle social and affordable housing need. The investment will ensure that the housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the plan period.</P>
    <P>The plan provides for an increase in the local authority housing programme with funding for 35,500 starts, front-loaded to meet existing demand more quickly. It also provides for the expansion of voluntary housing activity with funding for over 15,000 voluntary housing dwellings. Funding is also included for the provision by local authorities of 7,000 affordable houses and for 7,000 households to acquire homes under the shared ownership scheme. Investment in additional accommodation for the homeless and for Travellers is also included.</P>
    <P>Resources are being provided for the remedial works scheme which targets the improvement and upgrading of low cost, pre-1960 dwellings and run-down urban estates. Area based regeneration initiatives to restore the physical fabric of established areas and to support local communities will also be supported, most notably the redevelopment of Ballymun and a number of inner city flat complexes. The previous Government announced the redevelopment of Ballymun but, in typical fashion, provided no funding for a project estimated to cost over £350 million.</P>
    <P>This Government has also significantly increased the funding available and improved the range of schemes providing targeted assistance to improve the living conditions of those most vulnerable and those with special needs. We have increased the effective maximum disabled person's grant available from £8,000 to £14,000 and allowed 90% of the cost to be recouped as opposed to the two thirds of cost grant we inherited. We have increased the effective maximum essential repairs grant from £1,800 to £6,000 and extended the scheme to urban areas. Funding for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly has been increased to record levels &ndash; from £4 million in 1997 to £8 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>Investment in the local authority and social housing programmes is over £440 million in 2000, up almost 150% on the £180 million the previous Government provided in the 1997 Estimates. A multi-annual approach to the local authority housing programme has been adopted which will allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the 22,000 additional local authority houses to be started over the next four years.</P>
    <P>One wonders how much thought the proponents of this motion have given to the implications of their demands of 50,000 new houses to be built by local authorities for the next four years. It will put local authorities under considerable pressure to deliver the local authority multi-annual programme together with a greatly expanded voluntary housing programme as well <Col N="95" /> as securing increased output under the affordable housing scheme and the range of other social and affordable housing measures already in train.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the practical constraints, however, the effect of the suggested crash programme of local authority house building would inevitably see a return to the provision of large, soulless, peripheral local authority housing estates, remote from good public transport, amenities or jobs. This is not a policy which this Government will countenance. I challenge the Labour Party to say whether it supports the building of large-scale local authority housing schemes and perhaps it would identify some areas where those schemes might be built.</P>
    <P>When I allocated housing starts to the local authorities last year I asked them to front-load their building programmes as much as possible to meet increased needs. The implementation of this programme is being followed up by my Department and my officials have been saying to local authorities that they should try to start as many houses as they are capable of commencing this year. In effect, they have a <i>carte blanche</i> to start as many as they wish and the Department will facilitate them in doing so. Funding is not a barrier and no local authority is being refused capital funding.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Labour Party is quite capable of saying different things to different people, depending on which audience it is facing. It is calling for the provision of 50,000 local authority houses in this Chamber, yet its members are quite capable of going back to their local authority areas and opposing individual developments on the ground. I can find no evidence of a strong push for more local authority housing from Labour councillors in their own local authorities. Let us see the evidence of their campaign in each local authority for more social housing. There is none and its absence only serves to show the hypocrisy of this motion.</P>
    <P>We recently saw Deputy Gilmore express his concern over the number of vacant housing units in the Dublin area, saying that these should be immediately made available to those on the waiting lists. These concerns are shallow indeed and he deliberately avoided saying why many flats in the Dublin area are vacant. The practical explanation for the increase in the number of vacant flats in Dublin in recent months is that the Department is funding major renovations to a series of flat complexes in the inner city which require major regeneration. This work is now commencing and it is necessary for Dublin Corporation to vacate the flats and move tenants to other accommodation. Examples of where these major renovations are being undertaken include St. Joseph's Mansions, St. Michael's Estate and within the Ballymun area.</P>
    <P>These are concrete examples of important regeneration programmes being funded by my Department and they are being progressed on the ground. Does Deputy Gilmore not support these <Col N="96" /> major projects or is he suggesting that we abandon them completely and simply relet what is substandard accommodation to those on waiting lists? He will be familiar with this type of project in his own local authority area and I am confident that he is not suggesting that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council should abandon the redevelopment of the Hillview Court flats in Ballinteer and relet the flats which are about to be demolished.</P>
    <P>This Government recognises the important contribution to social housing needs by the voluntary housing sector and is committed to increasing output from the sector. This commitment is reflected in the national development plan which provides for the necessary resources for the sector.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Labour Party is belatedly supporting the strengthening and resourcing of the voluntary housing sector. When I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the voluntary sector was practically on its knees because the funding available had not kept pace with the increase in building and tender costs. The levels of assistance available under both voluntary housing schemes operated by my Department were increased substantially on two occasions since this Government took office &ndash; in November 1997 and again in October 1999 &ndash; to take account of rising construction costs and to stimulate greater activity in the voluntary housing sector. In addition, for the first time, additional assistance towards site acquisition costs by voluntary bodies was introduced. These steps have resulted in increased activity at local level in the voluntary housing sector. The levels of assistance to this sector will be kept under review on an ongoing basis by the Government.</P>
    <P>Further steps which have been implemented aimed at facilitating the growth of the sector include the establishment within the Department of a dedicated unit with responsibility for all aspects of voluntary housing and a remit to expand and develop the sector. A working group on voluntary housing has been established to identify and advise on changes to procedures and schemes governing the voluntary housing sector, on ways of further expanding the sector and of increasing its output. The group consists of representatives of the voluntary and co-operative housing movement and local authority and Department officials.</P>
    <P>This Government has provided the increased support to the voluntary housing sector that the Labour Party only talks about and I am committed to continuing this support.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to tackling the problem of homelessness. As a measure of its commitment, it recently launched the integrated strategy on homelessness which offers a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. The strategy aims to provide an integrated response from all statutory and voluntary agen<Col N="97" /> cies providing services to the homeless. The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented.</P>
    <P>Under the strategy each county and county borough is required to establish a homeless forum, for the delivery of homeless services on a joint basis, consisting of representatives from the local authorities within their area, the health board and the voluntary bodies operating in the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crawford, Clune, Cosgrave, Neville and Perry.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes this motion in the name of the Labour Party as another opportunity for the House to debate the appalling record to date of the current Government. When it comes to the housing market, this Government has a difficulty with the concept of political accountability. It finds it difficult to understand that it has been in office for the past three years, during which time the housing crisis has gone from bad to worse. According to the Government, the problem is the fault of planners, landowners, housing departments and An Bord Pleanála. The only skill the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Ministers of State, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Dan Wallace, have shown in the housing debate is the constant ability to blame everyone but themselves for this housing crisis. No one in Government is taking responsibility for this problem. It is high time the Government was honest enough to admit its policies to date have not worked and, if anything, have fuelled an increase in house prices over the past three years.</P>
      <P>Since the Government took office in 1997 house prices have virtually doubled, the national housing list now consists of 100,000 men, women and children, rents have increased beyond reasonable levels and the appalling problem of homelessness is still waiting to be tackled. The housing market is in chaos and seems unresponsive to any set of proposals the Government offers. The fundamental response by Government is that house prices will stabilise when housing supply meets demand. While there is no doubt a radical increase in the number of housing units is required urgently, this policy alone cannot solve the problem for people on average incomes. The market simply cannot bring about greater affordability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask how many houses will we have to build before supply meets demand? Dr. Bacon's latest report seems to suggest that a housing output level of 55,000 units per annum should be our new national target. Even if the supply of houses to the market met the current demand, however, price stabilisation would still not deliver a house to people on income of less than £40,000. The fixation with the concept of supply and demand &ndash; this wonderful Progressive Democrat concept and now part and parcel of Fianna Fáil ideology &ndash; as <Col N="98" /> the only policy response of Government to date would permanently block out of the housing market an entire generation of young Irish people.</P>
    <P>From Dr. Bacon's recent assessment of the housing market two startling observations come to light. First, the position of the first time buyer in the housing market has been eroded since 1997 and, second, despite the measures announced in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, speculation has returned as a factor in fuelling house price inflation. On the first observation, I have repeatedly drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that fewer people applied for the first time buyers' grant in 1999 than in any year since 1995. While the Government boasts that housing output has virtually doubled since 1995, reaching a total of approximately 47,000 homes last year, why is it the case that fewer new house grants have been paid by the Department? In 1995 10,155 first time buyers' grants were sanctioned by his Department while in 1999 the figure was just 9,129. How can housing output virtually double when the number of people who are the key group in terms of buying new homes reduces in size?</P>
    <P>It is facetious to suggest that young couples and individuals are buying second-hand homes as their first house option. Proportionately the second-hand housing market is more expensive than that for new houses. The question must be asked who is buying the new housing units coming on the market?</P>
    <P>Last August I had the temerity to suggest that speculation had returned to the housing market. On that occasion I pointed out that the 1998 housing statistic bulletin showed that approximately one third of all new homes built in 1998 were purchased without mortgage finance. The conclusion I drew from this data was that investor demand within the first time buyers' market had re-emerged as a major problem. I was even so bold as to suggest that a large proportion of new homes were purchased for investor demand. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's response to my analysis in September last year was to castigate my views as misleading and erroneous. He further suggested that house buying for investment was not a problem &ndash; I use this as the first piece of evidence in my contribution tonight &ndash; when he baldly told <i>The Irish Times</i> that house buying for investment was not a problem. The newspaper article on Saturday, 14 August, 1999, read, &ldquo;Minister dismisses misleading claim by Fine Gael TD&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following the latest economic analysis, it is high time the Minister of State engaged in some backtracking. When he speaks I hope he will use this debate to apologise formally for his failure to acknowledge the problem of investor demand, now that the extent of the problem has been recognised by Dr. Bacon.</P>
    <P>This debate provides us with an opportunity to concentrate our minds on the appalling situation which now exists for those people who are squeezed out of the housing market. In a special <Col N="99" /> way we must concentrate on the problems of first time buyers. Fine Gael believes that a special package of measures must now be introduced to give first time buyers a hope of finding a home. First, the Government should move to accept the Fine Gael proposal outlined over 18 months ago to abolish stamp duty on the sale of second-hand homes to first time buyers. The Government has repeatedly rejected this Fine Gael proposal, although it now seems their economic advice is to the contrary. We will wait and see.</P>
    <P>Second, consideration should be given to removing or reducing indirect taxation on the sale of homes to average income couples or first time buyers. It is an irony that VAT receipts from housing now make up a massive pool of resources for the Minister for Finance and are in effect another barrier to home ownership for thousands of young couples.</P>
    <P>Third, local authorities should be building homes on subsidised sites for those locked out of the housing market. Where land does not exist for house building, special powers should be introduced to either a local or national authority, as proposed in the Labour Party motion, for the purposes of providing affordable accommodation. A recent analysis by the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the availability of zoned and serviced land shows an abundance of land which could be used for housing development. It is unacceptable that a landowner can intentionally hoard land for the purposes of trying to control the market price of land. Land which is zoned as residential must be put on the market at the earliest possible time. Whether this can be achieved by way of compulsory purchase or through a range of taxation measures in an attempt to force the sale of land is a matter that needs to be resolved in this House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My party was the first to propose giving a national authority specific new powers for the purposes of house building. It is high time we moved away from a piecemeal, development-led approach to residential planning. The problem faced today in terms of a chronic shortage of housing and a Third World public transport system can only be addressed when we take a long-term approach to sustainable planning. Fine Gael believes this House should designate lands for the purposes of accelerated development in parts of the country where it is possible to increase housing output radically. Special development zones for housing along strategic transport corridors offer a real solution to the problem of increasing the housing supply. Unlike the Government, Fine Gael has already published the areas where this accelerated development needs to take place. The country cannot wait for a spatial strategy which is currently under examination by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The function of the House is to take important decisions in connection with potential growth <Col N="100" /> centres which should be designated as part of a new spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>Whatever reason the current Government has failed to propose areas of the country for future residential development, the matter needs to be advanced. I believe the Government is taking this decision from purely a political perspective. Hard decisions such as this cannot be left until after the next general election. None of us should underestimate the challenge of providing close to 500,000 new homes in the next ten years. It cannot be achieved through piecemeal development or by one local authority jealously guarding its interests over those of another. If we are to be successful it requires the Government taking decisions in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Using the concept of strategic development zones, already a feature of the Planning and Development Bill, we can deliver increasing housing supply along existing transport corridors. However, by putting off the inevitable decision in terms of the spatial strategy and deciding on the areas which need to be developed the Government will add further pressure to the housing market.</P>
    <P>As the motion suggests and as my party first proposed in A Plan for the Nation and in our policy document, Affordable Housing for All, bold decisions must be taken if we are to deliver a major increase in the national house building programme. For the first time in a generation the economy has the resources to build affordable homes and new infrastructure. It is suggested by some that we do not have the labour force to meet this challenge. It is ironic that many Irish engineering and construction firms are contributing their ingenuity and labour to much smaller infrastructural projects abroad. Large scale international construction firms will come to Ireland to build a new integrated satellite town or to renovate an existing small town if the scale of the development is large enough. The problem is that virtually all our development has been of a scale which does not lend itself to international tendering and competition. For this to take place a revolution will be necessary in the way in which we plan and develop our residential and commercial communities.</P>
    <P>There was a time when we prided ourselves on building houses for people on low incomes. In 1975, one third of all houses built were part of the local authority house building programme. By 1985 the figure was 27% and by 1995 the figure was 10%. The provision of affording housing by local authorities should be a sign of State support to poor and low income families. The greatest scandal in the current housing crisis is the appalling record of the Government in the provision and co-ordination of the local authority house building programme. We are spending the same percentage of the national capital budget in 2000 as in 1995. Yet, over the period the number of applicants looking for homes from their respective local authorities has more than doubled. The problem of the national housing list is now so <Col N="101" /> acute that many see the prospect of homelessness as their best option in order to improve their chance of getting a local authority home.</P>
    <P>Each year the Minister makes a commitment to build new homes in the social housing sector. Yet the out-turn from money voted by this House fails to meet demand. For example, in 1998 he promised 3,900 new local authority homes while only 3,304 were built and the position was similar in 1999, which saw a significant increase in the money provided for the local authority house building programme. A national agency is necessary not just to assemble land banks for social housing, but to provide better co-ordination of each local authority house building programme. I have argued repeatedly that there should be a single agency in the Dublin region given the acute problems which exist. To date the Government has sat on its hands and repeatedly blamed local authorities for their failure to provide additional housing units. If the Minister believes local authorities cannot deliver a radical increase in housing output he should intervene in the market.</P>
    <P>The Government has also failed to take action in the private rented sector. During the lifetime of the Dáil rents have spiralled and the Government has consistently failed to modernise legislation is respect of tenant security. Ireland is the only country in the EU which affords virtually no protection to people who have short-term leases.</P>
    <P>The motion highlights the incompetence of the Government and the way ahead for a future Government concerned about the provision of homes for our people at an affordable price. This will be the key issue and the Achilles heel for the Government in the next election, which will be sooner than we think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing remains the most important issue for families and is causing serious problems in terms of inflation. A house in Monaghan which cost £85,000 when sold as new four years ago was bought for £140,000 two years ago and was sold recently for around £250,000. This is what is happening in one rural town, never mind what is happening in Dublin city. Young couples with ordinary jobs cannot afford mortgages. Yet those who are well paid and who got the most tax benefits in the budget can buy and rent houses for all sorts of commercial purposes, a situation which must be curtailed. Perhaps this year's fifth budget of the Minister for Finance, due in the next day or so, may address this issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the commitment by the Government to the restoration of grants for the rebuilding or restoring of old houses. This is one of the issues on which the Government came to power, but three years later nothing has happened. The scheme was very beneficial in the restoration of many rural homes and small villages in the past and must be revisited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for more social housing and group homes for the elderly. When we canvass in villages and other areas we find many three and four bedroomed homes with one inhabitant. <Col N="102" /> There is no doubt that many more family homes could be made available if more thought was put into how we could bring the elderly and others together, ensuring they were much safer in the process.</P>
    <P>Many have already pointed to the need for more local authority houses. There is a problem with sites in this regard. One must wonder what was happening when one thinks back on the days of the slush fund when the then Minister, Mr. Flynn, decided to sell the land.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 600 people on the waiting list in County Monaghan. My colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, blamed both the current and previous Administrations, saying the two main parties had failed to do anything about housing. However, Monaghan was granted funding for 28 houses but the Sinn Féin led urban council failed to build them leaving the position in Monaghan town even worse as a direct result of incompetence. It is sad when money which is available is not used.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem with the points system. People in good quality flats or houses, which is sometimes the only accommodation they can find, cannot get on the housing list or if they can, they are placed towards the bottom. People must almost be homeless or on the road before they are considered.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with new estates. There was an auction in the 1977 general election to see who would form the next Government and rates were abolished. The responsibility for estates is no longer in the hands of UDCs and there are many unfinished buildings and much less playground accommodation then there would be if rates had not been abolished. We must learn from that and try to do something to salvage the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the serviced land initiative. Promises were made 18 months ago but nothing has really happened in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another serious cause of the increase in the value of sites is the fact that there is an insufficient number of planners. Recently Monaghan County Council advertised for new planners and, although a number of people applied, nobody went for interview. This is something we must examine seriously if we are to ensure that permissions applied for are responded to on time, rather then applicants being sent requests for further information at the end of the two month period. This is causing many problems in the housing market and leading to an increase in the cost of sites.</P>
    <P>The problems in Dublin, 80 to 100 miles away, may seem distant but they are causing a serious crisis for young people in third level education. The percentage of young people from County Monaghan attending third level is one of the lowest in the country, partly because of the cost of accommodation in places such as Dublin. It is almost out of reach. The issues raised by my colleague, the restructuring of rents and long-term leases, are vitally important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> I wish to refer to the outrageous situation within health boards and the so-called initiatives administered by county councils. Elderly persons who have no toilet or bathroom facilities are being asked to have the work done themselves, which will be funded if they can find a builder to do it. It is important that they are looked after. They served the nation in the past and it is completely unacceptable that they should have to live in such conditions in this day and age.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned I was reflecting on amendments which, if other things happen, will have to be made to the text of section 4, on which amendment No. 18 touches. The provisions of paragraphs (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) will have to be changed. They relate to development by the council of a county in its functional area, exclusive of any borough or urban district; development by the corporation of a county or other borough in that borough; and development by the council of an urban district in that district. If the Minister has his way all those references will disappear and be replaced by the term &ldquo;town council&rdquo;. This will mean different things in different places as not all town councils will be same. Some &ndash; those now known as town commissioners &ndash; will have no planning functions, while others &ndash; those now known as urban district councils and boroughs which have corporations &ndash; will have exactly the same planning functions as they have now.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Minister says, it is proposed to deprive the five boroughs of Kilkenny, which has been described as a city for several hundred years &ndash; the marble city &ndash; Clonmel, Wexford, Sligo and Drogheda of something they now have and which they regard as being rather important. No matter how much the Minister explains that he is not changing their functions, he still cannot get away from the fact that his reaction to the way in which people see this bureaucratic proposal to simplify the terminology that the Department has to use has turned it into a studied insult, particularly to the population of the city of Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>We will not get to the Local Government Bill this session and it remains to be seen if we will get to it in this Dáil. The issue raised by Deputy Gilmore about the propriety of the procedures for planning will continue to be important for these five boroughs but we will have to remember that, if the Minister gets his way, they will have to be referred to in the same way which will mean different things in different places.</P>

      <P>There is nothing daft about bringing the language used in legislation up to date and using 21st rather than 16th, 17th or 18th century terms. We can resume the discussion when the Local Government Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a repetition of the long debate on Committee Stage during which I said that I would not accept the amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore. My position has not changed. Section 4(1) reads, &ldquo;The following shall be exempted developments for the purposes of this Act..&rdquo; The Deputy is making the case that planning permission will not be required in the case of paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>l</i>), but that is not the case. If paragraph (<i>b</i>) was deleted, as suggested, county councils would effectively be required to apply to themselves for planning permission. We discussed this matter previously and I do not propose to require local authorities to do this. The argument that this would be more democratic is nonsensi<Col N="105" /> cal. As soon as one would apply the normal planning procedure and require a local authority to apply to itself for planning permission, somebody would claim that this was nonsense and that the local authority would be biased in considering its own planning application.</P>
    <P>It is important always to bear in mind that the exemption to which we refer here as distinct from some of the other exemptions for local development, does not mean local authorities can do what they want. In the first place they cannot carry out works which would materially contravene the development plan and except for very small scale works, they must either undergo the public notification procedures set out in section 163, which to date were known as Part X procedure or they must make an environmental impact assessment subject to the approval of An Bord Pleanála under section 159. The Part X procedure is subject to the democratic control of the elected members. Those provisions mean that local authorities are prevented from materially contravening the development plan. I do not intend to accept that amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore sought clarification of the meaning of paragraph (<i>f</i>) which he thought did not bring about a change of substance. My amendment No. 19 does not change the substance of the provisions because paragraph (<i>f</i>) is critical to our plans to introduce public private partnerships for local authority infrastructure. Those developments will be subject to the same local democratic controls as local authority own developments or if they are not undergoing the Part X or section 163 procedure, they will be subject to the approval of the board where an EIA is involved. For that reason I do not propose to accept amendment No. 20 either.</P>
    <P>We had a long debate on this. Local authority development will be subject to democratic control even in the case of PPPs and will be subject to planning and the development plan. On that basis I do not intend to accept the amendments.</P>

With its charters it has at all stages been regarded as a city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, Deputy John McGuinness, wrote an open letter to him spelling out in detail what it meant in Kilkenny. If the Minister insists on this, I am sure the Deputy will vote against it. The Taoiseach is reported as saying there will not be a change in the status of Kilkenny. Is he playing with words or is the Minister out of touch with what is happening? Will he explain what is going on? Is the Taoiseach right in saying there will not be a change? Is Deputy McGuinness serious about not supporting the Minister in this measure? How can the Minister decide that he will change the status of Kilkenny <Col N="106" /> seeing that it has always been regarded as a city since the 1600s?</P>

      <P>As I indicated earlier, I do not propose to press amendment No. 18, which deals with the exemption of local authorities because of the existence of the Part X procedure. The Minister stated that his amendment which replaces paragraph (<i>f</i>), amendment No. 19, does not change significantly the content of paragraph (<i>f</i>). I thought that was the case. I disagree with the Minister on this matter. The PPP arrangements should be subject to the planning process. There should be a requirement to apply for planning permission on the part of what will be private companies. I do not see the difficulty. I do not see how it is so critical to the concept of PPPs that they should be exempted development. Therefore, I intend to press amendment No. 20.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 26, line 36, after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; to insert <Col N="107" />&ldquo;save that, in relation to works carried out by a statutory undertaker for the time being, the planning authority shall require that any land affected by the works shall be restored to a satisfactory condition on completion of the works, and the planning authority may, in the case of unsatisfactory completion, itself carry out the restoration and recover the cost thereof as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 deals with a matter raised by Deputy Gilmore earlier on his own amendment. He referred to the multiplicity of undertakers and the various things they do in terms of digging up roads often, as I think he said, in series. This is true. We frequently find that the ESB digs up a road and restores it and then another authority digs up the same piece of road, etc. There are examples of this just across the road. Last year there was a hole in the road outside Setanta House which seemed to attract various undertakers like a honey pot attracts flies and it was open for a long time. There was a period where temporary coverings of thick steel plate were put on the road. One would expect to see them in rather undeveloped cities in Eastern Europe, but one sees them in Dublin and in some other parts. If these steel plates are not applied properly, they tend to be a little loose. One end of such a plate can be raised when a vehicle goes across the other end of it. They are a serious danger and I shudder to think what damage they might have done to cars and other vehicles going over them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide some certainty for the general public. We have all come across cases where a statutory undertaker in the meaning of this legislation carries out work, fills up the hole, puts a little tar on the top and leaves a bump. They seem to feel that the passage of time, feet, vehicles, etc, will flatten down the bump and eventually it will be as good as it was before, and, of course it never is. Frequently there is a period during which there is a bump where the surface was to have been restored and after a while with the traffic passing by there is a depression because the job had not been properly finished. Local authorities seem to be extremely reluctant to take any real steps to get people to restore surfaces to the way they were before they carried out their work.</P>
    <P>I propose that the local authorities shall require that the surfaces be restored satisfactorily and in the event that that is not possible, that the local authorities would carry out the job and be entitled to recover the cost from the statutory undertaker as a normal debt.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister seemed to have some sympathy with this but did not think the way I proposed to go about it was the most appropriate way. I have examined these amendments as carefully as I could, given the amount of time we have had for them, so far but have not found anything that indicates the Minister has <Col N="108" /> proposed anything. If I am wrong I will be delighted to hear it.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any other provision I recommend to the Minister that he accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this in discussing an earlier amendment. I indicated at that time, as I did on Committee Stage, that this should be dealt with in separate legislation. That is what I intend to do. I repeated that undertaking in the House earlier this evening, in connection with an amendment on which Deputy Gilmore spoke. I stated that a planning and development Bill is not the place to deal comprehensively with the issue of road openings, though I accept the point that it is something that needs to be dealt with. The most effective way of doing that is through separate legislation.</P>
      <P>As I also indicated earlier, the Department has contacted the Dublin Transportation Office to discuss and to assess, in consultation with the local authorities in the DTO area, to what extent the approach taken to the opening and reinstatement of roads and paths for the installation of telecommunications infrastructure could be better managed.</P>
      <P>We are pursuing those contacts. I assure the Deputy that this matter will be dealt with by way of separate legislation. It is not appropriate to deal with it here nor could we do it adequately within the confines of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Deputy Gilmore Deputy Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes. While I welcome the commitment the Minister has given here and which he previously gave on Committee Stage concerning the introduction of separate legislation to deal with the issue of road openings, the multiplicity of bodies involved, the problems associated with reinstatement and the traffic implications and so on, I stress again the urgency to deal with this.</P>
      <P>This problem exists now. The road opening activity and the disruption to traffic is taking place now. We are spending and will continue to spend a fortune, attempting to deal with traffic problems, the provision of new roads, public transport, the Luas project and so on. A huge contributor to the disruption of traffic in this city is the frequency of road openings. It will get worse. There is an urgency about this.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister has directed his Department and presumably the local authorities to talk to the DTO concerning the situation in Dublin. However, in the absence of legislation, it will be difficult for the DTO to manage the problem, as the Minister said. The problem is that all that the statutory undertakers have to get for road opening is a road opening licence from the local authority. Advance planning is not required. They go to the local authority seeking a road opening licence and, except in very exceptional circumstances, they have to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> There should be a requirement on the various bodies which plan such things well in advance. They know where they will lay cables and do such work. They should be required to make application to the local authority or the DTO or whatever, stating well in advance that they propose to lay cables or renew cabling etc. and will need to open a road or street. That would enable the local authority to co-ordinate the activities of a number of agencies so that if a certain number of agencies wished to undertake work within the same time frame they must co-operate and do the work simultaneously and conditions could be made stipulating the exact time the work would be carried out. It is absolute madness that statutory undertakers make savings for themselves on the cost of doing this work by not engaging contractors who will work at night or at weekends or other off-peak periods. They insist on working in the middle of the day, at the busiest times of the day when it causes the most traffic disruption. In most other cities in most other countries we see much of this work done at night and at off-peak times. Here, it seems that, in order to save on premium overtime rates, the work is done during the normal working day.</P>
    <P>There is a significant amount of work to be done and it should be done soon. I support the amendment Deputy Dukes has submitted, which is in line with amendments I submitted earlier, because one of the problems with this is that it is excluded from the planning process. There is no obligation on the statutory undertakers to apply for planning permission. The only thing they need is the road opening licence and in normal circumstances that cannot be refused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Deputy Dukes Deputy Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore and, not to be churlish about it, it is welcome news that the Minister has taken the steps he has in relation to consulting the DTO. This is not, however, a problem that happens only in Dublin. This happens throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am not at all persuaded that the DTO has the necessary powers to ensure this. It can be done. To my recollection, if the plans have not been changed substantially since June 1997, it is specifically written into the Luas project that there will be a co-ordinated approach to the relocation of certain services along the Luas route. I gather they are all to be moved to one side of the road with the necessary separation between water, sewerage, electricity services and so on.</P>
      <P>It can be done, if properly programmed, but not every project can be organised like the Luas and not every undertaker is in the situation that lends itself to that type of co-ordination. Somebody must do it. Deputy Gilmore is right in that it seems to be done most often in a way that is of convenience to the contractor or statutory undertaker doing the work and not for the convenience of the public.</P>
      <P>When are we likely to see that separate legislation? Will he give us some kind of time frame on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="110" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot indicate a time scale. As I said earlier this evening, when the discussion arose on Committee Stage and again tonight, a good case was made and I accepted it and made it clear that separate legislation was required. Following that, I have put matters in train in the Department to start work on a Bill but the Deputies, from their experience, will know that at this early stage of drafting legislation it would be difficult to predict when it might be complete.</P>
      <P>I guarantee that it will be pursued, particularly in light of the comments made by Deputy Gilmore regarding the urgency of the matter. I understand that about 30 telecommunications companies operate in the country at this stage. It is urgent and it will be treated as such.</P>
      <P>We are dealing in this section with exempted development and what is meant by that term. While it is useful to have the debate on the amendment, it would have the effect, notwithstanding the fact that the repair or renewal by statutory undertakers of underground pipelines and cables is exempted development, of making the planning authority require that roads be reinstated to a satisfactory condition. There is a <i>non sequiter</i> in that because local authorities generally do not have contact with this type of development from a planning perspective prior to the work being done.</P>
      <P>We have a clear idea in the Department about what we want. As soon as the heads of the Bill are brought to me, I will bring them to Government as a matter of urgency and then to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished by what the Minister has said. First, there is the approach to new legislation and not knowing when it can be done &ndash; a case of &ldquo;live horse and get grass&rdquo; in that we will continue to have this problem. Second, it is not enough to say that the Dublin Transportation Office is being asked to take certain action. I have doubts about the efficacy of the DTO in Dublin, although that is not to insult the people involved. It is just that it does not have the powers. Third, this is a problem which exists throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not a <i>non sequiter</i>. In making the amendment to the section, I do not create a contradiction in planning law nor do I interfere with the exempt status of these developments. Local authorities have a duty in the public interest to ensure that surfaces which are broken into are properly restored afterwards. That does not interfere with the status of exempted development, but it is a provision of common prudence. I am not happy with the Minister's reaction and I intend to press the amendment.</P>

As drafted, the Bill allowed exemptions to be granted only when a proposed development would have limited effect on its surroundings. However, some developments are authorised under other enactments &ndash; for example, the Fisheries Acts &ndash; and may already have gone through extensive consultation with the public and extensive consultation procedures generally, so there is no need to duplicate these procedures with the requirement to obtain planning permission. Therefore, I am providing that the Minister can, by regulations, declare such development to be exempt from the planning Acts.</P>
    <P>As a result, the need to provide for a similar exemption in section 178(1)(<i>a</i>) for State development which must undergo other public consultation procedures is redundant. My amendment to that section, therefore, deletes the power to grant an exemption to State development under subsection (1)(<i>a</i>)(ii). This amendment has the same effect as Deputy Dukes's amendment to this section.</P>

      <P>I am always concerned about exemptions. On Committee Stage I indicated I had reservations about giving the Minister power to exempt, by order, various classes of development. The original version of this provision would have allowed the Minister to exempt classes of development that had little impact on the environment. He proposes to give himself power to exempt developments which are already covered under other enactments and have been the subject of other consultation procedures. I would like to hear the Minister expand further on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reception facilities for refugees and asylum seekers is an area where there would be public consultation. Do I take it that would be exempt from planning permission as it is covered under other enactments or could be regarded as the administration of justice or whatever? Development that might be carried out by a health board, <Col N="114" /> the provision of certain services, for example, that might be subject to a consultation procedure initiated by the health board could be exempted because the consultation procedure had been undertaken.</P>
    <P>The purpose of one consultation procedure does not necessarily mean that the planning issues have been taken into account. The Minister mentioned fisheries. The consultation procedure might concentrate on that dimension. There might be an aqua-cultural development where it might concentrate on the impact on water and so on whereas different issues might arise with the physical development on land. I am concerned about this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards reception facilities for asylum seekers, the consultations and so on are not dealt with under the exemption but under separate legislation and an emergency order which gives the State the right to provide such facilities where an emergency arises.</P>
      <P>A fisheries licence is required to develop a fish farm. Public notification must be given and submissions sought. The decision, which may be appealed, is made by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. That is, and will continue to be, the procedure following the passage of this Bill. It would be nonsensical to have two separate procedures.</P>
      <P>A fisheries operation would go through this procedure under the licensing system. If the company wanted to process fish onshore, the building would be subject to the normal planning requirements. The amendment is not seeking to extend powers but merely recognises the position as it is and ensures we do not have conflict where a person goes through one procedure and gets a licence and then goes through the same procedure under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 27, lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;, on payment of the prescribed fee,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister believe it is necessary or appropriate to make a charge for referring a question to a local authority as to what is or is not development? Section 5 provides that if there is any question in relation to a particular case as to whether works proposed to be carried out are or are not development the person concerned may apply to the planning authority for a ruling. The Minister proposes to charge a fee for this and my amendment is designed to delete that. It is not obvious that it is fair to make a charge for such a request. Unless I am mistaken, the approach in this section is not followed through in the Bill, nor am I suggesting that it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> As regards the parts of the Bill that incorporate legislation we passed last year regarding architectural heritage, there is provision for persons who want to carry out work to a listed building to ask the planning authority if the work he or she proposes to carry out is allowable because of the status of the building. As far as I know, there is no fee for getting a ruling on that. Our concern is to ensure we preserve the character of such buildings. Is there any logic in taking that approach, which I support, to listed buildings and then making a charge for other development simply for the purpose of telling people if the work they carry out is development? A request of that kind is a proper request for information and is properly made to the planning authority. It should not carry a fee.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that, if anything, my record on encouraging local authorities to make charges is longer and more consistent than his and most other Members. It is not obvious to me that it is right to charge for information which an intending developer is entitled to ask. There is no persuasive case to be made for it and I do not see why the Minister should make a charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would delete the provision requiring a fee to be paid to the local authority for a declaration as to what is or is not exempted development. It is reasonable for a person to pay for this service. Under section 5, the fee is paid to the board and I do not propose to delete this requirement.</P>
      <P>I examined the various requirements to pay a fee under this section and have tabled amendments Nos. 25, 27 and 28 which would require a fee to be paid by all parties seeking a declaration from the planning authority or a determination by the board. The obligation to pay a fee will apply equally to the planning authority as to an individual applicant. The fee will not be large but will go some way towards the local authority's or the board's administrative costs.</P>
      <P>The section provides for a fee to be paid to the local authority. This procedure is not like asking a local authority to check one's driving licence or whatever. The local authority is providing a service on the basis that it is giving an interpretation of the law to the applicant. An applicant has the alternative of seeking a legal opinion from a solicitor or barrister as to whether a development is exempted. However, in most cases, the fee involved would be far higher than that intended by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not persuaded by the Minister's last argument. A person can obtain an opinion from a solicitor or barrister with all the risks that such opinions carry. I will not be too specific but I have seen legal opinions of provisions in this Bill which seem very doubtful but we will come to that later. The Minister knows what I am talking about and that I am not per<Col N="116" /> suaded by legal opinions which do not have a leg on which to stand.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes risky to consult lawyers. When doctors differ patients die, but the more lawyers differ the more money they make. I am not sure it is proper to ask people to pay a fee for a determination of the law by a planning authority. In any case, a determination obtained from a planning authority is not necessarily definitive and beyond challenge. I do not wish to open a vista of endless recourse to legal proceedings but the Bill sets out what is regarded as exempted development and there will be no doubt in most cases. However, if there is a doubt it is reasonable that the publicly constituted authority which has to rule, and that is what planning authorities do, should not charge a fee for someone to find out whether it is of the opinion that a development is exempted.</P>
      <P>I am not consoled by the fact that, as I feared, when the Minister reflected on the issue he found a few more reasons for imposing charges, hence amendments Nos. 25 to 28. I have been on that side of the fence but at least I have the consolation of being able to say I did not provoke the Minister into this course of action. It is not reasonable to charge a fee for what should be public information.</P>

      <P>In page 28, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Board shall issue a decision on the referral and the main reasons on which its decision is based within 4 weeks and shall forthwith communicate these to the person who made the request under <i>subsection (1)</i> and, where appropriate, to the owner and occupier of the land in question and to the planning authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert a new subsection (5) to require the board to give a decision on referrals within four weeks. This is in line with the general dissatisfaction at the length of time it takes to get a decision from An Bord Pleanála. I do not wish to be offensive to anyone on the board but it is taking much longer for the board to give decisions on appeals than contemplated in legislation.</P>
      <P>The issue regards a referral to the board for an opinion and a declaration. The board is not being asked to make a substantive decision on a planning matter but to simply outline the law and it is reasonable to require that it gives its decision within a period of four weeks. Is the Minister going to accept this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>No. This amendment seeks to impose a four week limit on the time allowed for decisions by the board on referrals under section 5. Throughout the Bill we have tried to impose the same time limits and to synchronise time limits for decisions, referrals and appeals as much as possible. It is reasonable to do so.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that many referrals under this section would be relatively simple. However, other referrals may involve inspections and complex issues and four weeks is not sufficient for decisions in a minority of such cases. I would not like to tie the board to such a period. It has the overall aim of dealing with all referrals within 18 weeks and it will give priority to some of these issues. A four week limit might be sufficient in a majority of cases but not in all cases, and the board should be given the flexibility to take whatever time it needs to reach a proper decision. The Deputy can argue that we are catering for a minority of cases but it is important to cater for cases which are somewhat complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concerns, but if we do not apply time limits to such decisions members of the board could take forever to make up their minds. The Minister referred to aligning provisions. Under subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) he proposes to require a planning authority to issue a declaration on a request within four weeks of its receipt. He will require planning <Col N="118" /> authorities to give their views within four weeks, but they have an opt out clause in that they can request additional information. Given that planning authorities are allowed to request additional information after four weeks, one could be forgiven for believing that if an authority receives a referral on, say, Monday, 26 June, it simply diaries it for the Friday almost four weeks later and then decides it is time to act on it. It checks through the file, notes some aspect is unclear and issues a request for further information. That is what is provided for in the section. A planning authority is required to issue the declaration within three weeks of receipt of further information. If the Minister is talking about aligning dates, periods and deadlines, I see nothing wrong with requiring An Bord Pleanála to issue within four weeks its decisions on what will be a much smaller number of referrals to the board compared to applications to planning authorities.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to use his concern to ensure there is alignment to follow the logic of my amendment and to provide for the board to make a decision on a referral within four weeks. That is not an unreasonable request. What is being sought is not a decision on a planning application or an appeal but a declaration as to whether a proposed development is or is not exempt from development, which should be dealt with reasonably expeditiously. Four weeks is not an excessively short or overly constraining time to apply to a decision on a referral by An Bord Pleanála.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy's amendment. Four weeks is a reasonable period for An Bord Pleanála to make a decision on a referral, particularly if an application is in line with the zoning or the designation of the area concerned, as in the case of a commercial development in a commercial area. It is reasonable that An Bord Pleanála should be obliged to make a decision on such a referral within four weeks. Unnecessary delay in a decision by An Bord Pleanála on the referral of an application for a proposed development can cause an applicant extreme financial hardship.</P>

      <P>The Minister of the day has the power under section 124(4) and (5) to vary the timescale that applies to decisions on appeals or referrals to An Bord Pleanála. It is wise not to tie An Bord Pleanála to a four week timescale on such decisions at present. However, with the benefit of experience over time if the Minister of the day believes that reducing that timescale would be consistent with good decision making, it would be open to him or her, under the legislation and through regulations, to do that. I would not like to restrict the planning appeals board to having to make such decisions within four weeks. We do not know on what type of referrals the board will have to make decisions. It is reasonable to allow the board the same time to make such a decision as it has to make a decision on a <Col N="119" /> referral, which is 18 weeks. It can make a decision in a shorter period, but in some cases it requires that timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McCormack: Is the Minister grouping referrals and appeals? Deputy Dukes's amendment relates to referrals, but the Minister referred to appeals and the statutory period within which the planning appeals board can deal with appeals. Referrals are a different matter. When the designation of the land concerned meets what is sought in the referral, the timescale for the decision should not exceed four weeks, as a referral cannot be compared to a planning application on appeal where every detail of the application must be examined.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment requires that the location on applications should be recorded under the appropriate place name referable to a six inch Ordnance Survey map. Two issues arose on this matter on Committee Stage. One was the need to standardise the maps used to identify the location of a planning application and the second was to <Col N="120" /> use the place names on the Ordnance Survey maps. There was considerable debate on the way in which place names change, the fact that place names in their new form are not automatically identifiable in terms of location and that there was a need to standardise matters by ensuring a simple basic reference is used for place names and the locations on planning applications.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether it was the Minister's wish to conclude the debate on the section or that he was greatly struck by the force of the argument I made on Committee Stage that prompted him to promise to reconsider this matter before Report Stage. What consideration has he given this issue? As there is not a ministerial amendment tabled on this matter, is he disposed to accept my amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, I agreed to reconsider the issue of addresses that must be used on planning applications when we discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. The Deputy will recall I pointed out that the name on a six inch map was not appropriate as many of the maps are out of date. Most of them have not been updated since the 1930s. I have established also that the Ordnance Survey Office does not intend to update them since it has moved to the metric system. Therefore, it would not be appropriate at this stage to introduce this type of amendment. While those maps may be suitable for rural areas they do not give sufficient detail for urban areas. The main problem is that Ireland does not have an unique address system, whereby every building has its own number and postal code, as in some other countries. In the absence of such a system there is no standard addressing system that could be applied in respect of planning applications save that it is up to planning authorities to satisfy themselves in regard to the accuracy of the address and to ensure the address on the application is not misleading. Having considered the matter further since Committee Stage I do not think the wording can be improved upon. For the reasons outlined, the amendment, if accepted, would probably give rise to even greater confusion. On that basis I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 29, line 14, after &ldquo;statement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or linguistic impact statement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group of amendments relates to the way in which development is impacting on the Gaeltacht areas. A number of issues arise. Deputy Kelleher made the point on Committee Stage that one of the reasons the Gaeltacht areas survived in the <Col N="121" /> past was that they were remote. It is that very reason that is now putting the Gaeltacht areas at risk from development. Considerable development has taken place recently in Gaeltacht areas. Much of that development &ndash; for example, building luxury homes and holiday homes as well as the arrival of people in Gaeltacht areas who have no affinity with it and no particular knowledge of the Irish language &ndash; is diluting those areas. This is an issue on which national policy must be clear. The official national policy is to preserve parts of the country as areas in which the Irish language is the spoken language of the people.</P>
    <P>We all know the degree to which Irish is spoken in those areas is eroding rapidly. For example, the Connemara Gaeltacht is being pushed further and further west. Any person who is familiar with the constituency boundaries for Údarás na Gaeltachta elections will know there are parts of Galway city and parts east of Galway city which are officially designated as Gaeltacht areas and where the only Irish spoken in those areas is that of the teacher in the primary school when the Irish class is in progress. That has been the case for a long time.</P>
    <P>Many of the Gaeltacht areas, largely because of their remoteness and physical attraction as areas for development, house building and so on, are attracting much development. In these amendments I seek provision for a number of things: first, linguistic impact assessments and statements to be included in planning applications in Gaeltacht areas. This is done in other countries in areas where a language is to be preserved; second, that account of the linguistic impact of development is included in the making of development plans and in the making of regional planning guidelines; and, third, that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands be allowed make regulations governing language related matters which would have to be taken into account by planning authorities in making planning decisions in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>We cannot be blind to the fact that the Gaeltacht areas are at risk. There is no point in pretending otherwise. It appears to me that within a decade, two at most, the Gaeltacht areas will no longer be Gaeltacht areas as we have known them and will no longer be areas in which the language is spoken as the everyday language of the people. This House will have to face that reality. While there is an official policy in regard to preserving the Gaeltacht areas for the Irish language, we all know they are being eroded rapidly. If we are not to keep Gaeltacht areas, we should say so and devise some other means of developing and protecting the language. If there are areas which are designated as the geographical locations in which the Irish language is to be the spoken language, it is not enough to provide deontaisí for bean an tí in respect of students attending Gaeltacht colleges in the summer, to have a separate industrial development authority and to give a nod in acknowledgment of their status as Gaeltacht areas. Steps have to be taken <Col N="122" /> in the planning legislation to ensure they are protected from the type of development which will inevitably erode those areas.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Committee Stage debate I heard Úachtarán, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, on the radio and I was left with the impression that the Minister would introduce some new amendments on Report Stage to address the issues I have raised now and on Committee Stage. However, I do not see any additional amendments other than those on Committee Stage. Perhaps I misunderstood the point being made. The Minister made some changes to the Bill as it was going through which strengthens the position somewhat but he has not gone far enough. I ask him to accept my amendments as they would strengthen enormously the provisions in the Bill to protect and preserve the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a co-sponsor of the amendment and agree with what Deputy Gilmore has said. It is a long time since I first heard that it was virtually impossible for young people in the Connemara Gaeltacht to build a house there. They simply cannot afford to pay the site prices that have resulted from the kind of pressure on development there to which Deputy Gilmore referred and which we spoke about on Committee Stage. Similar problems can be seen in the Kerry Gaeltacht. As far as I know, there is not that particular kind of problem in the Ráth Cairn Gaeltacht, but I have a suspicion that it is being affected by development pressures in the same way as every other part of the country. While there may not be a specific Gaeltacht problem there, young people in that area certainly feel the same pressures concerning the affordability of housing as young people do in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>That is not the end of the matter, of course. With the arrival of the holiday home or second home comes the demand for many other services, perfectly naturally. As Deputy Gilmore said, the expansion of those other services in themselves puts extra pressure on the Gaeltacht. It changes the nature of the area and activities therein, and it means it is more and more difficult to cultivate or develop the essential nature of the cultural entity that is a Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister did come some of the way with us concerning a number of amendments and I congratulate him on doing so, but a good deal more could be done. I note that the Minister has tabled an amendment in the group we are discussing. Amendment No. 115 is a move by the Minister to recognise some of the concerns Deputy Gilmore and I have been articulating. Looking behind the rather opaque wording of that amendment in order to divine its intention, however, I think the Minister's heart is in the right place. It is not a measure that will make a huge difference to the quality of what goes on in respect of developments in Gaeltacht areas, however. It refers to regulations which may be <Col N="123" /> made in respect of developments of a particular class. It requires the Minister, before making those regulations, to consult with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. That is a recognition of some of what we are saying but it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>In cultural terms, the point of requiring a linguistic impact statement is similar to what we hope to bring about in physical planning terms by having an environmental impact statement. It involves the same logic and the same concern with the effect of the development on a particular part of our environment &ndash; in this case on our cultural environment.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Gilmore and I tried to get the title of a Part of the Bill altered in order to make that point. We tabled a series of amendments but the Minister did not accept them. It is a great pity he has not found it possible in the meantime to change his view on that matter. We are discussing the physical development of Gaeltacht areas and we know that the type, quality and direction of physical development will inevitably have fundamental effects on the quality of life and cultural activity in those areas.</P>
    <P>It is no different from any other area and, in fact, it would be fair to compare this to what has happened to the nature of leisure pursuits in Dublin, for example. In terms of leisure, Dublin is a very different place from what it was 30 years ago. It is awful that one feels in a position to say what it was like 30 years ago, but it is a very different place. The cultural life of the capital, in its broadest sense, is very different now and it has been much affected by the kind of development that has taken place since then. Even simple activities, such as going to the cinema, have a very different context and connotation from those of 30 years ago. It is a different kind of event and experience, and much of that difference has been shaped by the kind of development that has taken place.</P>
    <P>Recently, we debated the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. Going out for a drink in much of Dublin these days is a very different activity to what it was 30 years ago. There is an enormous difference between going for a drink in one of the new so-called &ldquo;super pubs&rdquo; and having a drink in an old fashioned local. It is a different kind of activity and ambience, and much of that difference is due to the kind of development that has taken place.</P>
    <P>The same thing has happened in the Gaeltacht areas. A great deal of what affects the life and vibrancy of the Irish language today results from the kind of developments that have taken place in the Gaeltachtaí. Deputy Gilmore and I have set out, at least, to try to know what the nature of that development is so that planning authorities can judge what the effects of given types of proposals will be on the cultural entities that are the Gaeltachtaí. That is the reason for moving an amendment of this kind to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I recognise the fact that in one of the amend<Col N="124" /> ments in this group the Minister is moving some distance towards the direction we have proposed, but it is not enough. The Minister would be thanked in years to come if he were to take a few further steps along the road by accepting this and other amendments in the group.</P>

      <P>I appreciate fully what Deputies Gilmore and Dukes are trying to achieve in moving these amendments. However, I do not know how we can achieve what is sought in the thinking behind those amendments. I would like a greater opportunity than that which is afforded to us on Report Stage to tease out this complex problem more fully. Deputy Gilmore referred to Galway city and the Connemara Gaeltacht and the situation is even more complex there. When I came to live in Galway city 25 years ago the population was 22,000, but at the last census that figure had risen to 66,000 and I am sure it is even higher now.</P>
      <P>Galway city was built on a narrow neck of land between the Corrib and the sea and was completely surrounded by Gaeltacht areas, but it was impossible to stop every city development plan. In 1996 when we got county borough status in Galway and extended the city boundary out into the country, it was all extended into Gaeltacht areas because they completely surround the city, apart from a narrow neck of land on the Oranmore end. There are rural areas east of Galway city where the Irish language has been preserved, for example in Annach Dhún, Baile Claregalway, Castlegar agus Carnmore freisin. Those are real Gaeltacht areas where the native farming people still speak Irish.</P>
      <P>As one goes west into Connemara, Irish is still the spoken language in most homes but the influx of new buildings there, housing people who have come from outside the Gaeltacht, has had an influence. I do not know how one could address the problem in Galway. For example, Tyrellan Heights, which is out the Headford Road, was built in the parish of Castlegar which was a Gaeltacht area. The vast housing estate of Knocknacarrow on the east side of the city was built in the Barna Gaeltacht area. I do not know how it could be arranged that the people who wish to live in those houses could only be from the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Tá a lán daoine as an Ghaeltacht ag obair i gCathair na Gaillimhe. There is a greater diversification of people and many of those from the Gaeltacht go to Galway to socialise and shop. Previously, emigration affected Gaeltacht areas and now immigration may affect them. Those from Gaeltacht areas and families of those who were raised there are returning to live there and are working in Galway city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex problem. In the case of Galway, the sons and daughters of those raised in rural Gaeltacht areas, despite the fact they may now be working in Galway city, should be given the opportunity to build their houses in the Gaeltacht. This should be encouraged in the drawing <Col N="125" /> up of county development plans. Planning permission should be easier to obtain for those from Gaeltacht areas. This would sustain the native Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht areas where they have been born and raised and where they should now be able to settle and raise their families.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments tabled by Deputies Dukes and Gilmore which make a strong statement about our position on the Gaeltacht areas. Their remoteness has been their strength to date but it is now an attraction. These amendments propose the undertaking of a linguistic impact statement. It is important that any planning application or change in a Gaeltacht area should be looked at in terms of its impact on the Irish language and culture, which we are endeavouring to maintain. A strong statement of this nature should be included because the Gaeltacht areas are being diluted and eroded. Any measure weighted in favour of preserving the language is welcome, although anyone can teach a language and it can be learned from cassettes. However, it is the culture and identity that we are so proud of and which makes us unique in Europe. These unique areas should be maintained and anything which will dilute their strength should be assessed in terms of its impact. I support the amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions and the amendments they have tabled. We have had many discussions in the past few months on protecting the Irish language and the cultural and linguistic specialities of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>The original Bill contained provisions to protect Gaeltacht areas and ensure they were not overwhelmed by development. A very delicate balance must be maintained. This is a planning and development Bill which can only go so far in terms of trying to protect the special nature of the Gaeltacht areas. Deputy Higgins outlined an incident involving planning permissions for houses that were obviously going to have a significant impact on a Gaeltacht area. The houses were applied for by the co-op or the comharchumann in the area itself. I am sure the comharchumann&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, it was a local agency. The argument about whether this is necessary for the survival of the Gaeltacht areas by generating income for the local economy <Col N="127" /> comes into it, obviously. However, as I said, I included provisions in this regard in the original Bill because of my concern to ensure we would, as far as practicable within a planning and development Bill, give special recognition and protection to the language, culture and heritage of Gaeltacht areas. It is fair to say that, as the Bill has gone through the various Stages in the Seanad and Dáil, particularly on Committee Stage in the select committee, my thinking has advanced on this and we have advanced the position on each occasion we have debated it.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I undertook to look at the linguistic impact statement and to consider if I could bring forward a suitable alternative amendment because many Deputies had tabled amendments which referred to linguistic impact statements. I had no problem with the concept and the proposed introduction of linguistic impact statements <i>per se</i>. My problem was that there was no clear idea of what a linguistic impact statement was. We discussed this in the House, with officials and so on. I had separate discussions with people in the Gaeltacht in Rathcairn to see if we could come up with a linguistic impact statement that would mean something and that we could incorporate in the Bill, but we did not succeed.</P>
      <P>Following the debate on Committee Stage, I started to see if there was some other way of achieving what was sought in the call for the linguistic impact statements. My amendment to section 33 allows for permission regulations to be made requiring additional information to be submitted with planning applications for development in the Gaeltacht areas. This will assist the planning authorities in determining applications in accordance with their obligations under section 10 to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht. As I said, we have changed the Bill as we have moved along. Section 10 gives a certain amount of protection, and what we are proposing in amendment No. 115 adds to that.</P>
      <P>Those regulations, as Deputy Gilmore suggested in his amendment, will be made in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. My amendment captures the essence of the linguistic impact statements and probably avoids some of the pitfalls and difficulties that might arise in referring to &ldquo;linguistic impact statements&rdquo; when we have no real, clear idea yet of what a linguistic impact statement might be. This amendment, taken in conjunction with the objective in section 10, should meet the Deputies' requirements.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department have met with Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge which expressed itself satisfied with the approach I am now taking. It welcomed the move. Dúirt siad gur céim mór chun cinn ó thaobh cosaint na Gaeilge sa Gaeltacht iad na leasaithe atá cur síos agamsa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputies for acknowledging the fact that, while they are not satisfied I have gone as far as they would like, I have moved fairly sub<Col N="128" /> stantially. We are all anxious to ensure we give the maximum amount of protection to the language and the ethos of Gaeltacht areas. My amendment and the overall objective of the development plan to protect and promote Irish in the Gaeltacht provide a package which will protect the Gaeltacht areas. That should be taken in conjunction with the commitment we have made and the terms of reference of the commission on Irish in the Gaeltacht areas which the Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, is putting in place.</P>
    <P>I have outlined that we should talk in terms of how we are going to give effect to the provisions of this Bill. Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Údarás na Gaeltachta and various other Irish language organisations will undoubtedly be involved in that discussion. I think we will be able to offer protection. The aim of each of us in this House is to develop the Gaeltacht areas as much as possible, not just physically and industrially but also culturally.</P>
    <P>I have given an undertaking that Údarás na Gaeltachta will be a prescribed body. I am not sure if any other Irish language organisation is interested in becoming a prescribed body, but if they are that can be considered.</P>
    <P>A point was made about giving preference to local people and natives of particular areas in terms of development. That is done in some development plans at the moment. I know of at least one local authority that is in trouble about this because people feel it is an anti-foreigner or racist approach to planning. However, it is possible within the current planning laws to stipulate who can get planning permission, particularly for one-off houses in rural, Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance. The decision last week by the European Commission not to approve the plans of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to adopt a particular area based payment to replace headage payments could have far-reaching consequences for many Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness a guarantee was given to the farm organisations that farmers would not lose financially from this <Col N="129" /> major switch from payment based on animals to payment based on area. It now appears that the EU Commission seeks total decoupling of headage payments from animals to a per hectare basis. I have no problem with an area based payment but it must reflect the size of headage payments already received by farmers.</P>
    <P>This is of particular reference to the huge cohort of farmers who qualify for extensification and are in the rural environment protection scheme. This group already farms to a regime of low stocking density but if area payments are structured in a manner that will only suit a farmer with many acres and small livestock numbers, many farmers will lose. If this dilemma cannot be solved, the area based payments will get a bad name.</P>
    <P>This is also important for beef producers with high stocking rates, suckler cow farmers and both hill and lowland sheep farmers. Unless the outcome of the change from headage to area based payments is such that a huge cohort of farmers with only reasonable stocking rates can qualify, there will be extensive opposition to the new regime. An area based payment has certain advantages, one being that it will not matter unduly how many cattle or sheep are on the land. That could result in better quality stock being reared.</P>
    <P>However, the bottom line is whether farmers will be better off next year under the scheme or whether they will lose money they simply cannot afford. Most people would have no trouble with area based payments. The possibility has been debated for a number of years. However, if it means that the European Commission intends to decouple the payments from headage and link them to area, it is essential that the payments are set at a level whereby most farmers will not lose money.</P>
    <P>There is great anxiety on this issue and I know where the Minister's heart lies. An effort was made to overcome the problem. The Minister's largest fight has yet to start, however. Of all the issues that arose in the past three years in rural Ireland, this will be one of the most important. Farmers will not accept a scheme under which they will be obliged to accept less money. Given that fact, there is an onus on the Government to convince the European Union that Irish farmers cannot be permitted to lose the moneys to which they were previously entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Connaughton has raised this important issue and I am happy to provide clarification and an update on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Agenda 2000 agreement, headage grants in the disadvantaged areas are to move from a payment per animal to a payment per hectare basis. This part of the agreement was well signalled at the time. Under transitional arrangements, the headage schemes as they have operated will continue to apply for this year. A new <Col N="130" /> area based scheme is to be introduced with effect from next year. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Department is committed to introducing a system which will protect the payment levels to the categories of farmers for whom disadvantaged areas payments are an important element of their total incomes.</P>
    <P>As provided for in the PPF, a task force representative of my Department and the main farming bodies was established to formulate a new scheme. The task force met on a number of occasions and, having considered a range of options, the group recommended a scheme which would involve, <i>inter alia</i>, a payment per hectare depending on the type of livestock on the holding. It was envisaged that each livestock unit of stock would attract one per hectare payment.</P>
    <P>I announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last. At the same time I announced an increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged areas payments over the period 2000-06. I doubled the headage payments under the sheep regime for the disadvantaged areas. I was satisfied that the proposed scheme fulfilled the Government's commitment in the PPF and it was submitted to the EU Commission as part of the overall rural development plan. It is also important to clarify that this issue does not entail any overall loss of funds to the country or to the farmers in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department met Commission officials last Friday to discuss the proposed scheme. During those discussions, the Commission expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of the scheme mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. Mention was made of the fact that each livestock unit would attract one per hectare payment and this was seen as continuing the link to production.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Department is urgently examining alternative proposals. In this context further consultation will take place with the Commission and the farming bodies, who are the social partners in this case, with a view to formulating a scheme which is acceptable to the Commission. The agreement of the EU Commission is essential. The scheme cannot proceed without its approval. The task, therefore, is to devise a scheme which is best suited to Ireland's requirements but which meets with Commission approval. The scheme is a most important income source and is an important element of the White Paper on Rural Development. I am treating the issue with the seriousness it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The teachers of Asdee national school, County Kerry, have earned a fine reputation over the years for their dedication and commitment to the education of their pupils and for the calibre of individual the school produces <Col N="131" /> in terms of academic achievement and respect for authority.</P>
      <P>The school, by order of the Department of Education and Science, will lose a teacher in the school year September 2000 to 2001. This is because the school had only 82 pupils on 30 September 1999 when the number required for retaining a fourth teacher was 85 pupils. In the forthcoming school year, the number required for a fourth teacher is 83 on 30 September. The principal has informed me that due to the unexpected arrival of five families into the Asdee area, he is confident that he will have 83 pupils on his rolls on 30 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The Department is not satisfied, however, that because the school will have 83 pupils on 30 September, it can retain its fourth teacher for the forthcoming school year. It is insisting that as the school did not have the required number of pupils on 30 September 1999, the post of fourth teacher has now been lost. The school will be obliged to have 88 pupils on its rolls on 30 September 2000, that being the number required for a new appointment, as distinct from the 83 pupils required for retention of a teacher.</P>
      <P>The parents and teachers of the school believe the insistence by the Department on 88 pupils is very unfair. It means in effect that next year there will be only three teachers to teach 83 pupils, whereas this year there were four teachers to teach 82 pupils. Surely this cannot be considered progress. It will also mean that instead of four teachers having two classes each, two teachers will now have three classes and one teacher will have two classes. At the end of the day, the pupils will lose out because of the pupil-teacher ratio and the inconvenience of one teacher trying to teach three classes.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister is not present to address this matter. However, I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the concerns of the teachers and parents of Asdee national school and to postpone the removal of the teacher from the school or taking the teacher off the panel until September when it will be ascertained if there are 83 pupils. This would mean the school could retain the fourth teacher, otherwise there will have to be 88 pupils in order to appoint a new teacher. This presents a major difficulty in a small country area. Unless the Minister rescinds the order as soon as possible, the fourth teacher will leave the school in a week.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to act immediately. This is a small rural school, serving one of the most rural communities in the country. Last week I raised the issue of this area, which services approximately 500 households, having no main water supply. This is an important issue and I hope the Minister of State will respond positively.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising the issue of the loss of a teacher from Asdee primary school and assure <Col N="132" /> him that I will pass on his comments to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1998 was 85 pupils, which warrants a staffing for the current school year of a principal and three mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher. The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 82 pupils, which warrants a staffing for the 2000-01 school year of a principal and two mainstream class teachers. The school will continue to have the services of the shared remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The number of pupils required to retain the third mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year is 83. Accordingly, the school will lose the third mainstream class teacher at the end of the current school year. If the board of management of the school feels that the enrolment of the school for September 2000 will increase substantially it may apply for a post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criterion. The &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criterion for the 2000-01 school year is outlined in circular letter 11/2000, a copy of which was forwarded to the board of management of the school recently. To satisfy the criterion as outlined in the circular letter, the enrolment of Asdee primary school on 30 September 2000 would have to increase by at least 25 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 1999. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 107 pupils on 30 September 2000 to gain the post.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the maximum class size guidelines was outlined in circular 21/99 which issued to the board of management of the school last year. The maximum class size guidelines for the 2000-01 school year are determined by reference to the enrolment on 30 September 1999. If the board of management of the school is confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 will be in excess of 107 pupils, it should apply to the primary payments branch of the Department of Education and Science for the allocation of a teaching post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status.</P>

    <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to state what inquiries have been conducted here to date to ascertain the number and identity of patients diagnosed by Dr. Elwood, whether any such inquiries took place only as a consequence of Dr. Elwood's misdiagnoses first being identified in England, whether any inquiry into his work originated from patient concerns or concerns expressed by other medical or nursing professionals in the State, to detail any misdiagnosis identified as a result of the wrong treatment given and to state whether, as a consequence of such misdiagnosis, any patient died or any patient's life was placed at risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a statement issued today said that in a small number of cases changes were made to the prescribed treatment for specific conditions of patients after a review had been conducted of a diagnosis by Dr. Elwood. The Minister should detail how many patients have had their treatment changed and the conditions concerned. He should clarify whether any patients' conditions deteriorated as a consequence of a misdiagnosis. He should also clarify whether all patients diagnosed by Dr. Elwood have had that diagnosis reviewed fully in each of the three hospitals and whether such reviews have involved the re-examination of a patient to ensure proper patient care has been or is being provided. The Minister should also clarify whether any patient unnecessarily underwent surgery in this State as a consequence of a misdiagnosis by Dr. Elwood, as we now know occurred in England.</P>
    <P>It is essential that in this, as in all other aspects of our health service, we put patients first. I am concerned that a spokesperson for one of the health boards today stated that the health board concluded that patients whose conditions were diagnosed by Dr. Elwood need not be informed as there was a concern that patients would be unduly alarmed. If a diagnosis was correct, there is no reason why they should be alarmed. If there is any possibility that a diagnosis was incorrect, it is of crucial importance that this is brought to the attention of the patient concerned. It is time in the 21st century we moved away from the patronising &ldquo;We know best&rdquo; attitude of health bureaucracy and regarded patients as individuals with a right to be informed of any matter of direct relevance to their health and well being.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that patients who attended Tralee, Sligo or Letterkenny hospitals in recent years will be alarmed by today's reports. The Minister for Health and Children must ensure that a patient help line is immediately set up. He must assure the general public that no medical practitioner so substantially past <Col N="134" /> retirement age will in future be employed as a locum in an Irish hospital. The Minister must also provide an assurance that any person identified to date as having been misdiagnosed has already been called back or will without any delay be afforded an appointment with an appropriate consultant attached to the hospital originally attended. A guarantee must also be given that any treatment now diagnosed as required will be provided immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced today that he is establishing a working group to consider existing recruitment procedures for locum consultants. This Government finds it impossible to make any decision about the health service without first establishing a committee or working group to deliberate for an unspecified period and ultimately to produce a report which inevitably gathers dust on the shelves of the Department of Health and Children. The Minister should make two decisions.</P>

      <P>I would like to conclude if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not interrupt me.</P>
      <P>First, the Minister should instruct health boards that consultancy locum work should not be given in any of our hospitals to very elderly retired consultants in future. One English hospital has made a decision that no locum work will be given to any medical practitioner over 70 years of age. The Government should take immediate steps to establish a central register in which hospitals are compelled to detail any serious medical misdiagnosis, mistakes or incidents that occur to ensure that should a history of misdiagnosis emerge, it is detected at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter has used his five minutes. I wish to draw attention to the fact that five minutes are allocated to the Deputy and the Minister.

      <P>I do not wish to detain the House, but I wish to support the case put so eloquently by my colleague, Deputy Shatter. This is causing great concern to people in Donegal who had to visit Letterkenny General Hospital during the times when this consultant was present in 1997, 1998 and 1999. I think the consultant spent a total of eight weeks at the hospital and I hope the recommendations made by Deputy Shatter are followed, namely, that every advice, help and support possible is made available to those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second shock in the north-west. Only last year there was a problem with a laboratory which tested blood samples. To get two such <Col N="135" /> shocks within a year is unacceptable and I hope the Minister will act on the recommendations of Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to outline to the House the action which has been taken to review the pathology practice of a doctor who provided holiday cover as a locum consultant pathologist in Tralee, Letterkenny and Sligo general hospitals. The key concern in this matter must be to ensure priority is given to the rights and needs of patients. In this instance the overriding priority for my Department and the hospitals concerned was to ensure a process was put in place to review the work of the pathologist in question, to identify any problems arising from that review and to ensure the appropriate action was taken to safeguard the interests of the patients affected.</P>
      <P>The Department was contacted in September 1999 by the Southern Health Board with regard to concerns which had arisen in relation to the work of a locum consultant histopathologist who had provided holiday cover in the pathology department of Tralee General Hospital for short periods at various times from 1991 to 1999. Arising from the information which came to light it emerged that this person had also worked in a locum capacity in Sligo and Letterkenny general hospitals at various times since 1997.</P>
      <P>As soon as this information came to light, both the Southern Health Board and the North Western Health Board put in train measures to identify all work undertaken by the locum pathologist. Arrangements were also made to have the work in question prioritised and reviewed with the assistance of the faculty of pathology of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland on the basis of a standard clinical protocol in line with that used in the reviews which were undertaken in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the review it was established that the pathologist in question had provided holiday cover as a locum pathologist in Tralee General Hospital for two to four week periods on 18 occasions since 1991. He had also provided holiday cover in Sligo and Letterkenny general hospitals on six occasions for short periods totalling 14 weeks since July 1997. A total of approximately 3,000 pathology tests undertaken by the locum pathologist during his periods of employment in Tralee between 28 January 1991 and 27 June 1999 were identified. In the North Western Health Board a total of 945 tests reported on by Dr. Elwood were identified. All tests which were classified as more serious on the basis of the clinical protocol for the review have been reviewed and, in addition, due to the considerably smaller number of tests involved, a review of all the less serious tests in Sligo and Letterkenny has been completed. A review of low priority tests is currently under way in Tralee. To date, a total of 625 <Col N="136" /> tests have been reviewed in Tralee, including 268 of the most recent less serious tests.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 625 tests reviewed in Tralee, the review identified 27 tests where a disagreement with the original report was identified on review. However, in all but one case the patients were treated appropriately because the doctor treating the patient had correctly diagnosed the patient's condition. There was, therefore, one case where a change in treatment was required.</P>
    <P>Of the 945 tests reviewed in the North Western Health Board, 11 cases were identified which needed to be reviewed by the doctor treating the patient. Of these 11 cases none gave rise to significant changes in treatment other than a change of diet or minor change in medication.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the lessons of this case will not be lost and I have already put in train a range of measures to identify any further action required to ensure as far as is possible that such situations do not arise in future.</P>
    <P>While it is important to remember that the vast majority of doctors do an excellent job, the public needs to have full confidence in those who are responsible for all aspects of their medical treatment and care. I am determined to ensure appropriate measures are in place to ensure the competency of all doctors. I have, therefore, initiated a review of the Medical Practitioners Act. This review will consider proposals that recertification and re-accreditation for doctors should occur on a regular basis throughout their careers as a competency assurance measure.</P>
    <P>The issues under review in this case arose from the work of a locum consultant who was engaged to maintain services during holidays. In relation to the specific issue of locum consultants my Department is, therefore, establishing a working group which will consider existing recruitment procedures for locum consultants. I am anxious to deal with the issues raised by Deputy Shatter, particularly in relation to age. However, it is important to have the necessary consultation and to get a number of issues ironed out before we make final decisions. After all, if we made decisions I suspect Deputy Shatter would criticise the lack of consultation. The working group will have the task of making recommendations on necessary improvements, or otherwise, to these procedures. The aim is to ensure the highest standards are in place for locum consultants. We must ensure these procedures are robust and easily monitored for compliance.</P>
    <P>A primary focus on the interests of patients is evidenced by the action already taken by the Southern Health Board and the North Western Health Board to review the work of the locum consultant pathologist in question. Arrangements have been put in place by the health boards to respond to any concerns on the part of patients or their families arising from this case. In addition to the action taken by the health boards to review the work of the locum consultant pathologist, the follow-up action which I have outlined will help ensure that situations like this do not occur in the future. People have a right to expect that all who <Col N="137" /> come under the care of our hospitals receive quality care from competent staff. I want to see rapid results on the issues which arise from this case with a view to taking any necessary follow-up action as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Deputies for raising this issue.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Status of Kilkenny.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Aylward: I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter. I also thank the Ceann Comhairle who is a proud Kilkenny man, having served as Mayor on several occasions and having represented the city and county since 1961 in the House. I also thank the Minister for being here after a particularly long day, and for the willingness and speed with which he has arranged to meet a deputation from Kilkenny Corporation tomorrow night, led by the Mayor and joined by my Oireachtas colleagues. Despite the several personal political attacks on him over recent weeks, the Minister has acted with great haste, for which I thank him. I also thank him for the letter of clarification which was issued by his Department yesterday and which helped defuse much of the situation in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>This is the biggest single issue of contention since the closure of the Fieldcrest factory with a loss of 650 jobs over 20 years ago. There was shock and anger among the people of Kilkenny when news broke that the status of Kilkenny city was being downgraded, and there was a depth of feeling and resentment. Kilkenny people share a serious pride. We have excelled on the hurling field and are very proud. The outburst, which I had not seen in Kilkenny for a long time, led to over 20,000 signatures being collected, including mine and that of my colleagues from Kilkenny, expressing concern and dissatisfaction that the status of city would be in any way reduced.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny is known as a city locally, nationally and internationally. &ldquo;Ye Fair City&rdquo; appears on its coat of arms. The term &ldquo;marble city&rdquo; is used widely, while there are sporting clubs called Kilkenny City, something of which we are very proud. The city is a source of community, business, sporting and civic pride. There is a cherished link to the historical royal charter of 1609, and &ldquo;city&rdquo; has been the working title for Kilkenny for approximately 400 years. The history continued through the Confederation of Kilkenny in 1642 when it became the seat of the confederate parliament of Ireland and all the responsibilities associated with parliament were administered from Kilkenny, something of which we are also very proud.</P>
    <P>I accept that local government legislation needs to be modernised and updated. The new Local Government Bill will do this after a period of 100 years. The Minister is to be highly commended as one of the most reforming Ministers in the Department for many years. The Bill's many welcome provisions, however, have been overshadowed by the controversy in Kilkenny. While I accept the terminology used in local government legislation <Col N="138" /> needs to be updated, I wish to drive home the point that modernisation should not break links with the past. Kilkenny is not seeking county borough status but, equally, it is emphatic that there should be no interference with its current position. It must be free to continue ancient and valued traditions. I do not want to give the impression that I am comparing Kilkenny to the other four boroughs; it is unique. This should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The people of Kilkenny are a proud people. Four centuries of tradition provides an enormous local resource which should be recognised, valued and nurtured. I am sure the Minister will take local feeling into account and that we will come an arrangement when he meets the deputation tomorrow evening. A meeting of minds on both sides will ensure the matter can be dealt with in a civilised fashion. Certain amendments to sections 10 and 11 of the Bill will be proposed to preserve the status of Kilkenny as a city. The Minister is seeking to improve the democratic process but it is the wish of the people of Kilkenny that its status as a city should not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>The founder of my party and that of the Minister was awarded the freedom of Kilkenny city. When he accepted the award he commented that he was proud and honoured to be given the freedom of such an ancient and historic city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and the Chair for giving us the opportunity to discuss it. When we iron out this difficulty which is a source of major concern for the people of Kilkenny &ndash; the matter will be explained fully at the meeting tomorrow evening &ndash; perhaps, at some time in the distant future, I might join the founder of our party as a freeman of Kilkenny. The people of Kilkenny take great pride in their city. The system of local government has united them, albeit under a misapprehension. It is welcome that they have such an attachment to it.</P>
      <P>As I said on radio &ndash; again, this might have been misinterpreted by some &ndash; it was never my intention that Kilkenny would be downgraded in the local government Bill. Having spoken to him on a number of occasions in the past week to ten days, Deputy Aylward accepts this. I accept, however, that there is a depth of feeling about the matter in Kilkenny which needs to be addressed. For that reason I immediately agreed that once I received a formal request from the corporation I would facilitate a meeting, which I am delighted to say will take place tomorrow evening and at which the matter will be discussed in a less charged atmosphere than in the columns of the local newspaper or on local radio. Generally, that is not the best way to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will listen carefully to what the deputation has to say. Deputy Aylward has put a number of legal points to me which I will consider. He has made a number of very sensible suggestions regarding <Col N="139" /> the Bill which will be introduced in the autumn and which will in no way diminish the status of Kilkenny as a city. I will give careful consideration to the points which will be made at the meeting following which I am sure the matter will be resolved.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the Bill will not change the status of Kilkenny as a city. We are talking about two separate things. This status was granted under a charter which, like all other charters, is recognised in the Bill. I accept the point which has also been made by Deputy McGuinness that the relevant section is worded negatively. While this can be looked at, Kilkenny is not described as a city in local government legislation. This is accepted in Kilkenny which has been described <Col N="140" /> by me and, probably, most people in the country as a city. This will not change under the Bill. The corporation can continue to describe it as the marble city.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Aylward said we are seeking to modernise the language used in local government legislation in which Kilkenny is described as a borough. The term &ldquo;city&rdquo; has been used locally and derives from a charter granted in the early 1600s. Such local usage, custom, practice and tradition will in no way be affected by the Bill, nor have they been affected by existing legislation. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and look forward to the meeting with public representatives and the Mayor of Kilkenny tomorrow evening to clarify the matter further.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 June 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department's strategies for the development and encouragement of enterprises focuses on the continued promotion of Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment and on the further development of the indigenous sector. In 1999, IDA Ireland, in consultation with my Department, completed a fundamental review of its policies and activities. The three main priorities to be addressed by IDA Ireland in the years ahead under its new strategy are achieving significant industrial development in the Objective One regions; upgrading of the existing base of overseas companies to give them more sustainability and improve their value and quality; and beginning the real breakthrough in making Ireland an important e-business hub in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy for the further development of the <Col N="145" /> indigenous sector, which is implemented by Enterprise Ireland, aims to: increase the numbers of new fast track enterprises; get more companies exporting for the first time; increase the number of companies carrying out higher levels of research and development; drive up the numbers of companies with significant presence in overseas markets; increase investment in human resource development and facilitate the development of e-business projects.</P>
    <P>This strategy involves a stepped approach to company development which includes a detailed analysis of a company's requirements against specific goals; determining the level of need for state support; and targeting funds towards providing solutions to the real needs of client companies rather than the administration of many and diverse programmes.</P>
    <P>Financial supports to enterprise will also reflect EI's policy of switching the focus of support from capacity to capability building with a greater emphasis on human resource development skills and on research and development.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of enterprise in the regions, IDA Ireland aims to deliver half of all new green field jobs into the Objective One region in the coming years. Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will differentiate levels of support to take account of the regional development needs of the country. Enterprise Ireland will also focus in the regions on improving the business environment, the further development of existing businesses, encouraging new start ups and identifying new business opportunities. These strategies underpin the approach to enterprise development in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>I have received submissions from a number of interested individuals, representative groups and institutions about the Insurance Bill, 1999, including submissions from private insurance brokers and their representative bodies. Many of the submissions seek technical rather than substantive amendments.</P>
      <P>All the submissions are being considered in our Department at present. I expect to propose some amendments to the present text of the Bill when the Committee Stage of the Bill is taken.</P>
      <P>I remain convinced that the objectives of the Bill are sound. In particular, I am committed to the provisions concerning disclosure, including disclosure of commission. There are good reasons for compulsory disclosure of commission levels to consumers. In general, disclosure enables consumers to make an informed and rational choice of products available, thus leading to enhanced competition to the benefit of the consumer. Disclosure of commission should therefore exercise a downward pressure on the levels of commission. It should also minimise the scope for mis-selling, including churning of policies. Moreover, disclosure of commission is becoming the norm throughout the financial services sector. Under the Investment Intermediaries Act disclosure of commission is required.</P>

      <P>I published the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins, SC, made some <Col N="147" /> 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law and the administration of mergers law.</P>
      <P>Two of the 40 recommendations relate to newspapers and media and arise from the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which reported in June 1996. The review group has recommended legislative changes so as to require the Minister, when considering a merger in the media sector, to consider certain criteria identified by the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
      <P>The other recommendation relates to the issue of the acquisition of undertakings by means other than the acquisition of shares. The Competition and Mergers Review Group has recommended that the &ldquo;control test&rdquo; in the EU merger regulation be incorporated into Irish merger law.</P>
      <P>The report is a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the operation and application of all aspects of competition and mergers legislation. It has taken more than three years to compile and I do not propose to react in any detail until I have had the opportunity to fully and carefully consider all the recommendations contained in it and their implications for competition law and policy in the State.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the question refers to the new social economy programme, which is currently being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the recommendations of the Partnership 2000 Working Group's Report on the Social Economy, it was decided to introduce a dedicated social economy programme and establish a national monitoring committee representative of relevant Government Departments and the social partners. The monitoring committee has agreed the framework for the operation of <Col N="148" /> the new programme, including eligibility criteria and the local and national operating structures.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the social economy programme are to promote the emergence and consolidation of the social economy; to maximise the potential of the social economy to generate employment that is  sustainable and of high quality, subject to labour market constraints; to regenerate both urban and rural communities by providing urgently needed local services, employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market; and to promote equal opportunities between men and women. The programme will be particularly targeted at disadvantaged communities and long-term unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>Three categories of project will be funded under the social economy programme: community businesses, which are ultimately expected to be financed from trading income alone; deficient-demand social enterprises, where the demand for particular goods and services within a community is not matched by resources to pay for these due to disadvantage or low density of population; and enterprises based on public service contracts, where public services in disadvantaged areas and communities are subcontracted to local social economy enterprises.</P>
    <P>Social economy enterprises will receive grant support for up to a period of three years. These grants will include supports for employees, manager, business skills, training, capital, overheads, etc.</P>
    <P>Preparations are well advanced for the commencement of projects. Local working groups are being set up by FÁS at present to ensure the principle of partnership between statutory bodies, the social partners and local community-voluntary interests. The local working groups will oversee the operation of the social economy programme at local level, including identifying and prioritising areas of social economy activity. The working groups will advise and make recommendations to FÁS on applications for funds under the programme. Applications for funding to establish local social economy enterprises under the programme should be submitted to the local FÁS office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 55, 88 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The job initiative programme is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of JI is to progress participants into mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>The new guidelines on the future operation of the programme allow workers currently filling phase 1 places on JI, many of whom have availed of the six months extension to the end of June 2000, to remain on the programme for a further limited period to be determined locally between FÁS and their sponsors. These workers will receive personal guidance from a specific employment service case officer who will have the task of exploring the range of options available to the individual based on their ability to progress to the open labour market.</P>
      <P>As identified in the PPF, some people, including those currently on JI, may have difficulties in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market and additional long-term supports will be needed. The issue of identifying and developing appropriate supports for such persons will be addressed by the PPF standing committee on the labour market</P>
      <P>Some participants have additional training needs which can be accommodated while they remain on the programme and others may choose to opt for full time training. Bridging training programmes will also be provided by FÁS, in co-operation with the partnership companies which will be used to support the progression of JI workers. Persons engaged in full-time training will be paid the appropriate training allowance similar to other trainees and will be eligible for the £25 training bonus per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> Greater emphasis will be placed on the work experience element of the JI programme in future and through more active involvement of the local employment service, employers will be regularly appraised of the skills and competencies of JI participants. A period of placement with prospective employers may be the appropriate option for some workers and other persons currently job ready can avail of the services of FÁS jobs clubs, which are located around the country.</P>
    <P>The mainstreaming of certain essential services currently being provided by community employment participants is being pursued by my Department at present. JI workers should be eligible to compete for these positions in the same way as other unemployed persons. The mainstreaming of such &lsquo;essential services' as may be provided under JI is likely to have limited potential given the size of the programme .</P>
    <P>The proposals to mainstream essential services under community employment will be discussed with the standing committee on the labour market following which a report will be prepared for Government.</P>

      <P>I recently announced details of a new labour market immigration policy designed to meet the skills require<Col N="151" /> ments in the Irish economy over the next six years. To facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people from non-EEA countries for designated sectors of the employment market where skill shortages are particularly acute, a working visa and work authorisation scheme has been introduced. This makes it possible for prospective employees with job offers from employers in Ireland to obtain immigration and employment clearance in advance from Irish embassies and consulates.

      <P>I am satisfied the policy followed by this Government, and by all Governments since price controls were abandoned in the 1980s &ndash; that prices should be set by competition in the marketplace &ndash; continues to provide the best means of putting downward pressure on prices and ensuring value for money for consumers.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority is charged with fostering competition in all sectors of the economy and combating anti-competitive practices. The Tánaiste recently approved five additional posts for the authority &ndash; two economists and three lawyers &ndash; which will increase the authority's professional staffing level by approximately 70%. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that competition law is vigorously enforced and that competition operates to the benefit of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transparency in pricing is vital if consumers are to derive the full benefits of competition. There is extensive legislation on price displays and, last year, I made a further order requiring that drink prices be displayed immediately outside or immediately inside the entrances to public houses. As a result of this order, consumers are now given fair warning of the prices charged before they enter a premises so that they can take their custom elsewhere if they believe those prices to be unreasonably high. I recently <Col N="152" /> announced my intention to further extend consumer protection in relation to the advertising of airfares following complaints that many such advertisements do not adequately inform consumers as to the full cost of the fares advertised or their availability.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently called for an investigation into prices in the domestic services sector. I am very concerned about reports of excessive increases in certain prices in this sector and I am currently discussing with the Tánaiste the best means of addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>As I emphasised in my statement of 16 May, consumer vigilance is vital to any strategy to combat unwarranted price increases and I would strongly urge consumers to be alert to price movements, query them with the retailers concerned and take their custom elsewhere if they believe that increases are not justified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 72 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, became law on 1 April 2000. It applies &ldquo;with some exceptions&rdquo; to the generality of employees whether they be full-time, part-time, temporary or casual workers. The national minimum hourly rate of pay is £4.40, which sum must be paid, by way of a minimum hourly average rate of pay, to all experienced adult employees. Hourly rates of pay of lesser amounts than £4.40 may be paid to certain categories of employee &ndash; as, for instance, to persons under 18 years of age, to first-time job entrants or to those engaged in training or study. It is estimated &ndash; source: ESRI impact study on the NMW &ndash; that the number of employees who <Col N="153" /> will materially benefit immediately from operation of the NMW is 163,000.</P>
    <P>By Government decision of last December an additional seven inspectors were authorised for allocation to the labour inspectorate of my Department for purposes of enforcing the NMW. These additional inspectors took up their appointments in April, bringing the numerical strength of the inspectorate to 17. All 17 inspectors are engaged in NMW enforcement activity and in the enforcement of employment legislation generally. In their conduct of this work they have available to them wide-ranging powers of inspection which are laid down in the NMW Act itself and in a variety of other labour law statutes. The conditions of employment attaching to the position of labour inspector render the individual inspector liable for out-of-normal-office-hours work including night work. It is intended that some of the investigative/inspection duties to be performed by the inspectors in respect of both the NMW and other labour legislation will be carried out at night-time.</P>
    <P>The newly-appointed inspectors are still very much in the learning phase of their jobs. Their initial/formal training programme has been completed but on-the-job coaching, involving their participation in a pairing-type working arrangement with the established inspectors, will continue until mid-July. Only at that point will they commence independent inspection operations in an unassisted capacity.</P>
    <P>It had always been foreseen that new legislation as substantive and as far-ranging in its application as the NMW Act has been would give rise to understandable teething difficulties and misunderstandings as to interpretation in the early stages of the operation of the Act. For this reason the initial enforcement strategy of the labour inspectorate in respect of the NMW is characterised by an approach which, while duly checking on the compliance of employers with their obligations and responsibilities under the Act, is focused primarily on the &lsquo;education' of employers in their new obligations and on rendering all possible assistance in resolving and rectifying such misunderstandings and teething difficulties as are found to arise in individual places of employment. Plans for a more intensified, sustained and targeted enforcement exercise, focused on strict implementation &ndash; through legal action as necessary &ndash; are being finalised at present with a view to effective operation as and from July. Of course, a very important and indeed quite successful element of the initial NMW enforcement strategy was the publicity and information campaign conducted through the media &ndash; press, radio and television &ndash; in the immediate aftermath of the launch of the Act.</P>
    <P>In order to assess the effectiveness over time of the operation of the NMW Act in the achievement of its intended purposes, the Tánaiste established a special monitoring group to monitor and assess its implementation and to report its find<Col N="154" /> ings and recommendations to her in due course. This group is tripartite in its composition, its membership including representatives of ICTU, IBEC and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Its inaugural meeting takes place tomorrow, 14 June.</P>
    <P>In the period 1 April to 31 May, 245 inspections for compliance with the NMW Act were carried out by the labour inspectorate. These were concentrated in the footwear/drapery and retail/grocery sectors. A very small, almost negligible, number of infringements were identified. These infringements &ndash; all very minor in nature and the result more of misinterpretation of the legislation than of deliberate culpability on the part of the employers involved &ndash; were all rectified at the time of the inspection through the intervention of the visiting inspectors. In the same period seven written complaints alleging non-compliance by employers with NMW pay rate requirements were filed direct with the inspectorate by aggrieved employees. These are under investigation at the moment. Apart from these, some letters of inquiry, less than ten, merely seeking information in relation to applicability of the NMW in individual instances were received and responded to: these did not <i>per se</i> imply or allege non-compliance. In addition, 12,032 telephone inquiries in relation to the Act were made to the Department during April and May.</P>
    <P>A recent press report indicated preliminary figures of ICTU as revealing that 108,000 of the estimated 163,000 identified as immediate beneficiaries under the National Minimum Wage Act, still have not had their wages increased to the legal rate. When Department officials approached ICTU on this matter to seek from them such evidence as they had to substantiate this assertion and to secure whatever help or leads ICTU might be in a position to provide to assist the inspectorate in the way it might organise its NMW enforcement activities, ICTU was unable to produce any such evidence and advised the Department that the press report had misrepresented it.</P>
    <P>The number of redundancies notified to the Department in respect of the months of April and May were 1062 and 950, respectively. It is not possible to say if any of these redundancies were attributed to the operation of the NMW. In the case of one of the written inquiries referred to above the writer, an employer, indicated that he had let go 30 of his staff owing to his inability to pay them the NMW.</P>
    <P>There is no information available to the Department as to the number of employees receiving the training-related sub-minimum pay rates provided for in the National Minimum Wage Act.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, made a number of recommendations which concerned the functional responsibilities of a number of Departments. In November 1996, the then Minister presented an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations contained in the report. The Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impacted should revert to Government in relation to any necessary action. One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard.</P>
      <P>The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite significant job losses during 1999 both indigenous and inward investment companies continued to perform strongly in terms of sales and exports leading to sustained growth in employment. The total number of jobs created by agency clients during 1999 was 33,492.</P>
      <P>When total job losses of 20,590 are factored out this gives a net job gain of 12,902. Of these, 9,841 were Enterprise Ireland supported jobs, 9,162 were IDA Ireland supported jobs while 1,587 were Shannon Development supported jobs.</P>
      <P>The job losses which are occurring are mainly as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland whereby activities, and hence jobs, at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. This is a by-product of the dynamic growth of the Irish economy in terms of growth in volume and value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA's policy in this regard is, first, to focus a major part of its efforts on an embedding programme for the existing overseas owned companies in this country. The essential ingredient in this programme is to ensure that these companies continuously adapt to the changing nature of the economy. Second, IDA seeks to ensure that, as <Col N="157" /> jobs are lost in the more traditional sectors, they are more than compensated for by greater numbers of jobs in the new industries.</P>
    <P>In the indigenous sector also many of the low paid more traditional jobs lost are being replaced by jobs in the newer sectors such as software development. On an ongoing basis, Enterprise Ireland is working with existing firms with a view to addressing competitive weaknesses. Increased output now depends more on productivity growth than on labour growth. The development of human resource capabilities is of strategic importance in the development and maintenance of national competitiveness, and investment in training will help companies to achieve this. This will in turn raise living standards and ultimately enhance the competitiveness of the Irish economy while at the same time develop a high income, high productivity, high value economy based on world class skills, technology and production systems.</P>
    <P>As regards improved training opportunities for those who are losing jobs, a range of FÁS employment and training services is available to all persons made redundant. The FÁS employment service registers redundant workers and puts them in contact with employers seeking workers. Thanks to the booming economy, there is a very large number of job vacancies. In 1999, FÁS was asked to fill a record 69,750 vacancies by employers. Indications for the first months of 2000 suggest a further increase in job vacancies.</P>
    <P>The 20 FÁS training centres and contracted facilities provide over 200 different skills training courses. Most redundant workers seeking training can find a suitable FÁS option to meet their re-training needs. The vocational opportunities training scheme run by the vocational education committees is also very suitable for many redundant persons who seek to improve their educational qualifications. CERT programmes are also an option for some. FÁS enterprise training represents an opportunity for some redundant persons who feel that starting their own business, sometimes with the help of their redundancy payments, is an option.</P>
    <P>Recognising the inevitability of factory closures over the coming years in the context of the ongoing development of the Irish economy, the Government made a conscious decision in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 to ensure that FÁS was active in this area. It states: Provision will be made to assist those threatened with or affected by redundancy due to major factory closures. It is intended that provision will include relatively short training courses for persons still in employment, Job Clubs or similar interventions to help persons seek employment and start-your-own-business training.</P>

      <P>The most recent quarterly national household survey published last week by the Central Statistics Office reveals a continuation of the very positive employment and labour market trends with strong growth in employment, falling unemployment and underlying substantial growth in the labour force. However, the scale of recent labour force growth and falls in unemployment means that the labour market is inevitably tightening. It is vital, therefore, for employers to enhance productivity and retain competitiveness through continuously reviewing and upgrading the skills of their employees.</P>
      <P>Government policy is aimed at facilitating the growth of the enterprise sector through measures which aim to further mobilise labour supply and enhance the skills base. Measures to mobilise labour supply, generally, are detailed in the Government's Employment Action Plan for 2000. Measures aimed at addressing the skills needs of industry and the information technology sector in particular, were detailed in reply to a recent question from the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards the other aspects of the high technology sector, the expert group on future skills needs, in its second report, has made a number of recommendations aimed at increasing the supply of skills in chemical and biological sciences. These recommendations include the need for additional third level places and a strengthening of awareness campaigns aimed at encouraging young people to enter these fields of study.</P>

      <P>The policy on prices followed by this Government, and by all Governments since price controls were abandoned in the 1980s, is that prices should be set by competition in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>To ensure that competition operates in the marketplace, the competition authority is charged with fostering competition in all sectors of the economy and combating anti-competitive practices. The Tánaiste recently approved five additional posts for the authority &ndash; two economists and three lawyers &ndash; which will increase the authority's professional staffing level by approximately 70%. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that competition law is vigorously enforced and that competition operates to the benefit of consumers. The authority has been active in investigating allegations of anti-competitive practices in the drinks sector and have initiated legal proceedings on foot of their investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Price transparency is also essential if consumers are to be in a position to make informed decisions about purchases. On the specific question of prices in the drinks sector, I took action last year to bring greater transparency to the drinks trade: I made the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, which requires the display of a 16 item price list immedi<Col N="160" /> ately outside or immediately inside each entrance to a premises. As a result of this order, consumers are now provided with fair warning of the prices being charged before they enter a premises so that they can take their custom elsewhere if they believe those prices to be unreasonably high.</P>
    <P>The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has the power to prosecute for non-compliance with the order. My information from the director is that she has a systematic enforcement operation under way in relation to the order, and that a number of publicans have received final warnings regarding their non-compliance in advance of a final inspection to determine whether prosecutions should be initiated.</P>

Other organisations and agencies, as may also have an interest in the work of this committee, will also be invited to participate.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to progress the issue relating to CE essential services directly with relevant Government Departments initially, before reporting to the standing committee on the outcome of these discussions. Consultations between my Department and the Department of Education and Science with regard to the mainstreaming of CE schools services are already under way in this respect.</P>
      <P>Discussions and consultations on the mainstreaming of CE essential services are likely to be somewhat protracted given the various interests involved and I am unable at present to offer a completion date for the work of the standing committee. It is my intention, however, that these discussions will be brought to completion as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the references made in her annual report for 1999, to advertising on the internet and to internet banking, the Director of Consumer Affairs, Carmel Foley, pointed to these as relatively new developments. She identified one of the key challenges facing Ireland at present, and one to which she acknowledged the Government had shown its commitment and devoted much resources, as how to maximise the opportunity presented by e-commerce. Critical to this, in her assessment, was to recognise that, in whatever steps were taken, there had to be consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>I fully share the director's assessment that consumer confidence is a crucial prerequisite for the success of e-commerce. This is true for Ireland, no less than for other EU member states. Indeed, David Byrne, the Commissioner responsible for consumer protection, has identified the current mistrust of e-commerce as a transactional medium to be an important barrier to the completion of the Single On-line Market. At the last Consumer Affairs Council in April 2000, along with other Consumer Affairs Ministers in the EU, I participated in the first discussion on the Commissioner's initial thinking about a new European approach to generating consumer e-confidence. Apart from fostering best business practice, such as trustmarks, codes of conduct and chargebacks, at the heart of the strategy he envisaged was development of a range of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, mechanisms, and linking up a network of existing EU national ADR schemes through the European Extra-Judicial Network, EEJ-Net, as a first step in creating a comprehensive redress system. Disputes could be resolved by the ADR in the country of origin of the business, but consumers would have the reassurance of knowing that they could access that body from their own member state via the EEJ-Net. As a last resort, consumers could seek redress through the courts in their own member state. In Commissioner Byrne's view, a new European approach along these lines would be a balanced one, which would serve to minimise the regulatory burden on business and encourage the evolution of a service-driven Single On-Line Market benefiting consumers and business alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same April 2000 Consumer Affairs Council, ministers gave a positive political response to the Commissioner by adopting a resolution in support of creation of the EEJ-Net. The EEJ-Net was formally launched in Lisbon on 05 May 2000 by Commissioner Byrne and the <Col N="163" /> Portuguese Presidency, represented by the Secretary of State for Consumer Protection, with the participation of Antonio Vitorino, the Commissioner responsible for justice and home affairs. My Department was represented at the launch. The next stage in the process will be the creation or designation of a single, one-stop national contact point &ndash; or &ldquo;clearing house&rdquo;&ndash; in each EU member state. The clearing houses will help dissatisfied consumers with information and support in making a claim to the appropriate ADR system in the country where the business supplying the goods or services is located. Commissioner Byrne's target is to have the 15 clearing houses up and running and ready to deal with consumer complaints in the second half of 2000, if at all possible. He has promised that, within its limited means, the Commission will contribute to the set-up costs of the clearing houses. My Department is engaging in preliminary discussions with the Director of Consumer Affairs on the question of the designation of Ireland's clearing house.</P>
    <P>In its conclusions, the Lisbon European Council 23-24 March 2000, called on the Commission and the Council to consider how to promote consumer confidence in electronic commerce, in particular through alternative dispute resolutions systems. The joint Portuguese Presidency, Foreign Minister Gama, Commission and President Prodi report to the European Parliament on 11 April 2000 on the results of the Lisbon European Council identified the Consumer Affairs Council as responsible for progressing ADR and the EEJ-Net. I, therefore, expect to be actively engaged in the future in this important challenge, along with my colleagues from the other member states. Liaison with Justice and Home Affairs and Internal Market Councils may be expected.</P>
    <P>At national level, there is what I might call a horizontal measure on its way through the Oireachtas &ndash; the E-Commerce Bill, 2000 &ndash; which will have the effect of protecting consumers: The Bill provides that electronic signatures and electronic contracts will have the same legal status as written signatures and paper contracts. This means that, in the event of a dispute, electronic signatures and electronic contracts will be admissible as evidence in court proceedings. The Bill also prescribes heavy fines and jail sentences for fraud and misuse of electronic signatures. I should also mention the E-Commerce Directive, which will serve to provide additional protection for consumers when transposed into Irish law &ndash; website traders will be required to show their name, address and contact details. They will have to clearly display the price, tax and delivery costs as well.</P>
    <P>Apart from all the initiatives which I have outlined, I would advise consumers to exercise caution and use common sense when buying online. For example: deal with known reputable websites where possible, be aware of the complaints procedure applicable should there be a problem, deal <Col N="164" /> with websites that provide encryption of financial data, and avoid any site that seems to misrepresent itself, read the vendor's terms and conditions carefully to find out your rights and obligations under the contract, exercise the same caution when giving your credit card details over the Internet as you would for telephone transactions, and preferably use encrypted websites which are considerably less vulnerable to hackers than sites with no encryption.</P>

      <P>I published the Report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins SC, made some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law and the administration of mergers law.</P>
      <P>The review group, in a wide-ranging recommendation on the issue of the role of the Chairman, the Director of Competition Enforcement and a suggested procedure for dealing with competition cases, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;The Director [of Competition Enforcement] shall be an officer of, and shall be appointed by, the Competition Authority but shall not be a member of the Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report is a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the operation and application of all aspects of competition and mergers legislation. It has taken more than three years to compile and I do not propose to react in detail until I have had the opportunity to fully and carefully consider all the recommendations contained in it and their implications for competition law and policy in the State.</P>

      <P>The Competition Authority has informed me that it has conducted a number of investigations in the past three years into the retail and wholesale drinks markets. As a result of its investigations, court proceedings have been instituted by the authority alleging contraventions of the Competition Acts. In addition, the authority has referred files to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of its investigations which have covered both alcoholic beverages and soft drinks.</P>
      <P>Apart from these enforcement actions, the authority has also, on its own initiative, undertaken an independent study and analysis of the liquor licensing laws and other barriers to entry and their impact on competition and prices in the retail drinks market. The authority published its interim report in September 1998 and expects to complete its study when the legal proceedings referred to above have been concluded.</P>
      <P>Last August, my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt signed the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1999, which obliges publicans to display a price list immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to their premises. The Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for enforcing the order and is currently undertaking a campaign to ensure compliance with its terms.</P>

      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (Framework 1.3(b)(6)) the Government gave an undertaking that the Bill to implement the EU <Col N="184" /> directive on part-time work will be introduced in the Oireachtas by June 2000. A draft scheme of the Bill on part-time work is currently with the parliamentary draftsman's office. I hope to have the Bill enacted before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I have informed the European Commission formally through the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union that Ireland proposes to avail itself of the provision in Article 2.1 of the Directive under which, &ldquo;Member States may have a maximum of one more year, if necessary, to take account of special difficulties.&rdquo;. The Commission has responded to the effect that this intention has been noted.</P>
      <P>Difficulties arose during the negotiations which took place in the tripartite working group on the implementation of the directive and related, in particular, to the scope of the directive and whether non-contributory occupational pensions came within that scope. Difficulties also arose in agreeing a definition of workers who work on a casual basis who may be excluded from certain benefits on objective grounds.</P>

      <P>The Government decision of July 1999 allowed asylum seekers, who had been in the country for more than 12 months, and who were awaiting a decision on their applications, to seek employment. In conjunction with this decision I arranged to have funds made available to FÁS to set up a special unit to help eligible asylum seekers find employ<Col N="185" /> ment in Ireland. The main task of this unit is to assess the skills of the eligible asylum seekers and to match them to available jobs.</P>
      <P>The unit in Tallaght, established in April this year, has adopted a process of mediation and guidance specifically designed, using a combination of new technology software packages in conjunction with non-judgmental interview techniques. This system allows the client an opportunity to express their perceptions and ambitions with regard to work in Ireland and also to determine their skills. The system also allows the asylum seeker to test their competencies for a wide range of jobs and tries to identify those skills that can best be used in the Irish labour market.</P>
      <P>The results of the initial phase of the skills audit suggest that up to 60% of those profiled are considered job ready, with the provision of some local supports to enable them to acclimatise to working in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Some 35 persons have already been placed with employers and this process is continuing. It is intended to establish a second unit this month, based in Blanchardstown, to cater for the needs of North Dublin, North Kildare and the city centre. It is further planned to extend the service to the rest of the State starting in August 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance for young drivers is directly attributable to adverse claims experience of such drivers as a risk category. EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives, aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts, for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns.</P>
      <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The compromise package would involve a <i>droit de suite</i> levy being charged on second and subsequent sales of works of visual and plastic art conducted through the professional art market. The minimum threshold below which a member state may exempt such sales from the levy would be euro 4,000. Royalty would be payable at the following rates: 4% for the portion of the sale price up to euro 50,000; 3% for the portion of the sale price from euro 50,000.01 to euro 200,000; on 1% for the portion of the sale price from euro 200,000.01 to euro 350,000; 0.5% for the portion of the sale price from euro 350,000.01 to euro 500,000; and 0.25% for the portion of the sale price exceeding euro 500,000.</P>
      <P>Member states would also be allowed to apply a rate of 5% in lieu of the 4% rate by way of derogation, should they choose to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amounts of royalty collected under this scheme would be payable to the authors of the works concerned and, after their deaths, to persons entitled under them. The royalty would be payable to authors who are the nationals of non-EU states where such states extend like protection to EU authors. The artists' resale right is to endure for the life of the author of the work concerned and for 70 years thereafter. However, the <Col N="188" /> proposal would allow member states which do not currently apply an artists' resale right to derogate from the post mortem element of this protection for up to ten years after the compulsory transposition date of the directive. The transposition period would be up to five years from the beginning of the year following that in which the directive is adopted.</P>
    <P>My most recent information is that the compromise outlined above, which was endorsed informally at the Internal Market Council of 16 March 2000, will shortly be formally adopted as a common position of the council as an &ldquo;A&rdquo;, or non-discussion item. It will then be referred to the European Parliament for a second reading. It is hoped that the final directive will become law late in the current year or very early in the year 2001.</P>
    <P>In view of recent progress on the directive I now intend writing to my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera with a view to initiating interdepartmental consultations in the matter as soon as the easing of pressure of work connected with the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House, permits.</P>
    <P>Ireland now supports the compromise outlined above as the best available basis for agreement between member states on the future development of the <i>droit de suite</i> in the community as a whole. I should make it absolutely clear that we supported this compromise at the March Internal Market Council, and still support it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>An ESRI study on the likely impact of the national minimum wage on employment, competitiveness and inflation concluded that the effect of the minimum wage, in raising wages, would lead to some increase in consumer prices in the services sector. The study, which was commissioned prior to the introduction of the national minimum wage, estimated that the immediate impact of the national minimum wage on inflation would be 0.26%.</P>
      <P>I am aware the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, had, and is having, a significant impact on the earnings of apprentice hairdressers and, accordingly, some hairdressing salons may have chosen to increase their prices to take account of increased costs. It is a matter for each individual company to decide the prices that it charges its customers and I have no power to conduct the type of examination referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Since 1986 it has been the policy of successive Governments to promote greater competition and customer choice through, among other things, the mechanism of greater price transparency rather than through statutory price control. In relation to the hairdressing sector there is a charges display order in force which requires every person who carries on the business of hairdressing to display a notice setting out the charges for every service rendered. Complaints regarding failure to comply with any aspect of the charges display order should be brought to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs who enforces this order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide-ranging package of measures in the company law and taxation areas was approved by the Government last year, to address problems arising from the use of certain Irish registered non-resident companies, IRNR's, for undesirable purposes. The measures have now been implemented. These taxation measures were implemented in the Finance Act, 1999, and the company law measures, contained in the Com<Col N="191" /> panies (Amendment) (No 2) Act, 1999, were commenced with effect from 23 March and 18 April this year, respectively.</P>
      <P>The package of measures will ensure all companies will have to be linked more closely to the State and interface more fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the Registrar of Companies, through compliance with a range of new requirements in company and taxation law. The company law and taxation measures are designed to complement each other and provide that a strong co-operative effort on the part of the relevant revenue and company law authorities will be a feature of the ongoing implementation process. An example of this is reflected in the strike off of companies, where the registrar will have power to strike off in situations where companies fail to supply the Revenue Commissioners, with information to enable them to be registered for tax purposes and revenue furnish confirmation to this effect.</P>
      <P>Arising from a major exercise, carried out by the Revenue Commissioners which involved writing to more than 47,000 companies, seeking certain information for taxation purposes on foot of the new provisions in the Finance Act, 1999, Revenue has so far asked the Registrar of Companies to strike off 3,000 companies for failure to supply the information in question. Discussions are continuing between the registrar and the Revenue Commissioners to confirm in particular the correct identification of the companies involved.</P>
      <P>Apart from the companies notified for strike off by revenue, the registrar has separately been pursuing a proactive strike off policy for some time, in respect of companies failing to file their annual returns to the companies registration office. In 1999, 31,157 companies were stuck off the register, compared to 10,003 in 1998, while the number in the period to June of this year was 15,640 compared to 21,076 for the same period in 1999. The figures for this year include the first strike-offs under the provisions of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 amounting to some 3,341, which were struck-off last week.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, JI, is a three-year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of JI is to progress participants into mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>The new guidelines on the future operation of the programme allow workers currently filling phase 1 places on JI, many of whom have availed of the six months extension to the end of June 2000, to remain on the programme for a further limited period to be determined locally between FÁS and their sponsors. These workers will receive personal guidance from a specific employment service case officer who will have the task of exploring the range of options available to the individual based on their ability to progress to the open labour market.</P>
      <P>As identified in the PPF, some people, including those currently on JI, may have difficulties in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market and additional long-term supports will be needed. The issue of identifying and developing appropriate supports for such persons will be addressed by the PPF standing committee on the labour market.</P>
      <P>Some participants have additional training needs which can be accommodated while they remain on the programme and others may choose to opt for full time training. Bridging training programmes will also be provided by FÁS, in co-operation with the partnership companies which will be used to support the progression of JI workers. Persons engaged in full-time training will be paid the appropriate training allowance similar to other trainees and will be eligible for the £25 training bonus per week.</P>
      <P>Greater emphasis will be placed on the work experience element of the JI programme in future and through more active involvement of the local employment service, employers will be regularly appraised of the skills and competencies of JI participants. A period of placement with prospective employers may be the appropriate option for some workers and other persons currently job ready can avail of the services of FÁS jobs clubs, which are located around the country.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of certain services currently being provided by community employment participants is being pursued by my Department at present. JI workers should be eligible to compete for these positions in the same way as other unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>The proposals to mainstream certain services under community employment will be discussed with the standing committee on the labour market following which a report will be prepared for Government.</P>

      <P>The annual employment survey undertaken by Forfás indicates that in firms helped by agencies for which I am responsible, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, the number of full-time jobs created in 1999 was 33,508 compared to 21,041 in 1989. In 1999, the number of new agency assisted jobs was almost 60% higher than the level achieved in 1989. Furthermore, the excellent 1999 outturn was the best job creation outcome for the past ten years. In addition the 35 city and county enterprise boards assisted the creation of a further 4,117 full time jobs in 1999. <Col N="195" /> The city and county enterprise boards were not established in 1989.</P>
      <P>While job creation in clients of the development agencies has contributed substantially to economic growth, they are only a part of the job creation picture. Broad based economic growth has resulted in an unparalleled expansion of employment throughout the economy. The latest quarterly national household survey, QNHS, published by the Central Statistics Office indicates that the numbers in employment grew by 102,700 between the September-November quarter in 1999 and the same period in 1998. The QNHS improved the information available from the former annual labour force survey. That survey reveals that there were 1.111 million in employment in 1989 indicating that between 1989 and 1999 employment expanded by over half a million.</P>
      <P>Under the Industrial Development Acts, the development agencies can provide assistance to manufacturing or internationally traded service enterprises. However, many entrepreneurs across the country identify market opportunities and start their business independently of State agencies as they operate outside these sectors. Many of these enterprises would be in the rapidly expanding service side of the economy and consequently it is not possible to identify the number of new businesses that were set up in 1999 as many new enterprise ventures have no formal contact with the enterprise support agencies.</P>

      <P>The latest quarterly national household survey which was published by the Central Statistics Office on 7 June 2000, shows that the unemployment rate for the south-east, which includes Waterford, has declined from 7.8% recorded in the first quarter 1999 to 5.8% in the first quarter 2000. This reduction of 2 percentage points in the unemployment rate has been well ahead of the overall 1.1 percentage point reduction for the State as a whole. During the same period employment in the south-east increased by 6.2%, a similar rate of growth to the rate of jobs growth nationally. The CSO does not publish unemployment rates from the QNHS, or from the live register, on a county basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to reduction in unemployment rests with job creation. The latest data shows that there have been positive labour market developments in the south-east as a whole with growth in <Col N="196" /> employment and falls in unemployment over the 12 months to the first quarter 2000. Industrial development in particular areas of the country is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and is not one in which I have a direct function. However, the Government through its enterprise support agencies is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities. IDA Ireland's current strategy, to encourage a greater proportion of new overseas investment, particularly internationally traded services industries, to locate outside the larger urban areas namely Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, is gaining momentum and showing results in terms of the calibre of overseas companies currently looking at alternative locations within Ireland. This is being achieved by focusing on the main population centres in each region.</P>
    <P>The thrust of national policies and actions to assist the unemployed in their return to the labour market are notified in the Employment Action Plan 2000. FÁS plays a key role in supporting unemployed persons in their return to work through a wide range and scale of training and employment experience programmes. These are administered on the basis of the needs of individual regions and counties with the application of resources in particular areas of the country being a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <P>The human resource community initiative, ADAPT, has operated in Ireland between 1995 and 1999. The initiative, supported by the European Social Fund, has funded a total of 83 pilot projects during that period under the broad themes of adaptability to industrial and technological change, education, training and accreditation, partnership in the workplace, e-business and teleworking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A core objective of community initiatives, such as ADAPT, is to seek to identify and disseminate best practices and learning arising from project results. This role, in so far as ADAPT is concerned, has effectively been carried out by Léargas, the appointed technical support structure for the initiative. Much valuable material has been captured and disseminated by Léargas through the publication of products directories, thematic cluster work, publication of a study on partnership, submissions to policy making fora such as the employment action plan and the Information Society Commission's report for 1999 and the recent publication of &ldquo;Change @ <Col N="197" /> Work&rdquo; outlining the results of ADAPT in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many of the results of the ADAPT initiative have already percolated into mainstream activity and have been taken on board by the social partners who have been involved in the pilot projects both as project promoters and as project partners. The involvement of statutory agencies, such as FÁS and Enterprise Ireland, has also contributed to the incorporation of project results into ongoing training provision. I would expect that the absorption of new ideas and learning arising from ADAPT will continue to feed into the development of human resource policy. In that regard, my Department has offered a contract extension to Léargas to assist in this ongoing process and in the preparations for the implementation of the new EQUAL initiative.</P>

      <P>Community employment&ndash;CE&ndash;is an active labour market programme whose primary role is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. Following the restructuring of CE approved by Government in 1999, the following revised eligibility criteria apply to persons who wish to participate in the options available under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time integration option is aimed at persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows-widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain <Col N="198" />  approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>The eligibility age for participation in this CE option was raised from 21 years to 25 years on 1 January 2000 with the following exceptions: travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants; 18-24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
    <P>Participants remain on this programme for a period of one year. A limited number of people can remain for a second year in circumstances where it will facilitate their progression to employment.</P>
    <P>Part-time job option-rate for the job is targeted at persons who need a longer programme in order to become job ready. Participants must be 35 or over and three years unemployed and in receipt of the payments stated previously. Participants can remain on this option for a period up to three years.</P>
    <P>Other changes to the programme forming part of the restructuring process, which were introduced until April 2000, include: the duration of participant breaks between schemes increased from six to 12 months, and future participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years. An individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Offshore island residents are exempt from these changes.</P>
    <P>These changes were introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to give individuals the opportunity to undertake training programmes where possible, or to utilise the service of FÁS placement officers and-or the local employment service.</P>

    <P>I remain convinced that the objectives of the <Col N="199" /> Bill are sound. In particular, I am committed to the provisions concerning disclosure, including disclosure of commission. There are good reasons for compulsory disclosure of commission levels to consumers. In general, disclosure enables consumers to make an informed and rational choice of products available, thus leading to enhanced competition to the benefit of the consumer. Disclosure of commission should therefore exercise a downward pressure on the levels of commission. It should also minimise the scope for mis-selling, including churning of policies. Moreover, disclosure of commission is becoming the norm throughout the financial services sector. Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, disclosure of commission is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the references made in her annual report for 1999, to advertising on the Internet and to Internet banking, the Director of Consumer Affairs, Carmel Foley, pointed to these as relatively new developments. She identified one of the key challenges facing Ireland at present, and one to which she acknowledged the Government had shown its commitment and devoted much resources, as how to maximise the opportunity presented by e-commerce. Critical to this, in her assessment, was to recognise that, in whatever steps were taken, there had to be consumer confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the director's assessment that consumer confidence is a crucial prerequisite for the success of e-commerce. This is true for Ireland, no less than for other EU member states. Indeed, David Byrne, the commissioner responsible for consumer protection, has identified the current mistrust of e-commerce as a transactional medium to be an important barrier to the completion of the Single On-Line Market. At the last Consumer Affairs Council in April 2000, along with other Consumer Affairs Ministers in the EU, I participated in the first discussion on the Commissioner's initial thinking about a new European approach to generating consumer e-confidence. Apart from fostering best business practice, such as trustmarks, codes of conduct and chargebacks, at the heart of the strategy he envisaged was development of a range of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, mechanisms, and linking up a network of existing EU national ADR schemes through the European Extra-Judicial Network &ndash; EEJ-Net &ndash; as a first step in creating a compre<Col N="200" /> hensive redress system. Disputes could be resolved by the ADR in the country of origin of the business, but consumers would have the reassurance of knowing that they could access that body from their own member state via the EEJ-Net. As a last resort, consumers could seek redress through the courts in their own member state. In Commissioner Byrne's view, a new European approach along these lines would be a balanced one, which would serve to minimise the regulatory burden on business and encourage the evolution of a service-driven Single On-Line Market benefiting consumers and business alike.</P>
    <P>At the same April 2000 Consumer Affairs Council, Ministers gave a positive political response to the commissioner by adopting a resolution in support of creation of the EEJ-Net. The EEJ-Net was formally launched in Lisbon on 5 May 2000 by Commissioner Byrne and the Portuguese Presidency, represented by the Secretary of State for Consumer Protection, with the participation of Antonio Vitorino, the commissioner responsible for Justice and Home Affairs. My Department was represented at the launch. The next stage in the process will be the creation or designation of a single, one-stop national contact point, or &ldquo;clearing house&rdquo;, in each EU member state. The clearing houses will help dissatisfied consumers with information and support in making a claim to the appropriate ADR system in the country where the business supplying the goods or services is located. Commissioner Byrne's target is to have the 15 clearing houses up and running and ready to deal with consumer complaints in the second half of 2000, if at all possible. He has promised that, within its limited means, the Commission will contribute to the set-up costs of the clearing houses. My Department is engaging in preliminary discussions with the Director of Consumer Affairs on the question of the designation of Ireland's clearing house.</P>
    <P>In its conclusions, the Lisbon European Council 23-24 March 2000, called on the Commission and the Council &ldquo;to consider how to promote consumer confidence in electronic commerce, in particular through alternative dispute resolutions systems&rdquo;. The joint Portuguese Presidency &ndash; Foreign Minister Gama-Commission President Prodi &ndash; report to the European Parliament on 11 April 2000 on the results of the Lisbon European Council identified the Consumer Affairs Council as responsible for progressing ADR and the EEJ-Net. I therefore expect to be actively engaged in the future in this important challenge, along with my colleagues from the other member states. Liaison with Justice and Home Affairs and Internal Market Councils may be expected.</P>
    <P>At national level, there is what I might call a horizontal measure on its way through the Oireachtas &ndash; the E-Commerce Bill, 2000 &ndash; which will have the effect of protecting consumers: The Bill provides that electronic signatures and electronic contracts will have the same legal status as written signatures and paper contracts. This means that, in the event of a dispute, <Col N="201" /> electronic signatures and electronic contracts will be admissible as evidence in court proceedings. The Bill also prescribes heavy fines and jail sentences for fraud and misuse of electronic signatures. I should also mention the e-commerce directive, which will serve to provide additional protection for consumers when transposed into Irish law. Website traders will be required to show their name, address and contact details. They will have to clearly display the price, tax and delivery costs as well.</P>
    <P>Apart from all the initiatives which I have outlined, I would advise consumers to exercise caution and use common sense when buying online. For example, deal with known reputable websites where possible. Be aware of the complaints procedure applicable should there be a problem. Deal with websites that provide encryption of financial data, and avoid any site that seems to misrepresent itself. Read the vendor's terms and conditions carefully to find out your rights and obligations under the contract. Exercise the same caution when giving your credit card details over the Internet as you would for telephone transactions, and preferably use encrypted websites which are considerably less vulnerable to hackers than sites with no encryption.</P>

      <P>The policy on prices followed by this Government, and by all Governments since price controls were abandoned in the 1980s, is that prices should be set by competition in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>To ensure that competition operates in the marketplace, the Competition Authority is charged with fostering competition in all sectors of the economy and combating anti-competitive practices. The Tánaiste recently approved five additional posts for the authority &ndash; two economists and three lawyers &ndash; which will increase the authority's professional staffing level by approximately 70%. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that competition law is vigorously enforced and that competition operates to the benefit of consumers. The authority has been active in investigating allegations of anti-competitive practices in the drinks sector and have initiated legal proceedings on foot of their investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Price transparency is also essential if consumers are to be in a position to make informed decisions about purchases. On the specific question of prices in the drinks sector, I took action last year to bring greater transparency to the drinks trade. I made the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, which <Col N="202" /> requires the display of a 16 item price list immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to a premises. As a result of this order, consumers are now provided with fair warning of the prices being charged before they enter a premises so that they can take their custom elsewhere if they believe those prices to be unreasonably high.</P>
    <P>The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has the power to prosecute for non-compliance with the order. My information from the director is that she has a systematic enforcement operation under way in relation to the order, and that a number of publicans have received final warnings regarding their non-compliance in advance of a final inspection to determine whether prosecutions should be initiated.</P>

      <P>The Asia Pacific strategy committee was established following the Government's endorsement of the Asia strategy group report in July 1999. The committee is intended to act as a focal point in the development of foreign earnings in Asia, and it is made up of officials from relevant Departments and agencies and representatives of the private sector.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the Asia Pacific strategy committee are as follows: to oversee the implementation of the Government's Asia strategy as set out in the report of the Asia strategy group and endorsed by the Government on 21 July 1999, to establish a programme to raise awareness of Ireland with key decision makers in Asia and to monitor-oversee its implementation; and to report to the foreign earnings committee and to report to Government, annually on progress made in implementing the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee has met twice &ndash; on 27 January 2000 and 29 March 2000 &ndash; and a further meeting is scheduled for 21 June 2000. Steps have already <Col N="210" /> been taken to implement some of the key priorities of the Asia report.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to increase Ireland's diplomatic and promotional presence in the region. A new Irish embassy is opening in Singapore and new consulates general in Sydney and Shanghai have already opened. Additional resources are being deployed by the Department of Foreign Affairs to enhance its representation in Ireland House Tokyo and Ireland House Beijing.</P>
    <P>Projects designed to raise awareness of Ireland with key decision makers in Asia have been examined and approved by the committee. These include the production of promotional material &ndash; videos and brochures &ndash; in the appropriate languages for distribution in Asia, a pilot study into the development of a database of key decision makers, a forum to be held in Ireland for companies trading and investing in Asian markets and a special colour supplement in the Export Link magazine giving information on trade between Ireland and Asia. Those responsible for each project are required to implement them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At its next meeting the committee plans to review the projects already embarked upon and to consider proposals to be implemented in 2001.</P>

      <P>Preliminary figures based on CSO population and migration Estimates, April 1999, published in October 1999, suggest that the number of immigrants, other than Irish nationals, in each of the years 1997 to 1999 were 23,500, 20,800 and 21,600 respectively. Therefore in years 1998 and 1999, less than half <Col N="211" />&ndash; 47.5% and 45.5% respectively &ndash; of all immigrants were non-Irish nationals. Information is not currently available from the CSO on the contribution to employment of non-Irish immigrants in the years 1997 to 1999.</P>

      <P>The development of government to government relationships is often a key requirement in providing access to decision makers in certain target markets and also enables Ireland to make a statement of its commitment to the development of business in those marketplaces.</P>
      <P>Ministerial involvement in marketing and trade promotion activity complements the continuous work carried on by Enterprise Ireland, through its overseas office network, developing and maintaining market contact, carrying out market research and information gathering and helping Enterprise Ireland clients to internationalise their businesses.</P>
      <P>Ministerial involvement in promotional visits abroad is designed to help Irish companies achieve and increase business in selected target markets. They provide a unique opportunity for companies to gain access to key buyers, establish high-level contacts relevant to the development of their business in the market in question and supplement the continuous work carried on by companies at an individual level.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to attribute direct results to specific visits and, therefore, progress must be viewed in the context of Enterprise Ireland's overall marketing and trade promotion programme. The consolidation of commercial relationships and an increased profile for Ireland, as a competitive source of supply, are the immediate results of such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade missions are only undertaken where <Col N="212" /> there is sufficient demand from Irish companies. Companies benefit from trade missions through the consolidation of existing business relationships and the development of new ones. Participating companies are charged a fee and will only participate in the first instance if they perceive a benefit to themselves. Enterprise Ireland receives very positive client feedback, and this is one of the best indicators of the value of promotional visits to indigenous Irish industry as a market entry and development tool.</P>

      <P>As the recent Competitive Challenge and Annual Competitiveness Report 2000 publications of the National Competitiveness Council indicate, we have continued to improve our competitiveness. Both these documents have been laid in the Oireachtas Library. This improvement is reflected in the fact that Ireland now ranks seventh in this year's World Competitiveness Report compiled by the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne; this is a remarkable achievement by any score. IMD credits us with being the fastest growing of the 47 world economies surveyed this year.</P>
      <P>Our success is attributed to our attractiveness based on a well-designed incentive policy for high technology manufacturing, services and financial activities and our long-term investment in education, training and up-skilling programmes.</P>
      <P>In our case, it also underlines once more the imperative of securing a stable, predictable and moderate agreement between the social partners, as represented most recently by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That programme recognises the need to strengthen our main enterprise sectors, especially small business and the services sectors; promote indigenous industry, especially food, marine and forestry; address labour and skills shortages in both the short and long-term; accelerate the pick-up of e-commerce and use of IT throughout our economy and Government and to take up the challenge posed by the exploration and exploitation of R&amp;D in science and technology necessary to stay ahead.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that with the PPF now agreed, our cost competitiveness for both manufacturing industry and services will continue to generate both confidence and investment in our economy.</P>

      <P>The training of the workforce is principally a matter for employers. State funds are provided with the aim of augmenting expenditure by employers and, thus, increasing national competitiveness by promoting upskilling and adaptability of the workforce. Funds are also provided to upskill people outside employment and thus ensure the availability of skilled labour required to underpin the continued growth of the economy. These <Col N="214" /> resources for training and retraining are allocated within the framework of overall public expenditure priorities and in that context I am satisfied as to their adequacy.</P>

      <P>In recent years there have been two investigations undertaken in relation to insurance cost differences between Ireland and other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Deloitte &amp; Touche was commissioned to undertake an identification of the underlying causes of motor insurance costs in Ireland. In the course of that study, the consultants undertook a comparative survey of liability insurance costs in selected EU countries, based on sample quotations for small and medium-sized companies. The survey showed that on average public liability and employers liability insurance premia costs were higher in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In assessing the significance of the comparisons of liability premiums, Deloitte &amp; Touche concluded that the higher levels of expenditure on social protection by other EU countries relative to Ireland meant that, because state health and social welfare expenditures in these other countries covered more of the costs of sickness and disability arising from workplace and other personal injuries, the level of liability insurance cover required by employers in the other EU countries was less than in Ireland. Moreover, the costs of delivery of compensation in Ireland, through the legal system, were higher than in other EU countries.</P>
      <P>The special working group on a personal injuries tribunal examined personal injury compensation systems in EU and other countries for occupational injury and motor vehicle injury. I am now examining that group's final report.</P>

      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche, management consultants, were commissioned in 1996 to undertake a study on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland. Comparisons with other jurisdictions were made in respect of motor and public liability insurance. The study found that premium rates in Ireland were higher than in other EU countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that, apart from differences in compensation systems, the two major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements in Ireland were medical inflation and the high transactions cost of claims, particularly legal costs, including the cost of expert witnesses. In response to these findings, a special working group was established under the aegis of our Department. I have just received the group's final report and I am currently examining its recommendations. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report also identified improved health and safety measures in the workplace as a way of reducing costs.</P>
      <P>I would regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses and the development of a voluntary code of practice, in safe working and accident prevention as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, through a social partnership approach, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in the workplace.</P>

      <P>Concerns about the level of premia for motor insurance have caused our Department to examine the factors contributing to the relatively high level of those premia, especially as compared with premia in other EU member states. The main objective of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which I re-established in 1998, is to examine the contributory factors to the cost of insurance in Ireland and also to examine possible initiatives towards reducing premiums.</P>
      <P>It must be stressed, however, that comparison of Irish motor insurance premia with those in other EU member states is not always feasible because of different systems for providing compensation. I am examining ways of making our system more efficient. In particular, I am currently considering the recommendations of the special working group on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Finally, I am anxious to encourage as many insurers as possible to compete on the Irish market so that the Irish consumer is getting the most competitive quotes from insurers. The implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition from all European insurers, has made this possible.</P>

      <P>On the issue of safety on leisure craft, as the Deputy is aware, the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, recently presented me with its final report. This report made a number of recommendations, including some in respect to the carriage and use of lifejackets, carriage of safety equipment and consumption of alcohol. On the basis of this, I am currently proposing the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of recreational craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The Bill passed the Dáil Report and Final Stages on 24 May 2000 and the Second Stage in the Seanad on 8 June 2000. It is scheduled for debate on the Seanad Committee Stage on 13 June 2000.</P>
      <P>The Bill foresees the implementation of regulations to take account, not only of the safety of the passengers and occupants of the vessels in question but also of the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the vessels and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage.</P>
      <P>Following on the enactment of this piece of legislation, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report.</P>
      <P>I consider that these regulations, allied to the recently launched &ldquo;Year 2000 Safety on the Water&rdquo; campaign, will contribute to an increase in safety in the water based leisure sector and a resultant decrease in the emergency calls received by the emergency services in future.</P>

    <P>A full investigation into the recent capsize and sinking of the fishing vessel <i>Kylemore</i> is currently being carried out under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, by a surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department. The purpose of the investigation is to try to establish the circumstances and cause of the casualty which resulted in the tragic loss of the skipper's life, he being the sole person on board, and to see what <Col N="218" /> lessons can be learned to help avoid similar accidents occurring in the future.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the chief surveyor from the marine survey office that divers from the Naval Service have already inspected the sunken vessel on the seabed and have reported back on the condition of the vessel as well as providing video footage for use in my Department's investigation.

      <P>In the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government undertook to make progress towards the objective of as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements, consistent with the level of threat. Some progress has been made since April 1998 on the reduction of security measures, including the withdrawal of a number of battalions of the British Army and the ending of military patrols in areas of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>On 9 May 2000, a number of specific normalisation measures were announced by the Chief Constable of the RUC. These were the immediate demolition of the Cookstown base, the vacation of Fort George army base, the demolition of Cloghogue observation base in south Armagh, and the vacation of the observation posts at Broadway and Templar House in Belfast. It was also announced that, &ldquo;Subject to a continuing reduction in the level of threat, these steps would be followed within three months by demolition of the observation sangar overlooking the square in Crossmaglen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome these steps, including the intention to demolish the observation sangar overlooking the square in Crossmaglen. I also welcome the announcement by the Chief Constable on 9 May that a further review of possible normalisation steps would take place in three months time.</P>

      <P>My Department has no record of having received a 1999 beef cow headage scheme application from the person named at any time in 1999. He is not, therefore, entitled to any grants under that scheme.</P>
      <P>As the person named had submitted applications under the beef cow scheme during May of previous years he would have automatically received the 1999 beef cow scheme application form in the post by the end of April, 1999. The helpsheet for applicants, which accompanied the application form and the terms and conditions of the 1999 beef cow scheme, states that there &ldquo;is only one application period, &ndash; 4 May to 31 May &ndash; for cattle-beef cow headage&rdquo;. Clause 18 of the terms and conditions sets out details of the actual closing date of the scheme as well as the extended closing date for receipt of the application to which late application penalties apply. The closing date for receipt of applications under the 1999 beef cow scheme was extended to 4 June 1999 and notification of this extension was placed by my Department in all daily and local newspapers as well as local radio.</P>
      <P>The onus is on the applicant to submit an application form for any of the headage and premia schemes on time and there is no evidence on file to suggest that my Department advised him to submit his application under the 1999 beef cow scheme in October 1999.</P>

      <P>For many decades past, quarantine requirements have been in place for dogs and cats entering Ireland and the UK except in relation to dogs and cats travelling between both countries. The UK Government intends to dispense, with effect from 2001, with its requirement for quarantine for dogs and cats entering or re-entering the UK from member states of the European Union, the European economic area or rabies-free islands, in favour of a regime involving microchip identification, vaccination, blood testing and health certification. In the meantime, and from the end of February 2000, it has introduced a pilot of this scheme, the PETS pilot project, using certain approved carriers along a limited number of approved routes from EU member states and EFTA countries to the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will not be operating a pilot scheme and for the present the existing quarantine requirements will continue to apply for animals entering Ireland directly from outside the UK, <Col N="223" /> the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. However, in order to maintain the common control area operating between Ireland, UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, I have made a limited adjustment to Ireland's rabies legislation. This allows pet dogs and cats entering the UK from qualifying countries, to travel on to Ireland without the need for quarantine, provided they have come along routes approved under the terms of the UK PETS pilot project and have complied with all of the other conditions of that project. Such animals may originally have travelled from Ireland to any of the countries approved under the UK pilot project, or may have originated in one of those countries.</P>
    <P>Irish travellers intending to avail of the scheme will be required to have their veterinary practitioners microchip, vaccinate, blood test, and certify their dogs or cats before their departure, in the manner provided for under the terms of the UK pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>I will be maintaining close contact with my counterpart in the UK during the year in relation to the operation of the PETS pilot project and any further adjustment to our quarantine regime will be considered only in the light of the experience of this project and when further necessary consultations have been completed.</P>

      <P>The Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, provided for two separate amnesty schemes: an incentive amnesty under which, subject to compliance with specified conditions, certain liabilities to income tax and capital gains tax, together with interest and penalties, could be discharged by payment of 15% of the underlying income or gains on a confidential basis to the chief special collector established under the Act and a general amnesty under which other tax arrears had to be paid in full with remission only for interest and penalties.</P>
      <P>The figures of 7,464 and £46,856,678 to which the Deputy refers relate to an analysis carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to certain payments made under the general amnesty. The overall amount paid under the general amnesty was some £76 million.</P>
      <P>In relation to the incentive amnesty the total receipts amounted to £185.4 million from some 38,400 individuals. In mentioning a figure of over £1 billion the Deputy may have in mind the total amount of income and gains declared to the chief special collector &ndash; about £1.2 billion &ndash; to which the 15% rate applied.</P>

      <P>Funding was made available through my Department to people throughout Ireland who suffered damages as a result of flooding in early 1995 and 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, a total of £1.148 million was provided by way of a general humanitarian assistance scheme for the victims of flooding. A sum of £750,000 was provided by the Exchequer, which was supplemented by approximately £398,000 <Col N="227" /> provided by the EU. This scheme was administered by the Irish Red Cross Society on a confidential basis between that organisation and the individual applicants. Accordingly, it is not possible to distinguish between aid given for damages to homes and other losses incurred as a result of flooding.</P>
    <P>A further £750,000 was also provided that year under the humanitarian assistance-home relocation scheme for the victims of flooding in 1995 whose homes were damaged beyond economic repair or flooded for a prolonged period. Admin<Col N="228" /> istration of this letter scheme was assigned to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In 1996, almost £520,000 was provided towards a general humanitarian assistance scheme for the victims of flooding in that year; £280,000 humanitarian aid was allocated by the Exchequer with the balance of approximately £240,000 being provided by the EU. These funds were again distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society and no details are available of the division between damages to homes and other losses.</P>
    <P>Details of moneys expended to assist victims of flooding in each of the last ten years are set out in the following table:</P>

      <Quest>if he will project the likely income from the investment account of the social insurance fund over the years 2000 to 2005; the reason more of the surplus was not invested in 2000; and the way in which this investment account will interact with the new social welfare reserve fund.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The future income from the investment account of the social insurance fund will be a function of the resources that can be set aside for investment and the return that can be obtained from such investment. Both elements are subject to a considerable level of uncertainty. The resources available for investment will be determined by the interaction of the respective income and expenditure dimensions of the fund, including future budgetary decisions in relation to social insurance contribution rates and benefits; on the other hand, the rate of return will be determined by variable factors such as interest rates and the type and duration of investment which may be undertaken. Against this background, any figures for the period to 2005 that could be given at this time could, at best, only be viewed as indicative. The Deputy can be assured, however, that the objective will continue to be the generation of the optimum return to the SIF consistent with the security of the funds put aside.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1999, the estimated cumulative surplus on the SIF stood at £329 million at which point, and bearing in mind cash flow requirements, some £235 million was invested with the NTMA: the balance remained on overnight deposit with the Central Bank. Since then, in the light of continuing buoyancy of PRSI receipts, the total sum invested with the NTMA has increased to some £388 million, with the position being kept under regular review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> Although the position of the SIF and the national pensions reserve fund will not be confirmed until the now imminent legislation for the latter is enacted, it is proposed that the two funds will remain separate entities, as the SIF will be required to meet pension and other social insurance liabilities in the shorter term, whereas the intention is that the reserve fund should assist with the funding of pensions over the longer term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 483 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act provides a relief from income tax or corporation tax in respect of gifts of money accepted by the Minister for Finance for use by the Minister for any purpose for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided. Public moneys is defined in the legislation as moneys charged on or issued out of the Central Fund or provided by the Oireachtas. The section was first enacted as section 64 of the 1965 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>I understand that, to date, nine applications for the purposes of section 483 have been accepted by Ministers for Finance and that 15 have been rejected. It would seem that three other applications were made but did not go ahead.</P>
      <P>Gifts donated under this section have been accepted for general Exchequer purposes. Gifts have also been accepted for specific purposes including the restoration of national monuments.</P>
      <P>Gifts of pensions by persons while in receipt of other income from the State have been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware, from my statement on 23 May, that Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, who has been nominated by Ireland for appointment as a Vice-President of the European Investment Bank, has informed me that it is his intention, on <Col N="231" /> his appointment, to forego his judicial pension for the duration of his period in the bank.</P>
    <P>Tax relief is given on a gift by deducting the amount of the gift from the individual's total income before calculating the tax due. If the gift consisted of the return of a state pension, the individual's chargeable income for the tax year, including the pension, would be reduced by the amount of the gift. In effect, from an income tax point of view, the person would be in the same position as if they had not received the income.</P>
    <P>In the case of a company, the gift is treated as a loss in a separate trade which means that the amount can be set against the company's income from all sources in the particular accounting year or in the previous accounting year.</P>
    <P>Applications for tax relief under this section are decided on their individual merits. However, in considering a particular application I would need to be conscious of the cost of granting tax relief and the possible implications for public expenditure of accepting a donation.</P>
    <P>The section has applied for a significant number of years. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information provided in this reply in relation to the number of applications. If further information on the number of past applications comes to light, it will be made available to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 153 and 154 together, as they deal with essentially the same issue.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the numbers of C2s issued in the calendar year 1999 was 28,366 and the number issued in the period from 1 January 2000 to 28 April 2000 was 22,691. The C2, which enables a subcontractor to receive payments from principal contractors under a contract of self employment without deduction of relevant contracts tax is generally issued at the beginning of the tax year. Accordingly, even though C2s are issued throughout the year, the majority of C2s that will be issued for the tax year 2000-01 would have been issued by 28 April 2000. RCT applies to the construction, forestry and meat processing industries. A record of the number of C2s which apply to the different industries is not readily available but I am informed that the majority of C2s issued would apply to the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The form RCT 1 is a declaration completed jointly by a principal contractor and a sub-contractor who are about to enter into a relevant contract, as defined in section 530 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. A relevant contract, in the case of the building industry, is a contract to perform certain construction operations, not being a contract of employment. The RCT 1 applies also in the meat processing and forestry industries.</P>
      <P>The form was introduced in 1996, in accordance with a recommendation of the black economy monitoring group. On the form, the principal and sub-contractor declare that, having regard to the guidelines published by the Revenue Commissioners as to the distinctions between contacts of employment and relevant contracts, they have satisfied themselves that, in their opinion, the contract which they propose to enter into is not a contract of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that a record of the number of forms RCT 1 issued is not maintained. The forms are available in tax offices and are issued in response to requests from principal contractors for a stock of the forms. A principal contractor would normally maintain a stock of the forms and all the forms issued would not necessarily be used. Accordingly, it is felt that maintaining a record of the number of the forms issued would not provide any meaningful information to Rev<Col N="233" /> enue. The number of the forms that were printed is as follows:</P>
    <P>Year 1999:52,000</P>
    <P>Year 2000 to date:81,700</P>
    <P>The form IT 25 is an information leaflet which has been produced by the Revenue Commissioners to provide guidance to employers as to the distinctions between employment and self-employment status in the construction industry. It contains essentially the same guidelines as are contained on the form RCT 1 and explains the tax and PRSI implications, depending on the nature of the contract.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a review of the correct categorisation of payments made to contractors is a feature of all Revenue audits. Depending on the nature of the business and an assessment of the tax at risk in a particular business, the question of employment versus self-employment will be given particular attention in certain cases by Revenue auditors. In the case of audits of principal contractors in the industries in which RCT applies, the use of the RCT 1 is monitored.</P>
    <P>During 1997 and 1998 a special campaign was undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that employees in the construction industry were correctly categorised as employees and that PAYE-PRSI was applied to payments made to them. I am assured by the commissioners that if they become aware that employers in this industry or indeed in any other industry are incorrectly classifying employees as self-employed they will not hesitate to take appropriate action in relation to that industry.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the South Eastern Health Board and have been advised that arising from the recent increase in medical admissions to Waterford Regional Hospital, the majority of which are older people, an additional 18 bed medical unit has been opened at the hospital. The board has a number of priorities for 2000 in relation to services for older people in the Waterford area. These include, the upgrading of St. Joseph's hospital, Dungarvan, through the commissioning of St. Enda's ward, which has recently been completed. In addition a number of other projects are proposed, including completing the refurbishment and upgrading of St. Malachy's ward, St. Patrick's hospital, Waterford, in conjunction with the Friends of St. Patrick's; development of additional services for carers including day care and respite care and home support services; strengthening multidisciplinary teams through the appointment of additional posts of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists; and the further development of existing inpatient services reflecting both increased care dependency and increasing specialist and support care needs in sub-acute and long-stay care by further developing access to para-medical services and additional staffing.</P>

      <Quest>if he will respond to suggestions that he should defer the introduction of a ban on the advertising of tobacco in newspapers until a similar ban comes into effect in the UK in view of the unique overspill of UK newspapers into the Republic and the claimed possible distortions of the internal tobacco sales market as a consequence; and if he will estimate the likely savings to health service providers and the State if smoking related illnesses were eliminated.</Quest>

      <P>Tobacco advertising plays an important role in promoting tobacco products particularly in relation to young people. I have advised the tobacco industry here that no further advertising or sponsorship, other than limited retail and trade advertising, will be allowed after 1 July this year. This is in line with an EU directive banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship adopted in July of 1998. With regard to an overspill of UK newspapers here, I am currently considering proposals to restrict or prohibit, if necessary, the importation for sale of newspapers, magazines or publications containing tobacco advertising.</P>
      <P>My concerns in this area are the promotion and protection of public health and children and the elimination of childhood addiction to tobacco. Tobacco related illnesses kill half of those who use tobacco. I see no reason to defer the introduction of the measure as announced.</P>
      <P>There are a number of diseases such as lung cancer, emphysema and heart disease associated with tobacco consumption. However, tobacco consumption is not always the causative factor in every case. Therefore, data in relation to expenditure incurred specifically in treating tobacco related diseases cannot be accurately computed. However, it is estimated that smoking related illnesses account for about 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland and much avoidable morbidity so one can see the savings in human terms which would accrue if such illnesseses were eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nurse staffing difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the level of applicants for nursing posts outside the Dublin area far exceeds the number of positions available. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialities over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuate accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
      <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it.</P>
      <P>New arrangements have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad. A significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units has been introduced. Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions. Some 11 hospitals around the country provided &lsquo;back to nursing' courses in 1999 for nurses wishing to return to the workforce. A total of 304 places were available. The expansion of these courses is aimed at maximising the available nursing workforce. During 1999-2000 16 new post-registration programmes have been developed. This year there will be 660 places on post-registration courses in specialised areas of clinical practice. In response to an identified need, 11 of the 16 new programmes will be located outside the Dublin area. An anti-bullying policy document, prepared by the HSEA and agreed with the nursing unions, and was published in December 1999 and has been widely promoted within the service. The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1,250 clinical nurse-midwife specialist positions are being introduced for nurses who <Col N="237" /> have recognised expertise in particular areas. These posts attract clinical nurse manager two salary. Nurses are also benefiting from an agreement to upgrade 1,100 staff nurse posts to clinical nurse manager one grade which is being implemented at present.</P>
    <P>A study of the nursing and midwifery resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. Following on from this, a national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the Health Research Board and awarded to the department of nursing studies, University College Cork.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicates that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here. Employers have stepped-up their recruitment from abroad with significant success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, for example, in addition to on going recruitment within Ireland.</P>
    <P>Swift progress is being made on the implementation of the agenda for change mapped out by the Commission on Nursing. A priority action plan was agreed with the nursing alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. Additional funding of £10 million has been provided this year for initiatives in the action plan.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the Commission on Nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the nursing alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. These issues are being addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in the public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005.</P>
    <P>Further funding totalling £400,000 was made available to the various schools of nursing throughout the country late last year to enable them undertake local marketing campaigns aimed at promoting nursing as a career.</P>
    <P>This year there were more than three applicants for every available training place. This is <Col N="238" /> most encouraging bearing in mind that the total number of training places is being increased by 25% over last year to 1,500 and the reduction in the volume of applicants for public service positions generally.</P>
    <P>The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, has been increased to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify. In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms have also been increased.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a matter for its board of management. In April 2000 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children published its report on single site testing of blood products which I have studied in detail. The joint committee considered that the import of the presentations made to it might be that the security, backup and synergy provided through enhancing the present two site testing arrangements seem significantly superior to relying on a new and as yet unproven centre for all the country's blood testing facilities. The report also refers to the need to ensure optimal patient care in accordance with international practice and to optimise resources to the maximum possible degree. It also refers to the risk of contamination of centralised laboratories and of closure due to industrial problems.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board's preliminary consideration of the report took place at its meetings on 10 May and 7 June and detailed consideration of the report is now taking place. I expect to meet the board as soon as it completes its consideration of the report. I also understand that the joint committee has recently met a representative of the board concerning the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee's report also refers to contention between two of the IBTS centres. I have also been informed by the board that its objective is to develop a national cohesive organisation which meets the needs of the hospital services effectively and efficiently. This objective is based on the need to address weaknesses identified in a number of reports including the report of the expert group on the BTSB, the Bain report and the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB, Finlay report. Staff of the IBTS are currently located at three centres, namely Dublin, <Col N="240" /> Cork and Limerick. Additional staff will be located at two new mobile blood collection centres which are being established in Carlow and Ardee, County Louth. The board has recently reviewed progress to date in achieving this key objective and considers that further action is now required given the establishment of two additional mobile centres.</P>
    <P>The board fully recognises the importance of the participation of staff in the ongoing development of the organisation and in improving services to hospitals throughout the country. A consultative process has commenced which is being managed on a collaborative basis involving staff on a functional, such as medical, technical, nursing and donor services, rather than on a traditional geographic basis. The board considers that all staff should fully engage in this process in the interests of the organisation as a whole. The board is also developing a revised committee-team structure which will ensure appropriate and ongoing involvement of staff in the planning and implementation of board policy. The board will review the implementation of this initiative on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I remain concerned about the ongoing tension within the IBTS. I have raised this matter with the board and I believe that there is a strong obligation on all concerned to resolve outstanding issues that have given rise to this tension.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent speech by a person (details supplied) at a conference in Cork on inequalities in health when he stated that class still governs health, and that, despite the strength in our economy, there is evidence that the situation whereby twice as many men in the unskilled group suffer from chronic illness and where the mortality rate among people from an unskilled background is 50% higher than those from a professional background.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the paper delivered by Professor Brian Nolan of the Economic and Social Research Institute at the Southern Health Board conference on health inequalities in Cork on Friday, 26 May 2000. International research has found that there are large differentials in mortality and morbidity between the higher and lower socio-economic groups and the conclusions from this research are that health inequalities are primarily a consequence of material differences in living standards. As Professor Nolan stated, the fact that there are differences across occupations, occupational groups and social class in death rates for men has been known for many years. Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. Inter-sectoral <Col N="241" /> collaboration is required to tackle these problems.</P>
      <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy was published in 1997 and set out a programme to reduce poverty and social exclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas. Although health or health targets were not included in the original NAPS targets, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual work plans for NAPS. The new partnership agreement, Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, contains a commitment to update the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and review the underlying methodology, existing targets and consider new targets such as health. My Department is already engaged in establishing the necessary structures to support a wide-ranging consultation process and a working group on health. The objective is to produce an agreed final report which will identify potential health targets, health inequalities and associated outcomes including policy measures and performance indicators. As I stated at the health inequalities conference, I am committed to working in an open and constructive manner to develop a health related dimension to the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>The poverty proofing of policies will be independently reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council with a view to strengthening that process. Following this review, poverty proofing will be extended on a phased basis to local authorities and health boards.</P>
      <P>The overall budget for health services for 2000 excluding capital is almost £4 billion. This represents a substantial increase of just over one-third over the past two years and is a clear recognition of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality health service directed at those most in need.</P>
      <P>The £2 billion earmarked in the NDP for health capital for the seven year period 2000-06 represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. This investment will provide a physical infra-structure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will be a significant ingredient in improving the mortality and morbidity of the poorest groups in our society.</P>
      <P>The ability of a society to create and maintain an environment which supports its people in attaining the highest level of health compatible with their natural endowment is one of the key indicators of the stage of development of a society and is recognised as such by its inclusion in the UN's list of human development indicators. Much work has already been done in Ireland on a multi-sectoral approach to poverty and social inclusion. It is essential that we continue to build and improve on the framework in place in the context of revised NAPS targets, NDP funding, and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I recently announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward <Col N="243" /> opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid for a number of weeks to come as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled.</P>
    <P>With regard to the decision of the Medical Council to introduce an examination for non-EU nationals entering the health services here, I would like to state firstly that the Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Its functions include registering all medical practitioners in this country, fitness to practice and ensuring that junior doctors working in our health service have received a very high standard of training and education. Its membership is made up largely of medical professionals. It is also important to note the Medical Council here works independently from the General Medical Council in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland. Overseas doctors, EU and non-EU, account for about a third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. These doctors have played and I am sure will continue to play a very important role in providing a quality service in our hospitals. This assessment procedure was introduced by the Medical Council to ensure that all medical trainees, both EU and non-EU nationals, are of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is addressing the issue of medical staffing in hospitals. The forum will issue its first report shortly and its recommendations will address this issue.</P>
    <P>In the event that some junior doctor posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. I am confident that with full co-operation from all concerned, and a degree of imagination in making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>

      <P>A new conjugate vaccine to protect against group C meningococcal disease, which represents about 40% of the disease in Ireland, is expected to become available later this year and planning is under way for its introduction into the primary childhood immunisation programme and for it to be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparations for the introduction of the new vaccine the meningococcal reference laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street is undertaking a study to establish the sub-strains of group C meningococcal disease currently circulating in Ireland. This will enable an analysis to be carried out after the vaccine has been introduced to establish its effect on the sub-strains of the disease in circulation.</P>
      <P>The working group on bacterial meningitis, which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer and which published reports in 1997 and 1999, includes among its members a range of medical experts who are closely involved in dealing with meningococcal disease in Ireland. The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research at national and international level, so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
      <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>

      <P>The issue of HIV/AIDS continues to be of con<Col N="246" /> cern. Even though new effective treatments are reducing the number of people who develop AIDS, new cases of HIV infection continue to be reported. At the end of December 1999 there were 2,195 reported cases of HIV, with 209 of these cases being reported in 1999.</P>
      <P>As part of a comprehensive review of national AIDS strategy which was conducted by the national AIDS strategy committee, NASC, and which will be launched later this month, the provision of consultant services to address the treatment and management of people with HIV/AIDS was examined by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the body which approves the number of consultants required throughout the country. The recommendations of the Comhairle have been endorsed by the national AIDS strategy committee.</P>
      <P>Comhairle has recommended the establishment of some additional consultant posts to cater for HIV/AIDS service needs. It has advised, however, that in the context of the broader area of sexually transmitted infections and other infectious diseases that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should give early consideration to the matter. Further work is required on the nature and extent of such other infections and on how best health boards may enhance or develop health services to cater for patient needs. We must await the outcome of further examination of the situation and discussions with Comhairle na nOspidéal on the matter before decisions are made on the recruitment of additional viral or infectious diseases consultants.</P>

      <P>Dioxins are mainly by-products of industrial processes and are found in air, soil, water, sediment and food. I am advised that most human exposure to dioxins is through the food chain and protecting the food supply is most important in safeguarding public health from dioxins. The World Health Organisation through its European Centre for Environment and Health in the Netherlands conducts periodic studies mainly in European countries to provide an assessment of human exposure to dioxins. Data on exposure show that measures introduced to control dioxin release in a number of countries have resulted in substantial reductions in exposure to these compounds over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As dioxin compounds can be stored in the body, primarily in fatty tissues, cows' milk is often taken as a sensitive indicator of the level of contamination in the human food chain. The Environmental Protection Agency here has conducted a study of cows' milk and have found levels of dioxin to be uniformly low and much lower <Col N="248" /> than levels measured in other European countries. This survey will be repeated this year to provide up to date measurements. I have no plans to establish a database on the levels of dioxin chemicals in the population.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he will take to deal with a chronic shortage of anaesthetists in the north east which has threatened all surgery in a number of hospitals and the closure of an intensive care unit.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of hospital services in the North Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance. However, I understand from the North Eastern Health Board that it has a full complement of consultant anaesthetic staff. The board is exploring all possibilities with a view to having a full complement of staff from July 1 next.</P>
      <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid for a number of weeks to come as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled.</P>
      <P>With regard to the decision of the Medical Council to introduce an examination for non-EU nationals entering the health services here I would like to state that the Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Its functions include registering all medical practitioners in this country, fitness to practice and ensuring that junior doctors working in our health service have received a very high standard of training and education. Its membership is made up largely of medical professionals. It is also important to note the Medical Council here works independently of the General Medical Council in Britain.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland. Overseas doctors, EU and non-EU, account for about a third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. These doctors have played and I am sure will continue to play a very important role in providing a quality service in our hospitals. This assessment procedure was introduced by the Medical Council to ensure that all medical trainees, both EU and non-EU nationals, are of the highest standard.</P>
      <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is addressing the issue of medical staffing in hospitals. The forum will issue its first report shortly and its recommendations will address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> In the event that some junior doctor posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not effected. I am confident that with full co-operation from all concerned, and a degree of imagination in making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>

      <P>Despite evidence of undernotification, an examination of recent epidemiological data in Ireland indicates a low prevalence of hepatitis B, in line with other northern European countries. Immunisation is, therefore, recommended only for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their occupation, lifestyle or other factors, for example, close contact with a case or carrier. The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians will continue to review the policy on hepatitis B immunisation in the light of changing epidemiological data.</P>
      <P>A recent national study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in the population indicated that Ireland has a very low endemicity for hepatitis B&ndash; approximately one in 200 of the population, which is much lower than that found in other low endemicity northern European countries. The authors of the study concluded that the current national hepatitis B immunisation policy, that is, selective immunisation of high risk individuals, is appropriate at present and recommend that it continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 to 184, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department works closely with a range of statutory and voluntary groups to ensure that people have the information and the support to make healthy lifestyle choices. The unit supports an extensive range of initiatives organised by the Irish Cancer Society, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers including melanomas.</P>
      <P>This support enables the society to organise a &ldquo;Sunsmart Campaign&rdquo; each year the objectives of which are: to increase awareness of skin cancer risk factors; to encourage people who are high risk to avoid excessive exposure to the sun and to avoid the use of sunbeds; and to adopt appropriate sun protection for themselves and their families and to promote early detection of skin cancer.</P>
      <P>The society's current campaign is aimed specifically at young children, the central message being &ldquo;Take Care Of Your Child's Skin In The Sun&rdquo;. This objective will be achieved by continuing to work through partnerships in the key settings of schools, the health services, the workplace and the community.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department also produces a range of information materials in relation to the dangers of the sun and the precautions to be taken when going abroad on sun holidays.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation banning the use of sunbeds. Existing consumer legislation sets standards for tanning equipment and requires appropriate warning notices to be displayed on the equipment.</P>
      <P>The advice given by my Department is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their family doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by children under 18, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions is, as I said, available to the public from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds in beauty salons were drawn up by the Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the fact that cancer is the <Col N="251" /> second biggest cause of deaths in Ireland after cardiovascular disease, there has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer over the last number of years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996 and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
    <P>Regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area.</P>
    <P>The main areas of development include consultant appointments and on a national basis, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services. My Department will continue to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>The two UK-based medical defence organisations, which operate in Ireland, have always offered the same level of cover to their UK and Irish workers. However, for many years they have charged different levels of subscriptions to reflect the relative costs of meeting claims in the two jurisdictions. One of the defence bodies has recently entered into an arrangement with a commercial insurance company to provide insurance cover to its UK workers. The level of cover available to Irish workers remains unchanged and is at least equal to, if not better than, that available to UK doctors.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting <Col N="252" /> the costs of nursing home care. It was not intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by the Government in recent years. For example, more than £5 million in additional funding has been allocated this year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope for effecting further improvements to the terms of the scheme. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's guidelines for the reporting of child abuse concerns are contained in Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children. Children First emphasises that all allegations or suspicions of child abuse should be reported to the statutory authorities without delay. The statutory authorities for receipt of these reports are the health boards and the Garda Síochána. A report may be made in person, by phone or in writing. Upon receipt of a suspected child abuse report, a health board carries out an initial assessment and the welfare of the child is always of paramount importance. The initial assessment considers the following: the nature and degree of any child abuse indicated in the report; the potential and current impact of suspected abuse on each child in the family; the need to take immediate protective action; the necessity to confer with professionals and agencies who may be involved already with the child and family; the need to formally notify the child care manager-designate of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children First emphasises that all organisations providing services to children should have clear written procedures on the action to be taken if allegations of abuse against employees are received including the reporting of allegations to the health board without delay. It is stressed that employers have a dual responsibility in respect of both the child and the employee. Allegations of abuse against employees may lead to disciplinary action and any action taken should be guided by <Col N="259" /> agreed procedures, the applicable employment contract and the rules of natural justice. It is recommended that when possible the same person should not have responsibility for dealing with both the reporting issues and the employment issues.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Deputy may have a particular case in mind which involves adult victims of alleged child abuse. In that particular case, the health board assessed the current situation and considered that no child was currently at risk. It then asked the organisation involved to conduct an inquiry into the practices which led to the reports made. This inquiry was conducted under the supervision of the child care manager for that area. If the Deputy wishes to obtain further clarification, he should contact the relevant child executive officer of the health board concerned.</P>

It is known however that there are approximately 100 such patients in acute hospital beds awaiting appropriate placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of policy is to provide special units for the young chronic sick, young chronic disabled. At least eight such units, to cater for 200 people, are required and provision for this is built into the national development plan in the period 2000 to 2006. One new unit, with 25 places, in Peamount Hospital in Dublin has been provided <Col N="260" /> within the last 12 months and will be fully occupied within the next few months. In the absence of specialised units, health boards place the young chronic sick in other facilities, such as community hospitals and nursing homes where this is possible in individual cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 205, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer in recent years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996, and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997, considerable improvements have taken place in this area. The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are: to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with two co-regional directors of cancer services appointed in the North Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. The main areas of development included that of consultant appointments and in this context the Mid-Western Health Board have had additional appointments made in medical oncology, haematology and palliative care. On a national basis, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services. Dedicated funding for the development of cancer services has been allocated to the mid-west and since the launch of the strategy this has amounted to some £3.701 million. The pilot cervical screening programme is due to commence shortly and is being piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Forum has recently presented me with a draft copy of its report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. I am reviewing this report. My Department is continuing to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

    <P>The Irish health care system is structured to ensure that a high quality health care system is available to people based on need rather than ability to pay. This commitment to the principle of equity was reinforced in the national health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future. In the context of this underlying principle of equity, it is considered that public funds can be utilised to best effect where those who have the means to do so fund their own care or contribute to the cost of that care.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded, if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the criteria for a medical card relate to hardship and there is no implication in the Health Act, 1970 that the number of people with a medical card should be maintained at a given percentage of the population.</P>

      <P>For operational reasons it is normal practice that when new units are completed under major developments such as have taken place under phases I and II of the redevelopment of Limerick Regional Hospital, they are commissioned on a <Col N="264" /> phased basis. In 1998, £0.550 million was provided by my Department to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of the commissioning of the new units which were completed in Limerick Regional Hospital and an additional £2.5 million and £4.15 million was provided for this purpose in 1999 and 2000 respectively. This funding has enabled the commissioning to date of a number of units at the hospital, including the accident and emergency department, out-patients department, paediatric unit, laboratory and physiotherapy departments, main operating theatres, day, trauma and eye theatres, intensive care unit beds, renal dialysis stations, radiology rooms and CSSD.</P>
      <P>Further commissioning is provided for in the Mid-Western Health Board's 2000 service plan, including the opening of the medical day unit and additional theatres.</P>

      <P>Queries regarding payments made by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board to community pharmacists arise, in the main, from over deduction of £42 from individuals in the same family. This situation has arisen due to the transitional arrangements put in place when the drug payment scheme was introduced on 1 July 1999. Under these arrangements patients could continue using their drug cost subsidisation scheme numbers pending the issue of drug payment scheme swipe cards. The introduction of the necessary information technology to facilitate the sole use of drug payment scheme numbers will considerably reduce queries in this regard. In the meantime queries from community pharmacists to the General Medical Services (Payments) Board are being dealt with as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made towards resolving the difficulties which the board has experienced in its efforts to significantly increase the numbers of pharmacies who submit claims electronically to the board and it is expected that over the coming months demands by pharmacists for this facility will escalate. The board has recently introduced an early payment for contractors who submit both general medical services and drug payment scheme claims electronically to the board within three working days of the end of a month &ndash; qualified claimants will be paid within 14 working days of the end of the month <Col N="265" /> of the claim, that is one month early in the case of GMS claims and two to three weeks early in the case of drug payment scheme claims. A recent check carried out by the board in April on claims submitted in March by a number of pharmacies who met the criteria showed that these pharmacies received their payments on 19 April.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contacts regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are ongoing with all interested parties involved with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulance in the overall context of pre-hospital care. I am continuing to provide additional funding for pre-hospital care with funding of over £10 million in 2000. This is the <Col N="266" /> largest annual amount ever provided for the ambulance service.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the Report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service in 1993, approximately £33 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This has resulted in major improvements in the service including the training of ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service falls to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources.</P>

      <P>Information on drug related deaths is collected by the Central Statistics Office for the general mortality register in accordance with guidelines developed by the World Health Organisation using international classification of diseases code 9, which includes deaths due to drug dependence and poisoning by opiates and other narcotics. In the past few years there has been ongoing discussion between the drugs misuse division of the Health Research Board, the Central Statistics Office and other relevant actors, and efforts have been made to improve the reliability of reports of drug related deaths. These deaths are based on death certificates which often give the main cause of death as a medical condition other than drug use, although drug use may have been implicated in the death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drugs misuse research division is also working with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction to apply a new drug related deaths standard definition which would include deaths from causes such as road traffic accidents where drug misuse was involved. <Col N="267" /> The intention would be that this standard definition would be applied across EU member states and thus allow for the comparison of data. In addition, arising from a workshop which was held last August to discuss this issue, I believe discussions are under way on the possibility of establishing a special register to record drug related deaths in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Figures requested by the Deputy &ndash; applying the ICD 9 definition &ndash; are as follows:&ndash;</P>

    <P>These figures should be regarded as provisional at this stage, particularly the 1999 figure as further validation may still need to be carried out.</P>
    <P>We also know that between April and the end of May 2000 the ERHA received notifications of 19 heroin related deaths from the City and County Coroner's Office. This information was received in the context of the ERHA's investigation into deaths of heroin misusers with evidence of severe inflammatory process. We are uncertain, however whether these cases fit into the ICD 9 definition.</P>

      <P>Children are assessed for the provision of orthodontic treatment at national school and those requiring treatment are placed on waiting lists according to the severity of their condition. It is imperative that their teeth are fully erupted before assessment can be fully completed and, as necessary, treatment commenced. Full eruption of the teeth is usually completed in or about the 12th year. While orthodontic treatment can be given at any age with a successful clinical outcome, the objective is to provide treatment as soon as possible after assessment.</P>

      <P>I have been advised that the person referred to by the Deputy has had extensive discussions with a medical officer at the Irish Blood Transfusion Service concerning the reason she was temporarily deferred at a recent blood donation clinic. All donations of the person in question have been tested in line with international standards and have tested ELISA negative for hepatitis C antibodies. The ELISA test is a very sensitive automated test which is in use by transfusion centres internationally. The only time it may miss a donor infected with hepatitis C is in the window period during the early phase of infection, before the individual has produced antibodies to hepatitis C, that is, 90 days after exposure. As the person in question received anti-D in 1977, the window period of possible exposure has well passed.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, infected anti-D was manufactured in 1977 and 1978. In the case of blood donors who received anti-D in those years the IBTS is routinely conducting a PCR test on blood samples of such donors as a further precautionary measure. PCR testing is aimed at detecting the presence of a virus during the window period. Pending the results of a PCR test, such donors are temporarily deferred. When the person in question attended a recent donor clinic she completed a revised donor questionnaire form which contained a question concerning the administration of anti-D in 1977 or 1978. As she received anti-D in 1977, a temporary deferral code was placed on her donation record and a blood sample for PCR testing was taken at the clinic. The IBTS has confirmed that she was not exposed to infectious Anti-D in 1977 and it is awaiting the PCR results before reinstating her as a donor. This donor has repeatedly tested ELISA negative and I am advised that there is no medical reason to question the accuracy of the ELISA test results.</P>

      <P>The recently published report of the European Commission on bathing water quality in 1999 indicates significant improvements in bathing water quality in Ireland over the 1998 bathing season.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of bathing water quality is undertaken by local authorities in accordance with national regulations implementing the European Council directive on quality of bathing waters (76/160/EEC). An annual report on the quality of bathing water in Ireland is prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency using the results of such monitoring. An EU-wide composite report is published annually by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The European Commission composite report on &ldquo;The Quality of Bathing Water&rdquo; for the 1999 bathing season was issued in May 2000 and indicates that 98.3% of Irish bathing sites complied with the mandatory values laid down in the directive, with a compliance rate of 100% in inland sites. The percentage complying with the more strict guide values rose sharply from 80.2% to 89.2% in 1999. These are very impressive and encouraging results and are among the best across the European Union.</P>
      <P>The monitoring results on the quality of bathing waters are taken into account as part of the assessment criteria for the award of blue flags for beaches. These assessment criteria include a wide range of other matters including, for example, public information notices, environmental education activities, ease of access, provision of litter bins, first aid and public toilet facilities. I have no function in the awarding of blue flags to beaches or the determination of the criteria for their award. The blue flag scheme is operated by the Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe, a non-governmental organisation, and is administered in Ireland by An Taisce. A grant of £41,928 was paid to An Taisce by my Department in 1999 as a contribution towards the costs of administering the scheme.</P>

      <P>The most recent assessment of local authority housing needs, including homeless persons, was carried out in March 1999. The assessment of the number of homeless persons was based on a broader definition of homeless persons which includes those with no accommodation, those in hostels and in health board accommodation and those staying with friends. Under this assessment, there was a total of 69 persons categorised as homeless in Waterford city, comprising of 55 adult males, six adult females and eight dependent children. At the time the assessment was carried out, these persons were living in hostel type accommodation. However, in general, not all persons identified as homeless in the assessment of housing needs would be in need of emergency accommodation. Some would stay with family or friends until suitable accommodation became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of course primarily a matter for the local authority concerned in this case, Waterford Corporation, to formulate responses to meet the accommodation and welfare needs of homeless people in their area in co-operation with the other statutory and voluntary agencies. For my part, I recently launched the Government's integrated strategy to tackle homelessness. It aims to provide an integrated response from all the statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to the homeless. It requires local authorities and <Col N="272" /> health boards to draw up action plans at city and county level to detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in providing these services. The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented.</P>
    <P>My Department has contacted all local authorities urging early implementation of the measures that have been identified. All of the county councils and the five county borough corporations have been asked to produce their action plans, jointly with health boards and voluntary bodies, within three months and by the end of August at the latest. My Department will be monitoring progress on these actions.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 593 of 26 January, 2000 concerning the measures <Col N="273" /> being taken in relation to the protection of groundwater.</P>
      <P>A groundwater quality monitoring programme is undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with local authorities and with the co-operation of the Geological Survey of Ireland. Comprehensive statutory provision for the protection of groundwater is contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and related legislation. Additional measures are put in place as required. I made the Protection of Groundwater Regulations, 1999, (S.I. No. 41 of 1999) in February 1999 in relation to discharges to aquifers by local authorities. Guidelines prepared jointly by the GSI, the EPA and my Department, on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes were issued to local authorities in May 1999. Proposals are also being developed in my Department for additional measures to be taken for the protection of groundwater against pollution by nitrates, including the designation of nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with EU Directive 91/676/EC.</P>
      <P>My Department's rural water programme comprises a range of targeted initiatives to improve the quality and efficiency of rural water supply systems and includes a specific measure to monitor the quality of groundwater and surface water sources nationally to determine the causes of pollution and to implement effective surface and groundwater source protection measures. Expenditure in 1999 under this programme amounted to some £210,000 and expenditure in the current year is estimated at £700,000.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated catchment-based strategy to tackle pollution of inland surface waters. Details of the strategy, including objectives and operation, are set out in the strategy document, Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes &ndash; A Catchment-Based Strategy against Eutrophication, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Major catchment-based projects are under way in relation to loughs Derg and Ree, Lough Leane and the three rivers, Boyne, Liffey and Suir, at a combined cost of some £6.82 million which is supported by European Union funds. The projects are led by local authorities and involve the participation of a wide range of stakeholders. My Department is now actively extending this strategy by promoting the establishment by local authorities, in the short to medium term, of catchment-based projects to address all sources of pollution in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters. In December 1999 local authorities were advised that financial assistance would be available in the context of the national development plan to support expenditure on such projects at a rate of up to 85% to develop such catchment-based water monitoring and management systems on an inter-authority basis.</P>

      <P>At 22 May 2000 some 92,200 applicants were on the waiting list for a driving test. Of these, some 26,000 have been given test appointments and some 15,700 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. On average applicants have to wait 21 weeks for a test. However, applicants who require a test for urgent <Col N="275" /> reasons are being given earlier appointments; about 38% of applicants are tested within 15 weeks. The average longest waiting time nationally is some 29 weeks, a reduction of 12 weeks relative to early 1999.</P>
      <P>Average waiting times are not compiled for individual test centres. The tabular statement below sets out the longest waiting time for each test centre.</P>

      <P>The quality standards, the minimum frequency of sampling and analyses and the method of analysis for the parameter mercury in surface freshwaters used for drinking water purposes are set out in the European Communities (Quality of Surface Water Intended for the Abstraction of Drinking Water) Regulations, 1989, (S.I. No. 294 of 1989). A copy of the regulations is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Mercury from the natural environment very rarely occurs in freshwaters and, if found, is likely to indicate industrial or other waste discharges. Regular monitoring is required for the purposes of the regulations where there is a possibility that mercury may be present or where previous monitoring of the waters involved indicates a need in that regard.</P>
      <P>Quality standards for discharges of mercury from various industrial sectors are set out in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, (Control of Hexachlorocyclohexane and Mercury) Regulations, 1986, (S.I. No. 55 of 1986). A copy of the regulations is also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to remove the means test for eligibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance in light of the fact that in a number of instances parents lodged this money into an account for their disabled son or daughter and used their own moneys to maintain the disabled person in order to provide support for the disabled person when the parents are deceased; if he will review the current situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of all other social assistance payments, disability allowance, formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance, is subject to a means test. The purpose of the means test is to ensure that limited resources are directed towards those with little, if any, additional income. For the purposes of assessing means, any savings which a person might have are treated as capital and are assessed along with the value of property and any cash income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current arrangements for assessing capital, the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5% and the balance is assessed at 15%. This means that a single person <Col N="277" /> can have capital of up to £38,347 and still qualify for a minimum payment of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy recently in response to a related parliamentary question, provision has been included in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, for the introduction of a new method of assessing the value of capital for social assistance purposes with effect from October this year.</P>
    <P>The new method of assessing capital will operate as follows: the first £10,000 of capital will be disregarded; capital between £10,000 and £20,000 will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; and capital above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements a single person will be able to have capital of up to £41,999 and still qualify for a minimum payment of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Any further relaxation of the means test would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and provides the necessary details, I will arrange to have it examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
      <P>The back to education schemes administered by my Department were established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for a period and whose opportunities of obtaining employment would be enhanced by participation in the schemes.

      <P>The use of the personal public services number by public service agencies as a unique identifier for individual clients is provided for by the Social Welfare Acts, 1998 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The number is issued and managed by my Department. The number is allocated to children as soon as they are registered for child benefit but the numbers are not issued to individuals until they reach the age of 16. At that stage young people are issued with a social services card, which is a magnetic stripe card, bearing their name, PPS number, issuer and date of issue and also carrying their date of birth, gender, primary account number, expiry date and card service code electronically encoded.</P>
      <P>The REACH initiative, established by Government in 1999, is charged with encouraging the use of the PPS number across the public service. It is also charged with developing a public services card to act as the individual's key to personal data and public services and to aid in the establishment of identity when conducting transactions with public agencies.</P>
      <P>In the context of more widespread use of the PPS number, the Department of Education and Science proposes to use it as the individual pupil identifier for new entrants to second-level schools from next autumn. My Department will supply the number for each pupil to the Department of Education and Science which will then issue the numbers to the pupils in due course.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to issue either the social services card or any form of smart card at this stage to these pupils pending development of a comprehensive card policy. The policy will deal with the future form and use of the public service card and the use of a smart card will be among the options considered. In the meantime, my Department will continue with the present arrangements for issue of the social services card.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week or £8 per week in smokeless zones is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April, regardless of the temperature. As a consequence, there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably low and equally, the allowance is paid at times when temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 17% in the last seven years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>Based on the expenditure for the 1999-2000 fuel season, the cost of extending the fuel season by one week would be approximately £1.7 million or £44 million to extend it for the full year. As such an extension to the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications, this could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account. The Deputy will note that the primary weekly payments were increased by either £4 or £7 per week in the most recent budget. I have no plans at this time to extend the fuel season for the full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of the year. This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme. Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity <Col N="280" /> may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The task force on the security of the elderly established by my Department in 1996 recommended the involvement of voluntary organisations as a means of identifying those elderly people deemed to be at risk in their communities and of ensuring the greatest level of local involvement to respond to these individual and diverse needs.</P>
      <P>The involvement of such organisations in identifying and addressing the security needs of older people in the community creates opportunities for groups to develop wider links with older people in their areas and has the potential to increase, in a very real sense, the support network available to vulnerable older people in the community while also allowing for a flexible response to individual needs. The knowledge of local conditions and people that local voluntary organisations possess has also allowed for a sensitivity of approach in administering the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that individuals may not always be aware of which voluntary organisations in their area actively participate in the scheme. However, my Department, through its various offices throughout the country, assists such individuals by advising them of which groups at local level are participating in the scheme and by initiating contact with the relevant group where necessary. In addition, my Department aims to ensure that individuals are aware of the scheme by advertising it on a national basis and by disseminating information on the scheme through a range of voluntary organisations and through the community liaison section of the Garda Síochána. Disseminating information in this way also ensures that vulnerable older people in the community who may not be aware of the scheme's potential benefits can be targeted for assistance <Col N="281" /> by voluntary organisations. To ensure maximum awareness of the scheme, my Department circulated a newsletter outlining details of all supports available to elderly people to some 330,000 pensioners last November.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy requires information on which voluntary groups may be operating in a particular area, I would be happy to provide details in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997, some 53,000 individuals have received assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the security needs of the most vulnerable older people were being met, my Department in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme in 1998 to consider how the scheme was meeting its objectives and whether it was doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
      <P>The review concluded that the security and social support of a large number of people had been greatly enhanced by the scheme. It also noted that, while the primary purpose of the scheme was to respond to the security threat to elderly people, it also had an important health-community care effect.</P>
      <P>While the review indicated a general satisfaction with the scheme among participating community groups, a number of issues of concern were raised by the groups consulted. These included the need for improved publicity for the scheme, the need to ensure that grants are as close as possible to the 90% maximum grant available under the scheme, and for more clarity on how to select applicants on the basis of vulnerability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have actively sought to address the issues of concern identified by participating groups and have endeavoured where possible to provide maximum funding under the scheme. My Department also actively enhances the profile of the <Col N="282" /> scheme and promotes its benefits by advertising it on a national basis and by disseminating information on the scheme through a range of voluntary organisations and through the community liaison section of the Garda Síochána. Disseminating information in this way also ensures that vulnerable older people in the community who may not be aware of the scheme's potential benefits can be targeted for assistance by voluntary organisations. In addition my Department, to ensure maximum awareness of the scheme, circulated a newsletter outlining details of all supports available to elderly people to some 330,000 pensioners last November.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the single most important conclusion of the review was that the available resources should continue to be targeted at those elderly people deemed at risk or vulnerable and unable to meet the cost of the equipment themselves. In accordance with the recommendations of the review, it was decided to maintain the existing eligibility criteria for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The review also identified a number of possible options with regard to the future management of the scheme, which included it continuing to be administered by my Department or being administered by other Departments-agencies. Having considered the experience of the scheme's operation since 1996 and the conclusions of the review that the scheme was, and continues to be, of significant benefit to many vulnerable older people, the Government decided to continue to operate the scheme under existing terms and there are no plans to amend or extend the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to forward copies of the review to the Deputy and to the Oireachtas Library for reference.</P>

      <P>My Department funds a number of organisations which have a national focus and expertise of working with specific groups or on specific themes to act as specialist support agencies &ndash; such as Travellers, people with disabilities or drugs. Such agencies provide a resource to the community development programme in relation to these issues as well as pro<Col N="283" /> viding specialist advice and support to local projects where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Domestic violence was identified by the CDP advisory committee in 1997 as one of a number of priority areas of work for the CDP. A specialised group with expertise in the area of violence against women was invited to apply for funding as a specialist support agency. The CDP technical group, which advises my Department on new areas of work for the programme, recommended that the group be funded under the CDP. Funding was approved in 1997 and it received £136,500 in 1999. The service provided is based on ongoing demands identified by projects within the programme.</P>
      <P>Funding to specialist support agencies is conditional upon the adherence to the terms of a three year contract with my Department and subject to satisfactory performance throughout the contractual period. Funding is provided towards the cost of employing full time staff, plus overhead and administration costs. The level of funding is determined after consultations between my Department and the particular agency.</P>
      <P>While in this instance, funding is designed to meet the needs of CDP projects in the area of violence against women, I am aware of the need to ensure that gender balance is maintained throughout the Department's community development support programmes taken as a whole. The support needs of the CDP are reviewed regularly. New specialist support agencies can enter in response to needs identified by the advisory committee or by my Department. Specific regional thematic needs or issues may then be proactively targeted with a view to bringing a new organisation into being to meet these needs, or applications may be accepted from existing organisations.</P>

      <P>A survey of the hen harrier population was carried out in the 26 counties in 1998-99 by my Department in partnership with Birdwatch Ireland and the Irish Raptor Study Group. This was the first national 26 county survey of the hen harrier to be carried out. The total number of known pairs of breeding hen harriers nationally is 80-96 pairs and this figure is likely to grow as coverage of two incompletely surveyed hill ranges is completed.</P>
      <P>The core range of the hen harrier is in the south-west of the country.

      <P>There are two elements to this project. The first involves construction of a staircase at the rear to allow public access to the upper floors. This will require the preparation of detailed working drawings by a structural engineer whose services are being sourced at present before going to tender. All going well, I hope to start these works later this year.</P>
      <P>The second element of the work involves conservation works to the stonework. The conservation works are of a type normally carried out by direct labour, but the craft workers needed to do this work are not currently available within my Department. It will be necessary, therefore, to recruit a team of stonemasons and general operatives and advertisements inviting applications for these positions will be placed in newspapers in the near future. This work needs to be carried out concurrently with the access staircase. If a team of workers cannot be recruited, consideration will have to be given to going to tender for this element of the work also.</P>
      <P>I point out to the Deputy, however, that it is uncertain at this stage whether such work would command any interest from suitable private building contractors while the additional costs involved could prove prohibitive. The matter will be reassessed in the light of responses to the advertisement.</P>

      <P>The proposed agreement between the United Kingdom and France facilitates the placing of British immigration officers at Eurostar rail departure points in France to check UK bound passengers with reciprocal arrangements for French immigration officers at UK Eurostar departure points.</P>
      <P>The question of a similar type agreement with France does not arise given that there are no direct rail links between Ireland and that jurisdiction. In so far as direct rail links with Northern Ireland are concerned it would not be possible to impose systematic, as distinct from occasional, checks on rail passengers from Northern Ireland given the existence of a common travel area between the respective jurisdictions which is of enormous value and relevance to the island of Ireland and Irish people generally.</P>
      <P>In a wider context, as I announced on 8 May 2000, the Government, as part of a number of measures agreed in relation to asylum, refugees and immigration matters, approved the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements by the placing of Garda liaison officers in London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities on, <i>inter alia</i>, immigration matters and in that regard, with particular emphasis on combating trafficking activity and on departures from major embarkation points to Ireland. As the vast majority of asylum seekers arrive in the State <i>via</i> the United Kingdom or France, the Government recognises that a strengthening of international liaison with those countries, in particular, will be important in identifying immigration trends and flows and other immigration related activities.</P>
      <P>In addition, I met with the British Home Secretary yesterday to discuss matters of mutual interest, including further co-operation in immigration matters generally and I will be having a similar meeting with the French Interior Minister on 19 June 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is enquiring as to the number of Garda CCTV systems that have been installed to date. My Department does not have a function in relation to the licensing of CCTV systems.</P>
      <P>The position is that three Garda CCTV systems have been installed to date in the State &ndash; in Temple Bar, Dublin, O'Connell Street in Dublin and Tralee in County Kerry. The CCTV systems were funded by my Department and the local business communities. It is important to remember that Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing Garda resources and, as such, must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. Applications for Garda CCTV systems are considered by the CCTV Advisory Committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. To date, the advisory committee has received in excess of 40 applications for Garda CCTV systems, as aids to policing. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems. These are in alphabetical order: Bray, Cork, Dublin &ndash; South Central &ndash; Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin to include Grafton Street and its surrounding areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. CCTV systems will also be installed in other areas in the future as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda CCTV systems can act as an overt deterrent to criminals. They can also assist in allaying the fears of the community in relation to crime in the areas where such systems operate. CCTV systems have been greatly welcomed in that they <Col N="290" /> create a safer environment in which people can go about their daily business in the knowledge that criminal elements are unlikely to take a chance with the presence of CCTV cameras. CCTV systems may also be of assistance in the detection of crime, the identification of suspects and the efficient use of Garda resources.</P>
    <P>Our experience to date of Garda CCTV systems shows that it has an important role to play in crime prevention and detection as well as in reassuring the public. The Garda authorities have confirmed its success and advised that assaults, drug-dealing, on street crime and so forth have dropped very appreciably where the cameras are in place. CCTV systems have also addressed a number of policing problems, that is, syringe attacks on tourists and at ATM's, anti-social behaviour and have proved vital to the success of a number of Garda operations. In this regard, a recent review by the Garda research unit has identified a number of key benefits which may be derived from the effective use of Garda CCTV systems: more effective management of resources; detection of events as they occur; increased levels of detection; reductions in certain categories of crime, especially robbery, larcenies from vehicles and burglaries; filmed evidence of events; filmed evidence may lead to guilty pleas and consequent reductions in court costs and reduction in the fear of crime.</P>
    <P>There are also intangible benefits, such as a public &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor, that are difficult to accurately quantify but which are also equally important when considering a CCTV system.</P>

      <P>The aims of SPHE are: to enable students to develop personal and social skills; to promote self esteem and self confidence; to enable students to develop a framework for responsible decision making; and to promote physical, mental and emotional health and well-being. Approximately 40% of second level schools have indicated that they either have already introduced this subject or plan to do so in September 2000.</P>
      <P>A national co-ordinator and regional development officers are being recruited in support of this initiative which will be implemented in collaboration with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.

      <P>The expert advisory group on the certificate examinations reported earlier this year. Its report did not contain any recommendation in relation to repeat examinations.</P>
      <P>There are significant difficulties in the provision of repeat examinations. Such constraints, inherent in a terminal and externally examined examination system, are not imposed by any Minister. They exist as fact and derive from the length of the school year, the time required for holding examinations, arranging for marking conferences, the numbers of suitably qualified persons available to act as examiners, the necessity to provide ample time for those examiners to conduct the marking to a high standard and by the pressing requirement of having results available to feed into the college entry process which is conducted by the CAO and college admissions departments in August each year. Given these constraints, our State examination system currently operates against the tightest of timescales and to maximum capacity in delivering a high quality product at both leaving and junior certificate levels.</P>
      <P>I should stress that every possible effort is made by my Department to assist candidates in sitting for their examinations. Each year, arrangements are made to cater for a wide range of emergencies. These include alterations to the standard examination timetable and special sittings in venues such as hospitals. My Department's psychological service also assists schools and students in crisis during the examinations.</P>

      <P>The option referred to by the Deputy required a student to make a submission on one of the main designated areas of study, drawing, <Col N="299" /> painting, sculpture, design, craft, and to submit a personal source diary and a thesis.</P>
      <P>I will clarify for the Deputy the position with regard to the award of the art teachers' certificate on the basis of my Department's technical school examinations in art.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1980, to qualify for the award of the art teachers' certificate, candidates had to secure a first class pass, 70% or more, in four subjects at advanced level. The individual subjects could be taken by set examination or, in the case of full-time students, by assessment. Circular 11/79 introduced a revised assessment process which again was restricted to full-time students. Under this process, a full-time student whose work was being assessed had to show a fuller expertise and a more developed and complete accomplishment in his or her work. The integration of the theoretical and historical with the practical was an increase in the quantity, quality and nature of what was required. A higher standard of attainment was required in line with the established art education norms of that time. The Deputy will note that a fully researched thesis had to be submitted as part of the requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current staffing of this school is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 92 at 30 September 1998. The enrolment on 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 81 <Col N="300" /> pupils. An enrolment of 83 pupils was required to retain the services of the third mainstream class teacher and, in the circumstances, I regret that this post cannot be retained.</P>
    <P>In addition to the mainstream staffing, the school also has the services of two remedial teachers, a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a temporary special additional assistant in recognition of the special needs of the school. The local inspector has been asked to provide an up to date report on the level of support required by the school to cater for the pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>I am finalising a new £194 million three year programme to tackle educational disadvantage under which significant financial and personnel resources will be allocated to schools with the highest concentration of at-risk pupils. This will facilitate the implementation of in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils and their families.</P>
    <P>I expect to make a further announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The assessment of the £13 million needed for investment in upgrading science facilities in second level schools was based on: (i) the uptake of the subjects in each of the science areas and (ii)estimates of the costs of upgrading science laboratory resources in schools which was informed by the current costs of supply of standard equipment lists for science laboratories in schools.</P>

      <P>A list of equipment for use in science laboratories will be forwarded directly to the Deputy within the next few days.</P>
      <P>The level of science facilities required by a school is based not on the school's total enrolment but rather on the number of students pursuing each of the science subjects. Accordingly, the actual cost of equipping laboratories can vary significantly depending on the number of laboratories to be provided, the range of equipment selected by the school's managerial authorities from the approved list of equipment, and related issues. In general, my Department provides between £30,000 to £35,000 to a school's management authority to equip one science laboratory.</P>
      <P>Funding for equipping science laboratories is an integral element of a building project in which science facilities are being provided.</P>

      <P>History, geography and science constitute the subject-block social, environmental and scientific education, SESE, in the revised primary curriculum. The recommended minimum weekly time-allocation for SESE as a whole is two hours 15 minutes for infants and three hours for classes I to VI. The three constituent subjects carry equal standing and should therefore be allocated a minimum of one third of the specified time, on average. However, because of the integrated nat<Col N="302" /> ure of the primary curriculum and particularly the link which exist within SESE between science and geography, it is possible that more time would be dedicated to one subject than to another in any given week. It is intended that these differences would be evened out over the course of a school term or school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is provision made in the revised curriculum for discretionary time of one hour per week for infants and two hours per week for classes I to VI. This time is to be allocated at the discretion of the school but each curricular area, including science, should receive its fair share of discretionary time over the school year.</P>

      <P>All primary and post-primary schools in the south Tipperary area have access to the educational psychological service. I am aware that the level of access to the service in the area at present has been affected by staff vacancies. However, I recently announced that 50 additional psychologists have been selected for appointment to the national educational psychological service and this will result in the vacant posts in south Tipperary being filled as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>A development plan for the extension of the national educational psychological service agency on a national basis is currently in the course of preparation. It is planned to employ some 100 psychologists by the end of this year and a total of 200 educational psychologists at the end of the development phase in 2004. The psychologists will be appointed to regions corresponding to the ten health board regions to facilitate effective liaison with colleagues in the clinical sector. In this connection I can confirm that there is regular liaison in the south Tipperary area between the NEPS psychologists and the South Eastern Health Board clinical psychologists. The South Eastern Health Board psychologists provide a range of clinical services for children in the area.</P>
      <P>The development plan will provide for the assignment of educational psychologists to the various regions on the basis of equitable and transparent criteria. It is envisaged that a total of four psychologists will be working in the south Tipperary area by the year 2002.</P>

      <P>The question of amalgamating the three <Col N="305" /> comprehensive schools in Ballymun has been the subject of discussion between the board of management of the schools and my Department on a number of occasions over the last decade. The most recent proposal in that regard came from the board last year, following consultation with the trustees and with staff.</P>
      <P>The point had been reached where the three schools, which were designed to accommodate in excess of 2,000 students, had a combined enrolment of less than 800. This development necessitated that serious consideration be given to rationalisation and the more efficient use of all the accommodation for educational purposes.</P>
      <P>It is now envisaged that the schools will amalgamate into the junior schools complex, which can accommodate approximately 1,500 students. In order for the junior comprehensive to accommodate the senior and junior cycles some refurbishment work and possibly some expansion is required.</P>
      <P>A schedule of accommodation has been drawn up and is currently being finalised. A design team has been appointed to prepare a report on the feasibility of accommodating the students from the three schools in the junior comprehensive building. This report has recently been received by the Department and is currently being examined.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the senior school building will be retained for educational purposes, and my officials will submit proposals to me in that regard in due course.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that disabled students are dropping out of college because of excessive delays in getting State funded grants to buy the <Col N="306" /> technology needed to support them in their studies.</P>
      <P>The special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and, since 1998, in post leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the special fund is to provide students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated to the special fund has increased substantially each year from an initial allocation of £80,000 in 1994. In 1999, the fund increased almost threefold to £700,000 from the 1998 allocation of £250,000. The 1999 fund of £700,000 was allocated to third level institutions and post leaving certificate centres in December 1999, to provide assistance to a total of 314 individual students in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>Once applications for assistance under the special fund are received by my Department at the beginning of the 2000-01 academic year, they will be dealt with expeditiously and awards will be made at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million. Building on the existing arrangements, the development of third level access is necessary to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students.</P>
      <P>The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications. It will, <i>inter alia,</i> meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of equipment and support services. Considerations are ongoing on the allocation for initiatives under this fund.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper on Adult Education proposed that barriers to participation in education of those aged 18 to 20 who left school with no qualifications should be removed, and that they should be allowed retain their training allowances. This arrangement is now being implemented. Youthreach eligible participants are generally those who left school early with no qualifications, or with less than five Ds in the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to reduce the entry age for the vocational training opportunity scheme from 21 years of age on the basis that the programme has been designed for older people with a record of unemployment, with special targeting of those who have been long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that students in the 18 to 21 age group may re-enter the education system to complete their education or to repeat the leaving certificate. For those resuming their education there is no charge. For those repeating the leaving certificate an annual fee of £100 applies, but this is waived in the case of medical card holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the responsibility for the operation of the community employment schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the provision of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced that with effect from September of this year, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different <Col N="311" /> school management and ownership arrangements at second level.</P>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
    <P>All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines, which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the phased nature of the development of the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; has led to difficulties in gaining access to psychological services in some areas. The entitlements of children with special educational needs has led to a noticeable increase in the demand for psychological assessments, including many requests from schools not yet being served by NEPS. I am conscious of the difficulties that this is causing at present. The matter is being addressed as a top priority by a working group of the management committee of NEPS, which includes representatives from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. The objective is to ensure that during the development phase of NEPS, structures and procedures are put in place to deal with urgent requests for psychological assessments.</P>
      <P>My Department is fully committed to the extension of an educational psychological service to all schools and expects to be in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year. This will double the present number of psychologists in NEPS. The management committee of NEPS is preparing a development plan for the phased expansion of the service. The priorities for expansion will be agreed by the management committee in consultation with local interests, including other providers of psychological services. It is envisaged that all schools will have a fully operational psychological service by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Pending the expansion of NEPS, I have asked the management committee to prepare proposals for my consideration in relation to a short-term grants scheme for schools, which would operate under the overall management of NEPS, for the purpose of funding psychological assessments administered by private practitioners.</P>
