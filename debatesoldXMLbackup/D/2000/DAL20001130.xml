      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Joe Higgins. I call on Deputy Joe Higgins to state the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Under Standing Order 31, I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to debate the following matter of urgent public importance: The need to change the crude, inappropriate and counter-productive policy of total deregulation of the taxi service which has resulted in the ongoing absence of taxis; and the need to discuss an immediate and ordered increase in the number of taxis, particularly in Dublin, in a way that provides the necessary improvements in the service while allowing those providing the service to make a reasonable living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it to be contemplated by Standing Order 31. Therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 41, Supplementary Estimates for Public Services [2000] [Vote 2] &ndash; (returned from select committee); No. 21<i>c</i>, Motion <i>re </i>Leave to Introduce Supplementary Estimates [Votes 19, 21 and 33]; No. 21<i>d</i>, Motion <i>re </i>Referral of Supplementary Estimates [Votes 19, 21 and 33] to select committee; No. 9, Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage; No. 8, Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 46, Youth Work Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage <i>(resumed). </i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 41, 21<i>c </i>and, subject to agreement on No. 21<i>c</i>, No. 21<i>d </i>shall be decided <Col N="230" /> without debate. Any division demanded thereon should be taken forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. That is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 41, 21<i>c </i>and 21<i>d. </i>Is that proposal agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is farcical that the House be asked to approve Estimates for Public Services when any member of the public would ask &ndash;  what public services? Before we agree to take this item without debate, can the Taoiseach say what the Government will do for children who are being deprived of their education and who are now into the seventh day of that deprivation. There has not been any action by the Government. The lethargy of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Education and Science has led to this dispute continuing for as long as it has. When will the Taoiseach and his Minister sit down with the ASTI and bring this dispute to an end?</P>
      <P>The only way to get action from the Government is to blockade the gates of Leinster House and prevent our democratic institutions from working. Groups who act in this way are granted a five hour meeting with a man while he prepares to go to Mexico.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What do teachers, parents and students, who are the ones I am most concerned about, have to do to have teaching services restored? Why are we agreeing an Estimate for Public Services when there is no public service? There are no taxis, no trains, no teachers and no help in hospitals.</P>

      <P>There is incredible anger throughout the nation at the various disputes which are going on. The least the House requires from the Taoiseach is leadership. Before we decide on the procedure to be adopted today, there should be a clear statement from the Taoiseach in relation to these major disputes.</P>
      <P>Parents are threatening to sue the Government in an unprecedented action to vindicate the right of their children to be educated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the House will be adjourned until next Tuesday, what does the Taoiseach and his Government intend to do between now and then to ensure that dialogue is opened with the ASTI to ensure that our children, whom the State is obliged to protect under the Constitution, will all get their equal rights to an education? Some students in TUI or private colleges are still getting their education. Parents are deeply concerned about the examination prospects of their children who are not being taught. The Taoiseach cannot sit on his hands in regard to this issue. We must see some action. We saw action when people blockaded the gates of this House. What do the teachers and parents have to do for the Government to enter into dialogue with the teachers and bring this dispute to an end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows this dispute will be brought to an end and that some solution will be <Col N="235" /> found for the demands of ASTI. Will he give an indication that our students will not lose any more school days because of this dispute? The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, might for once become a bit more proactive on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two aspects of this are being followed through on and developed. There have been talks over the past number of months with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC relating to the difficulties in public and private sector pay. Last night those talks went on until the early hours of the morning, as they did the night before. There is a commitment that they will meet again this afternoon and continue through the weekend if necessary. These talks are about all the issues and directly feed into the question the Deputy raised about ASTI.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to again ask the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland to use the process that is there. Hopefully we can come to some conclusion on the overall talks. From what many Deputies said here the other day, the teachers are anxious to find a forum where they can address the issues on which they feel they have fallen behind other professional workers in the State, where they can put forward their difficulties and where they can address some of the conditions they believe are problems for them. All these issues can be addressed. The forum for that is the benchmarking forum, which is chaired by an independent judge and where all these issues can be put.</P>
      <P>If the ASTI contacts the Minister in the next few hours, indicating it is prepared to use that benchmarking process &ndash; as the TUI and the INTO are &ndash; this matter will be over. This is a call for it to do that. There is no other resolution and it should do that.</P>

I heard the Tánaiste outline a similar policy this morning. A Minister of State <Col N="236" /> is saying something different, however. Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether it is acceptable to him for members of his Government to espouse a different view at local level from that espoused by him on behalf of the Government?</P>

    <P>Bill entitled and Act to amend the law relating to stealing and related offences and their investigations and trial; to give the force of law to provisions of the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests done at Brussels on 26 July 1995 and the three Protocols to that Convention; and to provide for consequential and related matters.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000: Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to introduce this important legislation. It is important for a number of reasons. First, it follows on a number of examinations of the law relating to dishonesty, which recommended significant changes. Second, it sweeps away a large amount of common law and statutory offences which often, because of the peculiar definition applied to such offences, caused confusion or, at worst, did not adequately address the problem encountered and replaces them with a modern code designed to meet current needs in this area. Third, it provides measures designed to assist in the investigation of offences of dishonesty and for changes in trial procedure in such cases.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based mainly on two reports &ndash; the Law Reform Commission report on the law relating to dishonesty and the report of the Government advisory committee on fraud. The Law Reform Commission recommended that the law relating to fraud and dishonesty should be consolidated in a single Act and that it should also include new offences to cover situations not covered at present. Its aim was to simplify and modernise the law in this area. This is easy to understand. The present law relating to theft and stealing is to be found mainly in the common law and the Larceny Acts of 1861, 1916 and 1990. Legislation relating to forgery and coinage offences date back to 1861. While these generally deal adequately with most serious offences of dishonesty, there are difficulties, such as the often artificial and confusing distinctions between, for example, larceny which includes such offences as obtaining possession by any trick and obtaining by false pretences. This latter offence also demonstrates the difficulty with some kinds of dishonesty, such as where one person obtains property or services from another based on a promise as to future intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is the multiplicity of offences dealing with essentially the same conduct. I am <Col N="247" /> thinking of the offences of larceny, which include offences of larceny of cattle, dogs, wills, legal documents and ore, abstraction of electricity and embezzlement. Furthermore, there is the definition of larceny which requires that the thing stolen should be carried away and that at the time of stealing the person should have the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. This is inconsistent with certain behaviour which should properly be classed as stealing. The Bill before the House will eliminate such inconsistencies.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Bill is also based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Fraud, whose chairman was Mr. Peter Maguire, senior counsel. These included reform of the substantive law on fraud as well as powers of investigation and related matters and are covered in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I have had the pleasure of introducing many Bills in this House since becoming Minister. One criticism which has been levelled at me about a number of those Bills dealing with criminal conduct is that they only catch the small time criminal or the unfortunate individual who engages in crime to feed a drug habit. It is alleged that the measures in the legislation will not catch the real culprits, the Mr. Big, and that so called white collar criminals will always escape. I have consistently rejected such notions. All the measures I have introduced are designed to ensure that anyone who engages in crime will have to face the consequences.</P>
    <P>This Bill is no exception. For example, section 56 deals with a situation where an offence is committed by a company with the consent or connivance of a director or manager of the company. In those circumstances, the person as well as the company will be guilty of an offence. A conviction for such an offence will leave the person open to a sentence of imprisonment and the company liable to a hefty fine. Assistance in detecting and investigating such offences is provided for in section 57 which requires certain persons, such as auditors, to report to the Garda matters which indicate that the company or those responsible for its operation may have committed an offence under the Bill. To those who might say the Bill only targets the disadvantaged in society, they should look at these sections.</P>
    <P>Further assistance in the investigation of offences of dishonesty and changes in trial procedure will tighten the net around those engaged in these forms of crime. Thus, the Bill contains in Part 7 provision for the granting of search warrants and orders for the production of evidential material as well as penalties for obstructing a garda executing such a warrant. It also provides that it will be an offence to falsify, conceal or destroy material relevant to an investigation.</P>
    <P>Part 8, dealing with the trial of offences, has provisions allowing any number of persons to be charged in the same indictment with handling or possessing stolen property either at the same or at different times as well as allowing up to three <Col N="248" /> separate takings to be tried together, provided they occurred within a six month period. In addition, stealing, handling or possession may be included in separate counts on the same indictment but may be tried together. There is also provision for a person charged with theft to be found guilty of handling or possession if the facts prove the latter and if charged with handling or possession to be found guilty of theft if the facts prove theft. An innovative measure included in this Part will allow the trial judge to order that the jury be provided with certain documents which the judge considers would be of assistance to them in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the primary aim of the Bill is to consolidate the law relating to dishonesty and to make it reflect the realities in Ireland at the beginning of the 21st century. Such reform is necessary even at a time when crime rates are falling, as we saw in the publication of the annual report of An Garda Síochána for 1999. Significantly, robbery and aggravated burglary showed a reduction of 6% on the previous year. In particular, I was extremely pleased to note that burglary, which accounts for 28% of all indictable offences and which causes considerable distress to many people, particularly the elderly, was down by 10%. Larcenies from shops and unattended vehicles were down by 9% and 7%, respectively. This reduction is the result of the Government's commitment to investment in the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>That investment can be seen in other initiatives. The programme for Government includes a commitment to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000 by the end of 2002. Increased intakes to meet this target commenced in 1998. In each of the years 1998 and 1999 there were 550 garda trainees recruited. A further 500 were recruited this year. The Government recently approved the holding of a competition this year and the recruitment of 500 garda trainees in 2001. The strength of the force at the end of October was 11,557.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant expansion in the use of CCTV as an aid in crime prevention and detection. The plan is to spend £12 million over the next three years and £4 million has been provided in the 2001 Estimates. Last week the CCTV system in the O'Connell Street and adjoining areas of Dublin was increased from 38 to 42 cameras and further extensions in Dublin and other areas are planned. In addition, a grant scheme will be introduced in 2001 to cater for areas which are not Garda priorities, but where local interests wish to take the initiative.</P>
    <P>The prisons building programme, which is proceeding on target, is an important element in my and the Government's strategy to combat crime. Phase 1, which provided for 1,207 of the 2,000 promised spaces, was completed on 9 November with the opening of the new 515 space Midlands Prison. Phase 2 includes the replacement of C block in Limerick Prison and C and D wings in Portlaoise Prison. Works in Portlaoise are at <Col N="249" /> planning stage and are expected to commence in late 2001. Together, these works will provide 90 additional spaces. Work on the refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison is expected to commence in late 2001.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 will also see the construction of approximately 590 new prison spaces, including 150 new spaces in Cork Prison, a new women's prison and a halfway house in Limerick which will create 40 spaces. Some 150 more spaces are to be created in Castlerea Prison and proposals are in place for 150 juvenile spaces in Dublin and Cork arising from the Children Bill. Proposals are also being examined for the provision of 100 pre-release spaces in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House. Phase 3 proposes 240 spaces in a new closed facility in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Even with these developments, there can be no room for complacency and I and the Government will continue to invest in improving the situation to prevent a slide backwards. That investment includes investment in the legal infrastructure, such as the Bill before the House. There are other important Bills for which I am responsible which are helping to build that infrastructure. These include the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill and the Sex Offenders Bill. Other measures which will come before the House in the coming months include a Criminal Justice Bill and a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a fundamental reform of the law on dishonesty and covers a wide range of activities. Inevitably, it is rather complex in parts. However, it is not only a reform of the law on dishonesty. It also contains provisions which are designed to give practical assistance in the detection and prosecution of offences. I would like to outline for the House the central provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with the title of the Bill, necessary definitions and repeals. Part 2 deals with theft and related offences. Section 4 creates a new offence of theft which will cover those situations currently covered by a wide range of offences, including larceny, embezzlement, obtaining by false pretences and fraudulent conversion. The new offence will consist of dishonestly appropriating property without the owner's consent and with the intention of depriving the owner of it, either temporarily or permanently. It also provides for situations where property is held in trust for or on behalf of more than one person by another person acting in the course of business and where some of the property is appropriated for the latter's benefit without the consent of the owner or owners. Where it is proved that there is a deficiency in the property without a proper explanation, there is a presumption that it was appropriated without the owner's consent. As I have already indicated, the broadness of the new offence of theft obviates the necessity for the multiplicity of specific offences, such as larceny and embezzlement, which co-exist at present. The <Col N="250" /> maximum penalty to be imposed following a conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine or up to ten years in prison or both.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for certain exceptions to the offence of theft, for example, where a person has obtained property for value and in good faith, even if the property in question subsequently transpires to be stolen property. The section also provides that land, or things forming part of it, cannot in general be stolen, except in specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>Both sections 6 and 7 deal with aspects of deception. Section 6 provides for an offence of making a gain or causing a loss by dishonestly inducing a person to do, or refrain from doing, something. Section 7 makes it an offence to obtain services by deception. This includes, for example, obtaining a loan, where the person has been led to believe that the loan has been, or will be, repaid. Under both sections, a penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both may be imposed following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a new offence of dishonestly making off without payment for goods or services, where the person knows that payment on the spot is required or expected and where he or she intends to avoid making payment. The section permits anyone to arrest, without warrant, a person on reasonable suspicion of being in the act of committing an offence under the section. However, there are certain constraints on this arrest provision. It is only permissible for non-gardaí to exercise it to prevent a person avoiding arrest by a garda and requires the arrested person to be transferred into Garda custody as soon as practicable. The penalty for an offence under this section is a fine of up to £3,000 or imprisonment for up to two years or both, following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 relates to the unlawful use of a computer in the State with the intention of making a gain or causing a loss. The person committing the offence may be either in or outside the State at the time of the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with false accounting. It encompasses such actions as destroying, concealing or otherwise falsifying an account or document, failing to complete it, making a misleading, false or deceptive entry or using any account or document knowing it to be false, for the purpose of furnishing false information.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that a person who dishonestly alters or suppresses certain types of document, to make a gain or cause a loss, is guilty of an offence. Actions covered by the section include destroying, defacing or concealing certain documents, or procuring the execution of a valuable security. The penalty for offences under sections 9, 10 and 11 is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with burglary. It provides that a person is guilty of burglary if he or she enters a building as a trespasser, intending to commit an <Col N="251" /> arrestable offence or, while there, commits or attempts to commit such an offence. The penalty is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to 14 years or both following conviction on indictment. An arrestable offence is an offence carrying a penalty of at least five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with aggravated burglary, in other words, the commission of a burglary by a person who has a firearm, imitation firearm, weapon or explosive with him or her. Section 14 deals with robbery and provides that a person who steals and, either at the time of or immediately before the stealing and in order to do the stealing, uses or threatens to use force against any person is guilty of the offence of robbery. The penalty for conviction on indictment for aggravated burglary and robbery will be imprisonment for up to life.</P>
    <P>Section 15 relates to the possession of certain articles by a person for use in relation to certain offences, such as theft or burglary. An offence under this section carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the handling etc. of stolen property and other proceeds of crime. Section 16 sets out key definitions for use within this Part of the Bill. Section 17 creates an offence of handling stolen property, that is where a person, knowing or being reckless as to whether property was stolen, dishonestly receives it or makes arrangements to do so, or retains, removes or disposes of it. A penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both may be imposed following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 18 creates a new offence of possession of stolen property to address difficulties under existing legislation which arise when a person is found in possession of stolen property but the question of whether that person has stolen such property or is handling it remains unclear. The offence created is to the effect that the person, without lawful authority or excuse, possesses stolen property knowing or being reckless as to whether it was stolen. Where circumstances would reasonably lead to the conclusion that the person knew or was reckless as to whether it was stolen, a court or jury may take the view that the person did know the property was stolen or was reckless on this point, unless satisfied there is a reasonable doubt about this. The penalty for conviction on indictment is imprisonment for up to five years or an unlimited fine or both.</P>
    <P>Section 19 sets out certain circumstances under which a garda may require a person to give him or her an explanation of how stolen property, or the proceeds from it, came into that person's possession. Failure to give a truthful account of how this property or proceeds came into the person's possession carries a maximum penalty of a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both on summary conviction.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides clarifications to the preceding sections in this Part of the Bill, by providing that references to stolen property include prop<Col N="252" /> erty whether it had been stolen before or after the Act commenced, or had been stolen outside the State, within certain limitations. It also extends the scope of this Part to include proceeds arising from the disposal of the stolen property, whether in whole or in part. Finally, it states that property which has been returned to its rightful owner will not be regarded as having continued to be stolen property.</P>
    <P>Regarding sections 21 and 22, it is intended that they will be deleted from the Bill and will be included, instead, in the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill, 2000. I will deal further with this later in my speech.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with forgery. It enacts offences in a modern form which are currently covered by the Forgery Acts, 1861 and 1913, which are being repealed in full.</P>
    <P>Section 23 contains some necessary definitions. Sections 24 to 27 deal with the making and use of false instruments or copies of false instruments intending their use in order that another person will accept them as genuine. Offences under these sections carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the custody or control of certain false instruments. These include money orders, stamps, cheques, credit cards, share certificates, passports and tickets. It provides for an offence of having control or custody of any of the specified false instruments with a view to inducing another person to accept it as genuine and of having them in one's custody or control without lawful excuse. It will also be an offence to have custody or control of a machine or of material suitable for use in the making of a false instrument, or with the intention of passing them off as genuine. The maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both will apply to offences related to possession, while the maximum penalty applicable to offences relating to the intention to use such instruments will be an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 provide further definitions of key terms. Part 5 deals with counterfeiting. Its focus is on combating the counterfeiting of currency notes and coins. In particular, it will provide protection to the euro currency, even before the date of issue.</P>
    <P>Following the definitions in section 31, section 32 provides for an offence of counterfeiting where a person makes a counterfeit note or coin with a view to passing it as genuine, and where a person does this outside the State in order to pass it as genuine within an EU member state. This offence carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years, or both, following conviction on indictment. Section 33 makes it an offence to pass or tender a counterfeit as genuine, whether directly or via a third party, and makes it an offence even to knowingly deliver a counterfeit to another person, without lawful authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> Section 34 provides that a person who has a counterfeit note or coin in his or her custody or control with the intention of passing or tendering it as genuine, or of giving it to another person as genuine, is committing an offence. It also makes it an offence even to have such a counterfeit in one's custody or control, without lawful authority.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with materials and implements for counterfeiting and makes it an offence to make or have custody or control of anything to be used for the purpose of counterfeiting, or to have anything, without lawful authority, which is designed or adapted for counterfeiting.</P>
    <P>Offences under sections 33, 34 and 35 carry maximum penalties of an unlimited fine or either five years imprisonment or five years imprisonment or both a fine and imprisonment, depending on the circumstances of the offence. Under section 36, a person who, without lawful authority, imports a counterfeit note or coin into a member state of the European Union, or exports such a note or coin from a member state, is guilty of an offence, the penalty for which is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Part 6 provides that the provisions of the EU Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests, and the three protocols to that convention, will have the force of the law in the State. The convention requires each member state to provide for criminal penalties against the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documentation, resulting in the misappropriation, or misapplication, of Community funds, and the illegal reduction of the communities' general budget. The protocols deal with such matters as corruption by or against national and Community officials, which damages or is likely to damage the communities' financial interests, jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and co-operation between member states and the Commission.</P>
    <P>Part 7 deals with the investigation of offences. It provides for the issue of search warrants and makes it an offence to obstruct a garda acting under warrant. It also aims to protect documents which may be relevant to an investigation and provides that evidential material, where ordered by a district judge, must be either produced to a garda or the garda allowed access to it.</P>
    <P>Part 8 deals with the trial of offences. It provides for the summary trial of indictable offences under the Act where all parties agreed to this. It also deals with a number of aspects of trial procedures, in particular giving assistance to juries in complex cases. It also allows for flexibility in relation to charges of theft, handling or possession, in that a person charged with theft may, if the facts so prove, be found guilty of handling or possession, and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>Part 9 deals with a range of miscellaneous issues such as making it an offence to use and assumed name to commit an offence under the <Col N="254" /> Bill, the liability of companies or their directors for offences and obligations on certain persons, such as auditors, to report suspected offences. There are also provisions dealing with the admissibility of certain types of evidence in proceedings, for example, documentation, including translations, provided by an overseas lawyer about comparable offences under that state's legal system and documentation provided by an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the effect that a person is an Irish citizen. Other sections deal with jurisdiction where an offence was committed aboard a vessel in Ireland's territorial seas as well as miscellaneous amendments or repeals of other Acts and standard provisions dealing with transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have, of necessity, given only an outline of the provisions of the Bill at this stage. To go into any greater detail than I have done would require considerably more time than is available to me. However, if there are particular matters which Deputies would like to have clarified, I will endeavour to do this in my reply to the debate. In addition, there will be the opportunity during the Committee Stage, should Deputies require it, to go into detail on the sections and to see how they compare with the present law in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline for the benefit of the House some amendments which I will propose to the Bill on Committee Stage. It is well recognised that the output of legislative proposals from my Department has been and remains prodigious. To date, 34 Bills have been enacted since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There are nine Bills currently before the Oireachtas and a considerable number at various stages of preparation. Inevitably in such circumstances it transpires that a provision which is being included in one measure may turn out to be more appropriate to another. Section 21 of the Bill is a case in point. It substitutes a new section for section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, dealing with money laundering. However, another Bill before the House, the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill, 2000, which will require that a number of changes be made to the 1994 Act, including section 31, would be a more appropriate Bill in which to make the necessary changes. It is proposed, therefore, to provide for the appropriate amendment to be made through the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill, 2000 and, accordingly, I will move an amendment on Committee Stage to delete section 21 of the current Bill. A consequential amendment will also delete section 22, which is related.</P>
    <P>In dealing with such a comprehensive reform of the law as this Bill does, it is inevitable that issues arise even after publication which need to be addressed. In that Part of the Bill dealing with forgery, it is intended that custody or control of certain forged instruments should be penalised. Section 28 sets out a range of such instruments. Since publication of the Bill, it has been pointed out to me that it would be appropriate to include other instruments such as registration certificates <Col N="255" /> under the Aliens Act. I will bring forward the appropriate amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this.</P>
    <P>Part of the Bill deals with counterfeiting and extends to counterfeiting of the euro even before euro notes and coins are issued. Article 105.4 of the Treaty on European Union requires member states to consult the European Central Bank regarding certain draft legislation. The present Bill, dealing with protection of the euro, falls within the relevant category. Following publication of the Bill, therefore, the relevant sections were referred to the European Central Bank for their opinion. There will be some minor amendments required to Part 5 following the opinion of the ECB, which I will propose on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the matter of amendments, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to section 50 to provide that the penalty to be imposed following summary conviction will be imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of up to £1,500 or both.</P>
    <P>It would be naive of me to think that a Bill such as this is perfect in every way and to have a closed mind on matters relevant to it. Therefore, I give the House an assurance that I will listen earnestly to the debate and take on board any suggestions from Deputies which I think will improve it. I will not be slow to consider amendments if they seem to advance the objectives for which the Bill stands.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I have consistently stated that anyone who engages in crime will face the full rigours of the law. Where necessary I have brought forward legislation to provide for appropriate penalties for those guilty of serious offences. There are also measures in preparation to further assist in the investigation of offences. The law must be kept under constant review and where shortcomings are identified these should be remedied. Sometimes, such a review points to the need for fundamental change requiring a root and branch reform of the law in a particular area. That is the position with the law on fraud and dishonesty, and that is the reason the present Bill is necessary and that I am happy to move it in the House.</P>
    <P>I should explain that I must leave for a little while due to a prior engagement. I mean no discourtesy to the main spokespersons for the Opposition parties. Careful note will be taken of what they have to say, and I will try to be here for as much of the debate as I possibly can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House. The Minister is never slow to praise himself, but may find it unusual to be praised by someone on the Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has had an extraordinarily long gestation period. A report published in 1992 by the Law Reform Commission and another in 1993 by the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud <Col N="256" /> recommended broad changes to the laws in this area. Going back to my student days as a young law student dealing with the fraud legislation then in force &ndash; the Larceny Act, 1916, and other legislation &ndash; it was clear there was a need for modernisation and consolidation of the legal provisions that apply in this area. In so far as we have this Bill in the House today, I welcome the fact that it is here. It has been long awaited. Various Governments of different political hues could have addressed this issue with greater urgency, but at least now we have it.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill that could be better teased out on Committee Stage rather than in the context of a Second Stage debate. A number of technical issues arise under particular sections that we need to look at carefully to ensure the objectives the Minister wishes to achieve in the context of the provisions contained in the Bill are achieved and that technical difficulties do not arise in successfully processing prosecutions in the circumstances in which that should be done. I will, therefore, confine my remarks to some general observations on issues relating to the Bill and other issues of relevance to sentencing which apply both to this Bill and other matters.</P>
    <P>However, I want to point out, by way of marker to the Minister and his advisers, that they might consider two or three issues about which I have some concerns in the context of the breadth of definition, in particular, in relation to criminal offences, and the possibility of their application in circumstances which are inappropriate. In that context, I want to refer to section 6 which is referred to as a section relating to the making of gains or causing of loss by perception. Under section 6, a person who dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of causing loss to another, induces another to do or refrain from doing an act is guilty of an offence. I understand the reason this provision is in the Bill. There are certain circumstances in which such a section may seem appropriate. However, what I am concerned about is the possibility of a business venture, properly engaged in by an individual, simply going wrong because of bad business judgments, and a person who is resentful that profits he or she expected to make were not made and substantial losses and difficulties were created invoking the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise would be indicted on the Eircom shares fiasco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet come to the Bill's implications for Ministers. In the context of the ordinary conduct of business where things simply go wrong and people make incorrect judgments, I am concerned that this section could criminalise a broad section of the community and give rise to all manner of prosecutions, which, in real terms, would be spurious. I am concerned that a plethora of prosecution proposals could arise which would detract from the intention of this provision. The Minister may say that to some degree the <Col N="257" /> inclusion of the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; which is defined as &ldquo;without a claim of right made in good faith&rdquo; solves the problem and will be of some assistance. I would not be convinced by that. I can think of all manner of business arrangements where problems could arise, for example, where people are encouraged to invest money in particular schemes. Everyone could be acting properly and in good faith but it could be argued, if things were to go wrong, that one person was acting dishonestly.</P>
      <P>I presume the gain envisaged in the section is a monetary gain. I wonder whether politicians who, in fits of political and electoral enthusiasm, make all sorts of promises to the electorate to the effect that if they are voted in to Government, the public will benefit financially, could be accused of acting dishonestly because they intend making a gain for themselves, such as securing election and ministerial office, and may cause a loss to other people through the imposition, for example, of additional taxation. This could result in the entire membership of a future Government or even of the current Government being subjected to criminal prosecution. This is an extraordinarily broadly drafted section which could bring a series of ordinary human conduct, which I am sure the Minister does not intend to criminalise, into the net. The section should be carefully re-examined.</P>
      <P>Section 7 gives rise to similar and related worries concerning someone obtaining services by deception. If I am served a good meal in a restaurant but fail to pay the bill and never intended to pay it, I should, of course, be open to prosecution. If I secure other services without intending to pay for them, my actions should be regarded as criminal. What happens if I ask a builder to build an extension to my house but am dissatisfied with the service provided and withhold payment? Could the builder threaten me with prosecution for dishonestly obtaining his services? If I have a row with a solicitor who is acting on my behalf in a particular legal case, question his competency in representing me and a row ensues in regard to the payment of fees, am I open to prosecution for dishonestly obtaining his services? I may choose to go abroad on holiday and may not pay the travel agency the full amount before I depart. I could withhold payment if, instead of finding myself in a five star hotel or comfortable modern apartment by the sea, I find myself in the back of beyond without running water, a prison style bed and without decent food. Could the travel agency prosecute me in that instance? I am aware that it is not the Minister's intention that such circumstances would result in prosecutions but we must consider the manner in which the section is drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 are so broadly drafted that they could create very real problems. People who act properly and honestly but who make mistaken judgments may find themselves the subject of Garda investigations. People who receive bad service, which would inevitably result in a civil court action in the event of a dispute over payment, <Col N="258" /> could find themselves on the receiving end of a Garda investigation and could be threatened with prosecution. Vulnerable people may find that people with greater financial clout will threaten to take matters to the Garda if services which were not properly provided in the first instance are not paid for in full. I urge the Minister to re-examine these sections very carefully because they go far beyond the type of provisions which should comprise part of criminal law and will result in the criminalising of all manner of disputes which would normally be resolved through civil litigation.</P>
    <P>We must also be careful about section 10. If people engage in false accounting, fiddle the books, fail to pay their taxes properly or deprive other people with whom they are in business of moneys to which they are entitled, their actions should give rise to criminal prosecutions. However, I raise a query in regard to the reference in the section to someone concealing or falsifying accounts or failing to make various disclosures. In the context of court proceedings where documentation is produced and financial disputes between parties give rise to civil actions in the area of company or family law, for example, will a sworn affidavit which does not totally and comprehensively represent the true financial position in regard to a certain issue, either deliberately or in error &ndash; a person may not have all of the information which should be included in an affidavit at his or her disposal &ndash; lead to people engaged in litigation, whose failures fall short of perjury, being prosecuted? This is an important question which I wish to bring to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>In family litigation, which is heard <i>in camera</i>, judges may discover false accounting where, for example, a person may be defrauding the Revenue Commissioners. Will a member of the Judiciary hearing cases under the<i> in camera </i>rule be obliged to refer papers to the DPP under this section concerning a person who has dealt incorrectly with the Revenue or has falsified business or company accounts? I raise these issues because there is a series of different court judgments dealing with these areas to which I wish to refer.</P>
    <P>I now turn to an issue to which the Minister referred in passing which arises under section 51 on trial procedure provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 51(4) states:</P>
    <P>if on the trial of a person for stealing any property it appears that the property alleged to have been stolen at one time was taken at different times, the separate takings may be tried together, to a number not exceeding 3, provided that not more than 6 months elapsed between the first and the last of the takings.</P>
    <P>Why is the period limited to six months and why are the separate takings limited to three? Why should a person who has been engaged in a series of thefts of property from one victim over a period of two, three or four years not be tried for all those thefts on one count so the totality of the <Col N="259" /> moneys or properties stolen and their value is placed clearly before the court in the context of determining conviction and sentence? I do not understand the need to so constrain the provision, which should be broader. The number of takings should not be limited to three and the period should not be limited to six months. I will return to these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 53 raises another issue. Our criminal law provisions should have greater provision for restitution to be paid to victims in circumstances where the perpetrator of a crime has assets or funds out of which restitution can be made. In the context of a wrong having been committed it is clear that where the person who perpetrated the wrong is a person of substantial or reasonable means, there is no reason a court which finds the person guilty should not be empowered to make a full restitution order to the victim where possible. In the Bill the restitution provision seems to be confined to funds found on the offender at the time of arrest, which seems far too limited. I fully support the idea of making restitution and believe we should have broader legislation in this area. If a person who embezzles £200,000 or £300,000 has a variety of different deposit accounts which cannot be directly related to the original sum embezzled, the court should be able to order that the £300,000 be repaid to the victim from whom it was taken. Why should a victim have to deal with this through a separate civil action subsequent to criminal proceedings? The success of the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation, which allows the State take large funds obtained as the result of crimes, should be broadened so that those convicted of crimes which result in a loss being sustained by an individual can be ordered to make restitution where the means exist to do so.</P>
    <P>On occasion in the context of certain types of theft, larceny, fraud and embezzlement, people are willing to take the chance of being caught, particularly in the context of major crimes, on the basis that if they are caught and serve their sentences they will have a nest egg on their release if they manage to get the money out of the country or at least separate it so that it cannot be identified with the individual crime.</P>
    <P>Section 54 provides for various additional information to juries. The thinking behind this is very good. I will return to certain aspects of this on Committee Stage. In the context of other types of offences, should there not be similar provision for other types of criminal trials in circumstances where it would be appropriate for the jury to be given information derived from the trial process? The provision is welcome, but it is important that we extend it to other circumstances.</P>
    <P>I will return in detail to other aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage. However, I wish to raise a difficulty which has arisen and which applies to the Bill and criminal prosecutions in general. I am surprised the Minister did not refer to it in his <Col N="260" /> speech as he dealt not only with the Bill but also referred to some other general issues which fall within his brief which are relevant to criminal law and ensuring offenders are brought to justice. A very important judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court on 24 November in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v</i>. Padraig Finn. The case is of great importance. The practice of the courts, going back some 20 years, has been for judges when imposing sentence to take it upon themselves to determine that after a period of time has been served the matter comes back before the trial judge who heard the case for review. Except in one particular area, the provision has no statutory basis. Courts and judges adopted the provision for a variety of reasons, one being the revolving door syndrome and the concern that a sentence imposed would not be served as a result of a person being released early from prison, rendering the sentence imposed farcical and thereby undermining the administration of justice. Some judges provided for a sentence review mechanism on the basis they assumed that at the very least the initial portion of the sentence would be served and the person sentenced would remain in prison. On other occasions a review mechanism was put in place to encourage an offender sentenced to imprisonment to engage in certain treatment, for example, for alcoholism or drug addiction, and the carrot was held out that if after serving a sentence for one, two or three years the offender had come to terms with his or her addiction or difficulties, the court could review the sentence and determine if the offender could be safely released into the community. In effect the judiciary was operating its own early release system. The judgment by the Supreme Court has made it absolutely clear that in no future case can a judge when passing sentence provide for a review of the sentence. The court made reference to the Constitution, in particular Article 13.6 which states:</P>
    <P>The right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the President, but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.</P>
    <P>By making reference to this article, and in the absence of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas conferring on the courts a power to review sentences imposed, the Supreme Court has made it clear that any future decision made by a court when imposing sentence cannot properly include a review mechanism.</P>
    <P>Should it do so, that sentence can be struck down by an order of <i>certiorari</i> in proceedings subsequently brought and is clearly outside the power of the courts.</P>
    <P>The issue I had expected the Minister to address in his speech is what the Government intends to do. There are circumstances in which it is in the interests of justice and in which it is in <Col N="261" /> the interests of the general public that sentences be reviewed after a period. There is a need to put sentence review on a statutory basis. A decision must be made by the Government on whether to establish a parole board to provide for a transparent and organised statutory system to review sentences after persons convicted have served a portion of sentences or to enact legislation to confer on the courts a power to review sentences, in particular cases, where judges wish to exercise such power, and at the time of sentencing decide that it is desirable that a review be provided for. Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, provides for the imposition of a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of ten years for certain drug offences. It also provides that, in imposing a sentence on a person convicted of an offence under section 15 A of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, a court can make provision for review. That Act provides that the court, when sentencing, may inquire whether at the time of the commission of the offence the person was addicted to one or more controlled drugs and, if satisfied that the person was so addicted at the time, and if the addiction was a substantial factor leading to the commission of the offence, may list the sentence for review after the expiration of not less than one half of the period specified by the court, under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) of the particular section. It provides that on reviewing a sentence, the court may suspend the remainder of the sentence on any condition it sees fit and in deciding whether to exercise its power under the subsection may have regard to any matters it considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, is the only statutory provision in place which confers on the courts the power to review sentences. There is a broad range of cases going through the courts in which it may be the view of the trial judge that it is in the interests of justice or in the public interest that a review of sentence occurs but there is no formal mechanism for that to happen. The courts can no longer do it. There is no transparent system within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under which this can be exercised. The revolving door syndrome, which the Minister likes to say ceased from the day he came into office &ndash; although that is not correct &ndash; which has continued to operate all the way through to this year is the only method for early release of a general nature. The power the Minister exercises and which has been conferred on the Minister under the 1951 Act has been described as haphazardly exercised with no transparency of any nature. This is an issue which impacts substantially on the administration of the criminal justice system. It is an issue also which impacts on the Exchequer. If judges can no longer determine that certain cases are appropriate for review, and prisoners should be released after particular periods, and if the Minister continues to operate a haphazard system that lacks transparency, it is inevitable that people will be kept in prison in circumstances <Col N="262" /> when it may no longer be in the public interest or in the interests of justice and will be a substantial burden on the Exchequer. Recent estimates, depending on the institution, range from £70,000 to £100,000 per year to keep a person in prison.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Government to say what steps it will take as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision. Is statutory provision to be made for a parole board and, if so, what type of board? What substantive provisions will apply to it? Given the length of time it takes for substantive legislation to be processed, it is highly unlikely that a parole board will be put in place, under statute, during the lifetime of this Government. If that is the case, what interim measure does the Minister intend to take pending legislation to establish such a parole board? I accept it will take some time to set up a parole board. Is the Minister considering emergency legislation to confer a statutory power on the Judiciary when passing sentence to provide for a review date pending the introduction of legislation to provide for a parole board? If so, it is also essential, in the event that sentence has been passed and statutory provision has been made for a review date and if a decision is made subsequently to release someone into the community following review, that an appeal mechanism be put in place.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that the Minister has remained silent. The Minister should not have been surprised at the judgment of the Supreme Court. A report on sentencing, published by the Law Reform Commission, which goes back to August 1996 sets out the need to provide proper statutory mechanisms to deal with sentencing, not only in the context of a review but it pointed out that there is no statutory mechanism in place with regard to the provision of suspended sentences. That issue must be addressed. The Minister must also take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the constitutional provision which seeks to guarantee that justice is administered in public is maintained. We have had a series of eccentric decisions by members of the Judiciary who have sought either to prevent the media reporting criminal trials or have taken other steps or made comment, which is contrary to the spirit of openness which is supposed to apply to the administration of the criminal justice system. In that context there is a particular concern in regard to legislation in place concerning the prosecution of individuals who have committed sexual offences that provisions designed to protect the anonymity of victims are frequently being used to protect the anonymity of offenders. This has happened on some occasions where victims have said they wanted the offender to be named. Some judges have taken it on themselves to determine that an offender should not be named. The message should go out from this House that criminal justice must be administered in public and that where people are charged with or convicted of offences in circumstance in which there are statutory provisions in place, we should seek to protect the anonymity of victims. In circumstances where <Col N="263" /> the victims state they are not relying on those provisions, it is in the public interest that the perpetrators of offences, or those accused of offences, are properly named and that the newspapers and the media are not curtailed in publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say a few words about the genesis of this important Bill which I welcome on behalf of the Labour Party. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, seeks to consolidate the law on dishonesty, more properly the law on larceny.  </P>
      <P>First I will to talk about the genesis of the Bill and then go into some detail. Like Deputy Shatter, I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill, including a range of the new measures contained in it. We will have a better opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out the Minister's intentions, the import of the sections and table amendments as are deemed appropriate on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill updates the Larceny Acts, principally the 1916 Act. Equivalent updating was first attempted by the British House of Commons in its Theft Act, 1968. As the Minister stated in his speech, the Bill before us is largely based on two reports &ndash; the Law Reform Commission report on dishonesty dated 1992 and the report of the Government advisory committee on fraud published in 1993. The question that arises, therefore, is not just whether the Bill is welcome on its merits, but why Bills of this nature take so long to wind their way into legislative proposals to be considered by Members of this House. My suspicion is that if it were not for the Article K convention requirement under the European Union treaties on the protection of financial interests of the Community, we would be waiting yet for this measure to come before us. Although it goes well beyond the scope of the protection of the currencies of the European Union, it clearly was an imperative under our treaty obligations to enact a portion of this legislation. I believe that was the spur to activity that brought the Bill in its current shape before us. The question arises whether no work is being done in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's law division until the very last minute or the work was completed some time ago and was simply in the long queue for ministerial consideration and, ultimately, for parliamentary time to which the Minister referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued for three and a half years that it was a mistake to amalgamate the Department of Justice with the Department of Equality and Law Reform because a variety of important measures are constantly jockeying for primacy within the Department. This means the most urgent measures do not always make it to the top of the list because there are other imperatives as we have witnessed in recent months and years. For example, there are our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement or, as in this case, our obligations under EU treaties. I would have pre<Col N="264" /> ferred to have two separate Departments, one with responsibility for the criminal side of legal reform and the other dealing with many important equality measures. I acknowledge that the Minister has made a fair effort at balancing the two sections of his Department and has worked extremely hard. However, I am not sure his best effort in trying to balance competing demands is always good enough for the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to decide, given that such reports are commissioned in the first instance, why the recommendations are implemented partially or in a piecemeal fashion. The explanatory memorandum does not explain the reasons for or even outline the extent to which this legislative proposal departs from the detailed recommendation in those reports. For example, recommendation 1 of the Law Reform Commission states that &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; should be defined in terms of absence of a claim of legal right. Section 2 states that &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; means without a claim of right made in good faith. The Law Reform Commission's second recommendation was that a key requirement at present imposed on the prosecution that it must prove an intent on the part of the accused to deprive the owner permanently of property should be dropped. Section 4 of the Bill specifically preserves this requirement. Much of this detail can be teased out on Committee Stage. However, it would be useful if in his Second Stage response the Minister would indicate in general terms the recommendations of the two reports, where he has departed from the recommendations and the reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of other points in relation to this particular measure. I welcome the focus of the legislation and the Minister's declared commitment to deal with white collar crime. Members on this side of the House, together with Government backbenchers, have in the past focused on the difficulty in taking prosecutions against individuals responsible for serious criminal acts which fall into the category of white collar crime. We have all witnessed the difficulties posed in the investigation, much less the prosecution, of such criminal acts. The tribunals of inquiry regularly feed out the difficulty to us in following the money trail and in getting at beneficial ownership to see where fraud has taken place. These can be very long and complicated trails, criss-crossing various jurisdictions. I am aware of an investigation which is currently under way by a committee of this House where it is very difficult to determine a matter of fact on the beneficial ownership of particular company assets, or even whether an individual is a director of a registered company in jurisdictions other than our own. I cite the example of Jersey where there is no domestic legal imperative on the registration of directors of companies.</P>
    <P>What is clearly required to augment the very good proposals in the legislation before us, but which refer only to this jurisdiction, is much better co-ordination at international level in relation <Col N="265" /> to the investigation and openness of authorities to assist in the investigation of large scale fraud. Many jurisdictions are obstructive to that type of investigation. While there has been improvement at European Union level, there is a requirement for the EU to engage much more vigorously with those states that, at least by reputation, harbour laundered money, or harbour by repute the ill-gotten gains of criminal activity. That level of pressure must be brought by the international family of nations on states that derive part of their income from giving at least the perception of a welcome for &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money. I would welcome the Minister's response to what international treaties, discussions or initiatives are to be taken by the European Union to ensure the legislative framework to combat international fraud and theft is at least comparable to the global facility that now exists to transfer resources around the world with great alacrity.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the various measures he had put in place had somehow had a dramatic impact on crime prevention. He referred to the deployment of additional gardaí, the provision of extra prison spaces and the putting in place of initiatives such as closed circuit television, etc. If we accept the Minister's point of view, these developments have had a remarkable impact in terms of reducing serious crime in the State. However, a great deal of this is illusory.</P>
    <P>There is an unprecedented level of concern about crime, particularly serious crime, abroad at present. Statistics can prove anything, but the reality is that the most serious types of crime, including murder and rape, have entered the consciousness of the people in a way which is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures on crime available to me were provided by the Minister in reply to Dáil questions tabled on 15 November when he informed the House that 38 murders were recorded by the gardaí last year. Up to 15 November last, 31 of these had been detected. The Minister also informed the House that 34 murders had been recorded up to 15 November. That is an horrendous statistic by any stretch of the imagination because each crime encapsulates an enormous tragedy for the people directly affected. We cannot be complacent in the fact of that serious epidemic of murder. We cannot pretend that crime is under control. I ask the Minister to specifically refer to that matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 October, the legal affairs correspondent stated:</P>
    <P>There were more rape and murder cases waiting to be dealt with in the Central Criminal Court when it resumed after the summer than had been concluded in the whole of the previous year.</P>
    <P>According to figures compiled by the court registrar, 170 rape cases and 53 murder cases were outstanding on August 14th. Of these, 47 were awaiting sentencing. In the legal year ending July 31st the court dealt with 103 cases involving rape and 30 murder cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> It is clear that there two extraordinary things are happening. There has been a serious escalation in crime, particularly serious crimes such as murder and rape, and the courts are not dealing expeditiously with the prosecution of those cases that have been detected.</P>
    <P>To compound the situation, there is a widespread view that the statistics provided by the Minister and the Garda Síochána only reflect a tiny proportion of actual crime levels because so many petty crimes go unreported. Evidence of this was provided in last year's household surveys which showed that a remarkable variety of crimes were not reported and, therefore, are not accounted for in the statistics. In addition, a view was outlined in many of the newspapers that the introduction of the new Garda computer system, PULSE, actually resulted in the non-reporting of a range of different crimes and distorted the statistics.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to comment on these matters. I do not want to make overmuch of them in this debate, but I want to shatter the Minister's complacent attitude that because the statistics are good all is well. There is a palpable feeling on the streets, not only in our main cities but in towns throughout the country, that serious crime is on the increase and that people are more vulnerable now than ever before. We must respond collectively to this problem, but the main burden in this regard falls, in large measure, on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with one or two issues that arise directly out of the provision before us. I welcome the expansion of the law in relation to the possession of stolen property. The Minister's proposals strengthen the law in that area and it is important that people in possession of stolen property would be required to provide an explanation of how it came into their possession. There is a growing feeling among some people that as long as they do not commit the crime, there is somehow an acceptability about receiving the proceeds of crime. That must be firmly and absolutely stamped out and the Minister's proposals will address that matter.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the opinion that the &ldquo;turning a blind eye&rdquo; approach people take to goods they receive &ndash; they do not want to know their origin or provenance, they are merely happy to get a bargain &ndash; should also be addressed. If people who feel themselves innocent because they merely paid below the odds for an item they received are called to account, it will exert major pressure on the market for stolen goods and, hopefully, put pressure ultimately on those who thieve and rob with alacrity.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment now on section 28 which deals with the possession of false documentation and makes specific inclusion of the possession of passports or tickets in the offence to be created. The Minister indicated that this might be expanded further in relation to certificates from his Department. It is clear that he has been considering this provision since it was published <Col N="267" /> because he is already talking about making changes in the area about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>It is our obligation to ensure that genuine refugees arriving in the State are not criminalised. We have international treaty obligations to welcome and provide shelter and succour for those who are defined under the UN convention as genuine refugees. We have had similar debates in the past but it strikes me that there may be genuine refugees whose only means of escape from persecution might be by means of possessing and using false documentation, either passports or travel documents. Surely we are not going to criminalise those people when they arrive in this country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister will respond by saying, &ldquo;Certainly not. Refugees will not be affected.&rdquo;  However, until somebody is declared to be a refugee they are not a refugee; they are, in the words of the Minister, an &ldquo;illegal immigrant&rdquo;. I am concerned that, before they are designated as or found to be refugees and while their cases are still being processed and they are still categorised as illegal immigrants, people could, if they possess false documentation which might have been necessary for their very survival, be guilty of a criminal offence. I do not doubt that we will deal with this issue on Committee Stage but I would like the Minister to comment on it in general terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to section 6 which strikes me as being extremely broad in its scope. I underlined the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo;, which is included in the section and which, perhaps, saves it somewhat. Not being a legal person, even the Bill's definition of &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; as &ldquo;without a claim of right made in good faith&rdquo;, does not clarify the matter to my satisfaction. If a Minister for Public Enterprise, for example, was given a variety of valuations for a share deal and rejected a low valuation in favour of a higher one, if people were at a significant financial loss as a result of the Minister's choice and if the charge could be made that the selection of the higher valuation was arrived at to promote the popularity of the Minister or the Government, would the Minister's action be dishonest and would the Minister who caused a material loss to a citizen by that mistake be guilty of an offence under section 6? I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Section 48 creates the offence of concealing or disposing of facts, for example documents, which would be important in the investigation of a crime. In the case of a Garda investigation of fraud, I welcome the fact that there would be a legal obligation on any person to preserve documentation which would be critical to the proper and conclusive investigation and that it would be an offence to dispose of such documentation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 53 which proposes the orders for restitution. This area has caused me concern for some time. We all believe that where an individual citizen has been harmed or deprived <Col N="268" /> of the use and value of his goods or money, the perpetrator of the theft should, where possible, be required to make restitution. That is an important principle.</P>
    <P>A parallel principle appears to have grown up in the courts without any statutory basis. There is a growing practice of district justices requiring a contribution of an arbitrary amount decided by the judge to the court's poor box &ndash; some judges do this with great frequency. A suspended sentence is then applied to the perpetrator. This could broadly be described as a form of restitution as the poorest members of society benefit from these contributions. However, this is not a good practice and is not statutorily regulated. The Minister should have a position on this practice and if it does not have a legal basis it should not be tolerated. If we wish to have restorative justice the Minister should bring forward proposals to that effect and we should debate them here.</P>
    <P>A matter which is of great concern to me was touched upon by Deputy Shatter. Article 34 of the Constitution requires that justice shall be administered in courts &ldquo;established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public&rdquo;. Just as this House is required to sit in public so, in all but exceptional cases, are the courts. A case was reported in many newspapers today on which the judge imposed a gagging order. He banned the mention of anyone connected with the case or even their occupations or the nature of the offence.</P>
    <P>It is worrying when things like this happen. There must be an extremely good reason why matters cannot be debated, judgments made and arguments heard in public. This is one of the fundamental strengths of the administration of fair procedures in our courts. We have heard of decisions being made in judges' chambers. We must make it clear &ndash; and I hope this can be done in the House today &ndash; that the provisions of the Constitution regarding the open administration of justice must be done and seen to be done. I join Deputy Shatter in asking the Minister to be clear and unambiguous on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are fears that in some cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse when we are all anxious to preserve the anonymity of the victim, that this practice will be used to protect the anonymity of the perpetrator. We have seen courageous victims waive their rights to anonymity so that perpetrators can be named. Not all such cases relate to sex offences. Last year a case involving a tax matter was held<i> in camera</i>. There must be a clear standard and policy and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a responsibility to make that clarification. I hope he will do so at the conclusion of this debate. If clarification of the procedures for holding courts <i>in camera</i> requires legislation then let us enact it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad provisions of the Bill. I look forward to engaging with the Minister in constructive dialogue on Committee Stage and I <Col N="269" /> hope the general points I have made today will be responded to when the Minister concludes this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the key provisions of the Bill, whose main purpose is to enact a modern statutory court to cover all offences of theft. With this objective, the Bill consolidates the law in this area by repealing earlier legislation, particularly the Larceny Acts of 1861, 1916 and 1990. It updates and re-enacts some of the provisions of these statutes, as well as providing for matters not adequately covered by legislation.</P>
      <P>In a broader context, this Bill is one key element of the Government's programme to put in place a better criminal justice system. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to be congratulated on his vigour and determination in bringing forward much innovative legislation. This year we debated the Sex Offenders Bill, the Human Rights Commission Bill, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, the Equal Status Bill and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill. This is only part of the work emanating from the Department this year. Extensive new initiatives have also been brought forward in the child care area. I am confident the Government will build on these new measures in the policies it implements in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister that he has obtained Government approval for the construction of a further 700 closed prison spaces with support facilities. The provision of a number of specialised facilities and services for offenders has also been approved by the Government. I welcome the fact that it is committed to completing the prison building programme. For decades, the Irish prison system has been starved of investment with the result that the culture of the revolving door was endemic to alleviating over-crowding.</P>
      <P>The Government programme includes a commitment to provide 2,000 extra spaces over its five year life span &ndash; an objective it will achieve. The Government recognises that prison alone is not always the best punishment for criminal activity. That is why I welcome the budgetary provision of £4 million for the year 2000 towards Garda youth diversion projects. This programme is set for further major expansion as an additional £16 million will be made available under the national plan. There is general agreement that there can be considerable benefits for individuals who participate in such projects. The report of the national crime forum highlighted the need to invest in the prevention of crime, particularly juvenile crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the national development plan, £302 million will be spent on funding for national youth work organisations in relation to projects designed to develop young people as effective members of their communities; provision of youth information centres to provide easy access to information on youth services and welfare; provision of funding to the <Col N="270" /> young persons' facilities and services fund to support the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, significant drug problems; funding for special projects for disadvantaged youth aimed at facilitating the development of the social education of youth at risk of drug abuse, juvenile crime, homelessness, early school leaving and marginalisation and the establishment of young early intervention programmes and substance abuse awareness programmes for young people at risk of early school leaving or who have low educational achievements. Garda youth diversion projects target young people under 18 years who are seriously at risk of becoming involved in the drugs and crime cycle or are already involved in crime or who are likely to drop out of the educational system prematurely or who are unable to participate in other youth activities due to behavioural difficulties. These projects will ensure that action is taken to offer training, education and negotiation skills. They will also help divert young people away from becoming involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>This Government has also done much to promote equality in society as well as implement many measures to help those who suffer from drug addiction. Within the international arena, it is working closely with its European counterparts to combat international drug trafficking as well as halting trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive legislation represents a fundamental and total reform of the criminal law legal system relating to fraud. It also demonstrates the seriousness with which the Government views the damage fraud does to society. The Bill remedies deficiencies in our legal framework, most notably the Larceny Acts, 1861-1990, and updates and modernises our statutory code covering the area of fraud. It is designed to deal with present day realities and will tackle white collar and computer related crime.</P>
    <P>Changes are also being made in the law relating to the investigation of offences under the Bill and for the carrying out of trial procedures. It includes measures designed for the protection of the European Communities' financial interests from fraud and corruption as well as putting in place broader protection for the euro. It creates a new offence of theft which will consist of dishonestly appropriating property without the owner's consent and with the intention of depriving the owner of it. The benefit of this new definition is that it will encapsulate in a single offence acts that currently make up separate offences such as larceny and embezzlement. The penalty provided for conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine and imprisonment for up to ten years.</P>
    <P>There will be an updating of the existing offences of burglary, aggravated burglary and the possession of certain articles for use in the course of, or in connection with, certain offences. The maximum penalties for conviction on indictment <Col N="271" /> will be an unlimited fine and penal sanction of up to 14 years. There will also be an offence of handling stolen property consisting of receiving or undertaking to assist in the retention, removal, disposal or realisation of stolen property, knowing or being reckless as to whether the property is stolen. The penalty for conviction on indictment will be an unlimited fine or up to ten years' imprisonment or both. New offences of forgery and counterfeiting to replace existing law in these areas will be created. The offence of counterfeiting will extend to counterfeiting euro notes and coins even before these are in circulation.</P>
    <P>There will be new offences of fraud and corruption relating to the financial interests of the European Community. The purpose of this will be to ensure the combating of fraud affecting Community revenue and expenditure including the misappropriation or wrongful retention of Community funds. Other matters covered in the Bill concern the investigation of offences of fraud and dishonesty, including a provision for the granting of search warrants and for orders requiring persons to produce documents and other materials. This can be enforced where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that such materials may constitute evidence for the commission of an offence. The search warrant and production order provisions will apply to any offence under the Bill that carries a penalty on conviction of at least five years. The benefit of a production order over a search warrant is that it avoids the necessity for the use of the more intrusive search warrant provision and the consequent disruption it may cause to business.</P>
    <P>There will also be changes to trial procedures. Included in the Bill are provisions for jurors to be provided with transcripts and other documents to assist them in their deliberations. I support this important legislation that updates the law on fraud and ensures greater efforts will be made to defeat white collar crime in the future. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the legislation. There is a need to bring the law up to date in the area of fraud, theft and dishonesty and the Bill attempts to itemise the various offences which amount to fraud or dishonesty. Existing law does not deal adequately or in sufficient detail with all the possible offences in this area and the penalties that apply do not reflect the modern society in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 2 outlines a wide range of theft-related offences that are being redefined or defined accurately for the first time in law. These include theft, making a gain or causing loss by deception, obtaining services by deception, making off without payment, unlawful use of a computer, false accounting, suppression of documents, burglary, robbery and possession of articles with intent to commit burglary. This list of offences reflects the <Col N="272" /> modern society in which we live and they are matters that were not accurately dealt with in previous legislation. Almost 85% of all indictable crimes committed involve burglary, fraud or larceny. Outdated legislation in this area is unacceptable. By dealing with the reality of the offences that exist, the legislation in this area will be significantly improved.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in detail to some of the offences I outlined. For example, making off without payment was not clearly defined in past legislation. The Bill permits any person to arrest without warrant any individual in the act of committing the offence of making off without payment, for example, in a restaurant or a shop. A garda will be permitted to arrest with reasonable cause and the penalty will be up to £3,000 or two years in prison. I welcome this provision. It will give the Garda more definite powers in this area. In the past the Garda had to give warnings in relation to much of what would be considered petty crime. However, gardaí will now have more definite powers and direction to act in this area.</P>
    <P>The unlawful use of a computer was not covered in detail by previous speakers. I am extremely concerned about this matter and I ask the Minister to clarify a number of aspects. An increasing number of homes in Ireland use computers on a regular basis. This is aside from the increased use of computers in the business world and with regard to e-commerce. It will be an offence now to dishonestly, within the State or outside it, operate a computer with the intention of making a gain for oneself or a loss for another person. How will this work in terms of making it an offence to operate a computer outside the State for the purpose of dishonestly making a gain for oneself? I am interested in the Minister's response in that regard.</P>
    <P>If somebody in Italy sets up a website to sell leprechauns in Ireland, can that person be arrested or penalised if he or she commits a crime under this legislation? I welcome the proposed unlimited fine that can be imposed if the person can be located and there is also a potential prison sentence of up to ten years. However, I am confused about this area, particularly in relation to offences inside and outside the State. There is so much computer use where tracing the user is complicated. There is no point including an offence in legislation if the penalties cannot be enforced. I may misunderstand the provision and I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has experienced much difficulty in relation to website domain names where a person used his name on a website and then dishonestly sought payment for the domain name. Will the legislation cover that type of dishonesty? If one accesses a search engine and types in simoncoveney.com, one will get a message that is abusive in relation to the party I represent. However, if one types in simoncoveney.ie, one will get my website. There is an obvious dishonest intention in terms of asking me to purchase <Col N="273" /> simoncoveney.com to prevent somebody dishonestly abusing privilege in this area. Will such a case be covered by the legislation or does the Bill need to be amended to ensure it is addressed? I realise that, to some extent, this matter is covered in the e-commerce legislation, but it is also relevant to the dishonesty and fraud aspects of the Bill and it should be considered.</P>
    <P>Regarding credit card purchasing <i>via</i> e-commerce and over the Internet, many people in Ireland are afraid to shop over the web unlike in the United States where between 30% and 40% of all shopping is now done over the Internet. People in Ireland do not have the confidence in the system that one's credit card number will not be used dishonestly after it is given and payment is made over the Internet. I ask the Minister to clarify this aspect because the explanatory memorandum contains only a short section on the use of a computer.</P>
    <P>This problem affects charities who try to fund raise over the Internet. This is a much more efficient way of fund raising than knocking on doors. However, charities and voluntary organisations are suffering because people are slow to make contributions <i>via</i> a credit card over the Internet due to the lack of legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding false accounting, the Bill makes it an offence to destroy, falsify, fail to complete documents properly or to furnish misleading accounts for the purpose of making a gain for oneself or a loss for another person. This provision is most welcome because many family businesses, such as farms, rely blindly and entirely on their accountants to pay their taxes and for advice on tax efficient investments, etc. This welcome section will tighten up the law in relation to the advice and guidance people receive from accountants and the work they carry out to maximise take home pay or income, particularly for small firms which do not have their own accountants. This is particularly relevant to farmers and I welcome the changes in this area which I hope will tighten it up considerably.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets out to deal with the offences of forgery and counterfeiting under Parts 4 and 5. Regarding forgery, clear definitions and details are set out regarding the copying or falsifying of documents or instruments for the purpose of dishonest self-gain. This area also needed to be updated. The type of offences envisaged by the section are, for example, the copying of material from tapes or disks or from the web. An example in this regard is the music industry, but I am unclear about how the legislation is relevant to it.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of debate on whether it is legal to download music from the Internet. I am unclear whether websites such as Napster &ndash; which has now moved to join another website and another company and so does not really exist any longer &ndash; are legal. Is one allowed download directly from the Internet? Is one allowed do that from a company within or outside the State? If there is a difference in that regard, it would <Col N="274" /> involve issues of anti-competition. I would like the Minister to comment on that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill. There is massive forgery of CDs and cassettes. One only has to walk to certain parts of the capital or the southern capital, from where I am come, to see forgeries on sale. This undermines the lawful demand and supply market and must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>There are also forgery problems in regard to purchases made over the Internet by credit card. People are not confident about giving their credit card details over the Internet. This must be examined in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill defines and covers the offence of counterfeiting money in quite substantial detail. This is particularly relevant at the moment as we move towards a common currency in Europe. The introduction of the euro will expose Irish people to the threat of criminals who counterfeit money from all over Europe. We will no longer just have to worry about Irish people counterfeiting the punt, but will also have to deal with organised crime gangs engaged in substantial counterfeiting operations outside Ireland. The exposure to that crime will increase significantly as a result of this. I am very pleased to see this area dealt with comprehensively and to see the penalties of ten years in prison or an unlimited fine. That is very welcome. This must be stamped out from the beginning of the introduction of the euro; otherwise, we will be heading down a very dangerous path.</P>
    <P>However, due to the severity of the penalties, we must be careful not to convict people who mistakenly have counterfeit money. I am not sure that people will know how to recognise the euro at first. People who mistakenly find themselves in possession of counterfeit money need to be dealt with sympathetically, particularly during the introduction phase of the currency.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to enjoy complimenting himself on the reduction in the overall crime figures in the Garda Síochána annual report of 1999. I agree with him that the incidence of burglary and larceny seems to have reduced, which I welcome. I compliment the Garda on achieving improved results.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on his recent announcements in relation to CCTV. That will significantly aid the Garda in its fight against petty crime, street violence and, in particular, burglary and larceny. That is a very welcome development. The sum of £12 million is a significant amount of money to commit to this. I would like to see it extended further, as the project proves to be a success over time, as I am sure it will.</P>
    <P>However, I remind the Minister that there is no real accuracy in commenting on crime figures unless one looks at the circumstances in the country at the time. As prosperity continues, unemployment falls and incomes rise, it is not unexpected for larceny and burglary rates to drop. We should ask ourselves if they are dropping sufficiently rather than whether they are dropping at <Col N="275" /> all. It would be very strange and worrying if, as Ireland became wealthier, the number of people stealing to keep themselves financed increased. We need to put this into context.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's reference to the Prison Service, I welcome the increased number of prison spaces planned, particularly the 150 new spaces in Cork prison. It is the most claustrophobic prison I have visited for both prison officers and prisoners. The people working in Cork prison, who recently invited the Minister to a function, greatly appreciate the announcement of 150 new spaces. One or two of the prison officers referred to the Minister as the supreme leader. While that might have been tongue in cheek, it indicates their desperate need for extra space and their relief at finally getting it.</P>
    <P>However, I was very disappointed the Minister did not refer to the need to prioritise rehabilitation within the prison system. We must not be satisfied to continue to provide more and more prison cells in which to lock up more and more prisoners. Instead, our priority should be to reduce the number of criminals who need to be taken out of their community and put behind bars. This is particularly the case for young offenders and many of the offenders involved in petty crime associated with drug use.</P>
    <P>The percentage of people released from prison who end up back in the prison system a short time after being released is unacceptable. They are being failed by our prison system and our court system. Between 60% and 70% of people who leave prison end up back there. That is an outrageous statistic when we continue to build more and more prison spaces. It costs over £50,000 per year to keep a person in prison. Even from an economic point of view, if one wants to be cold about it, it makes sense to invest massively in rehabilitation to try to reduce the number of people who reoffend after they leave prison. We must target, in particular, young first time offenders because they are the easiest people to rehabilitate. Unfortunately, that is not happening to a sufficient extent.</P>
    <P>This begs the question of how much of a priority the drug court process is for the Government. That process will start on a pilot basis in January, which I welcome. I have already asked the Minister if he will consider extending that across the country. I would appreciate correspondence on that. The drug problem in Dublin is different to that in other urban centres around the country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall crime figures mentioned by the Minister, I want to refer to Deputy Howlin's statement that 38 murders were committed last year. Unfortunately, that figure is likely to increase for this year. While the overall crime figures may be down, serious crime, such as murder and rape, seems to be increasing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a major assault on white collar crime. It is timely and welcome legis<Col N="276" /> lation. My constituency has been blighted by high unemployment and disadvantage, which have had consequences for crime levels. A perception has grown that the poor and disadvantaged are punished severely while white collar criminals get away free. This legislation will do a great deal to address this serious problem, which is one more of perception than substance.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Coveney's comments. Uniquely, he is fresh blood in his party and he does not adopt the usual Opposition clichés adopted by his colleagues when they attack the Minister and his fine record of achievement in terms of reducing crime, increasing prison spaces and improving Garda numbers. These were the basic demands people made of us prior to the general election of 1997. Our promises to deal with their concerns were largely responsible for our election to Government. Those who canvassed at that election will recall the significance of the crime issue. I will not criticise the previous Government other than to note that the public was calling for action.</P>
      <P>The Minister has delivered, both legislatively and in terms of resources and logistical improvements. The figures speak for themselves. The Minister has implemented a programme that was set before the people. He has been criticised for not introducing zero tolerance. Perhaps it was a useful slogan at the last general election, but if consideration is given to the legislation and the ever tougher regime the Minister is putting in place it will be clear that there is in practice a policy of zero tolerance.</P>
      <P>This important legislation adds to the growing reputation of the Minister and his Department in terms of legislative output. It is an unsurpassed record and is one for which the Minister and his officials rightly deserve credit and acclaim. It is not often we get to praise public officials, but in terms of productivity, the officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deserve a pay increase because they have introduced an enormous quantity of legislation. While I am not indolent I would not like to work there because the officials are working at break-neck speed on complex legislation and are producing the goods.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to produce a modern statutory code in the area of fraud and theft offences. To this end it consolidates and simplifies existing statutory provisions in these areas, some of which are over a century old and have in some cases become convoluted and overlapping in their treatment of similar or identical offences. While I welcome the Bill, it has been a considerable time since the publication of the Law Reform Commission report and other reports on which it is based. The report on the law relating to dishonesty was published in 1992 and that of the Government's advisory committee on fraud in 1993. It is inadvisable that the updating of the legal code in such important areas should be subjected to such protracted delay, for whatever reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The need for regular and speedy law reform is driven in many areas by the demands of a rapidly changing and ever more sophisticated economy that is growing with globalisation. It is eroding the old fashioned notion of sovereignty, with which the British are obsessed. In this connection the Bill's provisions regarding computer and other white collar crime are most welcome. It is a legislative first in this country.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Bill is in its underpinning of support for a digital, knowledge-based and growing e-commerce economy. This digital revolution will provide the prosperity and jobs for succeeding generations. I advise Esat Digifone and other companies in a private capacity and I have discovered that the development of the digital platform is perhaps one of the most important areas in our business life. Few companies can ignore it.</P>
    <P>We must jealously safeguard our success in this area and protect the basis of it. The number of computer-based crimes reported to the Garda is increasing at a rate of 100% each year. That is a startling figure. It is necessary to act and strengthen the law to prevent this. Hackers and code crackers have the potential to wreak havoc unless caught and punished severely.</P>
    <P>Confidence is the essential ingredient in e-commerce. Without confidence in the systems, and their security, it collapses. Acting as I do for Esat Digifone, I do not wish to be unfair to Eircom, which has gone through a difficult period. The impact of the crashing of its system and the interception of the e-mail system it promotes and sells to the public was hugely damaging to the company in terms of customer confidence. Activities of this kind must be stopped. Unfortunately it is not easy, but we must work on it.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses many of the concerns of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, especially with regard to computer crimes. Irish companies such as Baltimore Technology have become world leaders in developing and selling the business applications of the new technologies. Systems security is a vital selling component in new technology and software products. In this regard, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, should be congratulated on introducing the Copyright and Related Rights Bill. As a convenor on the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I played a part in pushing the Bill through the House. Many of Deputy McManus's colleagues were very concerned about some of its provisions. We are entering new territory in this digital area and some people have misgivings about the powers being enacted to address the problems involved, including the shifting of the burden of proof. We know that the Internet and the web allow for fast copying and the easy transgression of copyright and rights people hold because they have innovated and created a product.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill contains new provisions relating to theft and dishonesty. I am happy that <Col N="278" /> deceptions and unlawful use of computers is to be properly and specifically criminalised. A new sense of theft consisting of interfering with the property rights of an owner is now created, which supplements the existing provisions relating to the physical taking away of property.</P>
    <P>Part 3 broadens the circumstances in which offences relating to stolen property are deemed to occur. The handling, possession and withholding of information relating to stolen property are now comprehensively treated. Part 4 updates the law on forgery, which at present goes back to the Forgery Act, 1861. The definition of what constitutes an instrument is substantially broadened and updated to take account of modern business practices. Is the Minister satisfied that the definitions are sufficiently comprehensive to include instruments under e-commerce systems, such as those containing encrypted signatures, or has this been adequately provided for in e-commerce legislation produced by the Government?</P>
    <P>Part 5 provides against the counterfeiting of notes and coins, including those of the euro, even before they come into effect. That is a proper and prudential provision by the Minister. Deputy Coveney referred to fraud. The counterfeiting of notes will be a very serious problem with the euro. There has been a startling increase in the number of fake dollar notes in circulation around the world. The need to protect the euro from counterfeiters, who are always busy, will be a problem for the European institutions. Confidence in the euro will increase once the notes and coins are in circulation. People will then realise it is a real currency.</P>
    <P>It is important to deal with fraud. Deputy Coveney mentioned organised crime syndicates which operate on the Continent of Europe. It is not a surprise that since the Berlin Wall came down a panoply of organised crime syndicates have appeared in the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc states. I worked in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary and I am aware of the insidious and dangerous criminal networks which operate out of those territories. It is important to safeguard against them. Some of our domestic fraudsters would find their ingenuity, diligence and ability to organise themselves, produce counterfeit notes and become involved in serious commercial fraud surprising. It is startling, for example, that two thirds of the IMF loans advanced to Russia when it needed money for investment purposes disappeared into thin air.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Bill includes measures which are necessary to discharge our European Union treaty obligations and provides for the protection of communities' financial interests. Corruption by public officials is also covered. This, together with the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill which was recently before the House, will considerably strengthen the law in respect of this type of white collar crime. It will also act as a deterrent for those who wish to subvert our valued tradition of public service probity.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Boylan would agree that over <Col N="279" /> the past three years the House has come through a difficult and traumatic period as a result of the establishment of the public tribunals at Dublin Castle. Members often do themselves a disservice by not pointing out the probity and honesty that has pervaded this House and our national institutions over the years. Although recent events are disillusioning to those involved in politics, it must be pointed out that only a small minority of people have brought the name of politics to a low ebb. It must be reiterated by all parties in Government and in Opposition that the majority of people who serve and have served in this House have done so on the basis of probity and public service. The public can be cynical. We see this in the low turnout at election time. We must, as practising professionals, point out the probity and honesty &mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference is appropriate because we are talking about a Bill which deals with corruption by public officials. That is germane to our work. We are public officials, albeit elected ones.</P>
      <P>Part 7 of the Bill deals with the investigation of offences and contains a new provision whereby persons may be compelled to produce documentary and other evidence which the relevant authorities may reasonably believe contains evidence of wrongdoing or the concealment of wrongdoing. This is a sharper and more subtle instrument than the blunt one of a search warrant on which the authorities have had to rely to date. This is important because it allows gardaí and others to deal with commercial larceny and white collar crime.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this new provision, I have one quibble with the severity of the penalties proposed. I ask the Minister to take this on board when he refines the legislation as it moves through the House and the Seanad. A fine of up to £1,500 or 12 months in prison or both for failure to comply with a production order seems lenient in view of the financial magnitude of many white collar crimes. I ask the Minister to reconsider this. Such a fine is a drop in the ocean when one considers the type of financial fraud which can be perpetrated against financial institutions or the State, such as false claims for European subsidies. If we want to take on the corporate sector or senior executives of companies, we must ensure the sanctions sting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strong perception, although it is wrong, that criminals from disadvantaged communities are punished and sent to jail while white collar criminals get off lightly or scot-free. A strong penalty must be imposed. Every day random judgments are made in the District Court by district justices and stiff sentences are imposed on people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Yet <Col N="280" /> people look at the tribunals, for example, and believe that no one will go to jail. It is important to deal with that perception. A fine of £1,500 or 12 months in prison is not enough. We need to apply stronger measures in this area.  </P>
    <P>It is interesting and noteworthy that the Government is producing legislation on corporate enforcement. There are three agencies involved in corporate enforcement, the office of corporate enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners and the Companies Office. We also have a new enforcement officer. These agencies must ensure that companies comply with company law. We are also introducing criminal offences and proper criminal sanctions. However, we would not need an office of corporate enforcement if serious sanctions were imposed on white collar criminals. If the legislation the Minister is contemplating included severe prison sentences, it would not be long before the corporate sector got its act together.</P>
    <P>As regards the money laundering Bill, a burden a proof is now required before a person can open a bank account. It is vexatious for law abiding citizens. I opened a bank account recently in my constituency. People are now required to produce a driving licence or passport before opening a bank account. Many people are annoyed at this, particularly if they know the bank manager. However, it is important to comply with such regulations. The bank must be confident the person lodging the money is who he or she claims to be.</P>
    <P>Part 8 of the Bill deals with the trials of offences. Section 54 deals with the provision of information to juries. In many cases white collar crime is extremely complex, intricate and sophisticated and the provision of detailed information to juries, such as charts, diagrams and transcripts, will help in dispensing justice in long complicated trials. When I was a reporter I attended the Circuit Court in Naas in County Kildare where complicated and difficult fraud cases came before perplexed juries. Prosecuting gardaí would allege that an individual had defrauded a company of £12,000, £20,000 or £60,000. It would be impossible for the prosecuting counsel to convey to the jury the intricate detail of how the fraud had been perpetrated. This was commonly seen when one reported these cases. Quite often, I felt quite guilty reporting a case where somebody had been released because the jury simply could not get their heads around the prosecution case. It was tragic that people who were clearly fraudsters, who perpetrated a fraud against somebody or a company, walked free simply because the jury could not absorb the complicated financial information.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is forging ahead. He has an enviable reputation with regard to the legislation he produced. History will judge him and his Department to have supervised a great period in terms of the legal reform that occurred. No matter who comes after him, he or she will find it very difficult to surpass him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry. I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. It has been a worthwhile discussion. I agree with the last speaker, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in his reference to the Members of this House. Having been a Member for more than 13 years, I have the highest regard for the Members who are hardworking, dedicated people of integrity holding the highest principles. Unfortunately, we were let down by some very senior people who brought disgrace to the good name of this House. It is only right and proper that these people should be exposed, that the tribunals currently in operation in this city should continue and that every last penny of the fraud in which these people were involved is detected. They should be brought to a final and full conclusion and appropriate and proper penalties applied so that nobody will ever again be tempted to carry on in the manner in which these people did. I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>In the broad thrust of this Bill, we are talking about white collar crime. We should be very thankful it is not rampant. Occasionally people in positions of trust have been caught in crime, people involved with credit unions and perhaps the banking institutions, where customers would deal with them on a one to one basis in a very confidential manner and place their trust in them and discuss their very private matters with them. I agree with many of the speakers who said that the deterrent is not sufficient. There is a type of person, obviously with a split personality, whom one meets in everyday life. They are the nicest people to meet. They are highly placed in the various organisations in which they work but behind that same public image, there is a person who is probably under pressure, living beyond his or her means who has succumbed to the temptation to commit fraud. When it starts, it gets out of control and we are talking in terms of hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
      <P>However, there is only one way to prevent such crime and that is by implementing some form of deterrent. A period of 12 months imprisonment is not a sufficient penalty in a case like that. Fines of £1,500, as the last speaker said, are not deterrents. People will weigh up the options and decide it will be worth it if they can get away with a couple of hundred thousand pounds for the sake of 12 months imprisonment or a fine of £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Howlin raised earlier, the Minister should note that there is an outrageous attitude now in many of our courts where the media are being instructed not to report the name of the accused person. An accused cannot have these matters dealt with in private. Will there be public ridicule? Yes, and perhaps there will be a downside for the families, which is regrettable. There is nothing we can do about that. I regret that but if a person is caught, prosecuted and sentenced then the public are entitled to know the identity of that person. I cannot understand the circumstances of the most recent <Col N="282" /> case, but it caused outrage yesterday when strict conditions were applied by the presiding judge. Not only was the person's name not to be mentioned but neither was his profession to be mentioned. Who is he hiding? We discussed this matter in the House before. It is time the Judiciary did its job and left the media to do its job which is to report. The public must know. Then crime will be stamped out. However, if there is to be a hidden face in our approach to crime, we could be on the slippery slope and that is not the road we want to go down. I know the Minister does not either.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ordinary, every day crime about which people are concerned and the role of the Garda, I have the highest regard for the Garda. We have a marvellous police force doing exemplary work but often its work is thwarted, good investigative work, tracking down crimes that may not seem very serious to other members of the public but which are a serious matter to the victims of it. The Garda brings the culprit to court where the criminal receives a minimal fine or three months imprisonment and will be out in a month. That is not a deterrent. A fine of £50 is not a deterrent. The sentence must be appropriate to the crime. More recently, sentences for very serious crimes, which were handed down in my county to people who were not native to my area caused outrage &ndash; it just happened that the Circuit Court sat there. A sentence of three years imprisonment was imposed for a crime where a daughter, a marvellous young person, had the courage to say what had happened in her own home and what she had suffered.</P>

      <P>While I accept your ruling, somebody has to draw attention to what is happening. There is outrage. You are aware of that too. However, I hope the Minister will take note of my comments and I hope these decisions will be appealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Garda, I have a figure of 756 indictable offences for the Cavan and Monaghan constituency. That is quite a low figure in comparison to the rest of the country. The detection rate is 55%. That bears out what I said about the role of the gardaí and the marvellous work they do. On the matter of gardaí on the beat, if there is a Garda presence in the community it will stop other crimes. There is respect for a Garda on the beat and his presence is a deterrent. However, and I have raised this matter at another forum, <Col N="283" /> gardaí are being tied to their barracks doing office work. That is not what they are qualified for and not what they entered the Garda force for &ndash; to sit behind a desk stating whether a person is qualified for a licence, or filling in applications forms for gun licences. That can be done by people who do not necessarily have the qualification of a garda. A clerical officer would be quite suitable and the gardaí that are so needed and are so short in numbers would be freed up. People say that when the gardaí were on the beat walking the streets, there was respect for law and order. We must get back to that old-fashioned manner of maintaining law and order.</P>
    <P>In relation to everyday housebreaking, it is traumatic for any family to wake up in the morning and find that their house has been burgled. It happened in my neighbourhood recently in a business premises where the person hid and was inside when everything was locked up. I have no doubt that the gardaí will find the person responsible. However, as the gardaí have said to me umpteen times, when they go to court with all the work done, a judge will decide on the basis of a crime being a first offence and will apply the Probation Act. That is nonsense. People know when they are doing wrong. If criminals are duly sentenced and fear and respect the law, then the job of the gardaí will be made all that much easier.</P>
    <P>With regard to people making their escape across the Border, we must have full co-operation with the RUC with regard to detection and<i> vice versa</i> when we are dealing, for instance, with people coming south from Northern Ireland for three or six months until things cool down. The Border cannot be a means of escape for people who have committed serious crime. If we approach it in that manner, I have no doubt we can succeed. I fully support the measures the Minister has put before us and I reiterate what the general public is saying &ndash;  that they are not satisfied, when people are apprehended, that sufficient deterrents are applied.</P>
    <P>If there is a scarcity of places in our institutions in which to hold young people, it is for the Minister to ensure that there are sufficient places. Good work is being done in Loughan House and skills are taught to young people. That is vitally important and may help to get them back on the right track. I am aware of two cases where an excellent woodwork teacher encouraged people to develop a skill they did not realise they had, and I believe they will be very successful. Such training while in detention is very important for young people. At the same time, we cannot turn places like Loughan House into hotels. While those in detention can benefit from training programmes, the regime must be such that they will not want to go back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill, the purpose of which is to consolidate the law relating to dishonesty and fraud, including white <Col N="284" /> collar and business fraud. At the bottom end of business, in small companies, the amount of fraud detected was about 2% &ndash; unfortunately in this area fraud is not detected and prosecutions are rare. That is important for certain areas of business. Instilling an ethos of honesty and accountability in business is also very important. The fact that the Minister is updating the Larceny Acts of 1960, 1990 and the 140 years old 1861 Act is very important.</P>
      <P>The victims of crime must also be considered. In Sligo-Leitrim the 30% detection rate for indictable offences is the lowest in the State. The Border region has the highest national occurrence of repeat household burglaries at 21%. Over 70% of assaults committed in this region involved personal injury, the highest percentage in the country. In Sligo-Leitrim in 1999 there were 659 indictable offences with a detection rate of 30%. I have the highest regard for the Garda Síochána who do extraordinary work, but much depends on the co-operation of the public in identifying problems.</P>
      <P>Parents are concerned about how safe it is for young people to go out and enjoy themselves at the weekend without fear of being harassed or attacked. At the same time many elderly people living alone are living in fear. That is very sad because the young and the old are the most vulnerable in society, and in rural Ireland there are large numbers of elderly people who have a great sense of independence and love to live on their own. It is a difficult problem. I know much has been done in terms of providing personal alarms and so on, which is very important, and that the Minister has encouraged investment in the security of elderly people in their own homes. It is important that he should promote that. Community Watch is an invaluable service which involves neighbours in an early detection system. Elderly people can be charged for that. The Minister should consider the possibility of providing that service free of charge. Private companies can be funded by health boards, but services like these should be far more accessible. The fact that the Minister is providing funding for locks and other security devices is also important.</P>
      <P>Parents need to be assured that when their young people go out at the weekend they will not be mugged for no apparent reason. Flash points for violence include fast food outlets where people converge late at night after pub closing time. The question we should be asking is whether pubs and night clubs serve alcohol to people who are already intoxicated. Being a vintner, I realise the importance of a sense of responsibility in the trade. It is important that the laws relating to licensed premises be observed. I saw the advertisement on television yesterday for the Christmas anti-drink driving campaign which is being carried on in co-operation with Northern Ireland and that is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parental support and co-operation with the Garda Síochána is necessary when it is discovered that children have been intoxicated or have been <Col N="285" /> involved in street violence. It is important that somebody should talk to parents in such cases because they can go on the defensive. To solve problems at an early stage and help to put children on the right road, it is very important to have parental involvement in the corrective measures because, although we have the Garda Síochána, Castlereagh Prison and the setting up of the Prison Service, in which the Minister was involved, putting someone in prison is not always the answer. It is also important to have gardaí available in sufficient numbers at critical times, for example, at weekends and after night club closing times. That is also important in the context of court appearances.</P>
    <P>Consultation with local authorities is vital. I was disappointed that CCTV cameras were not being considered for Sligo because I heard the Minister say in a radio interview how successful they are. The Minister, with local chambers of commerce, should promote these cameras where he feels they are necessary and give adequate funding to install them in large urban areas because, as he correctly stated, they have been very effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill relates also to public order. It deals with theft, obtaining services or making a gain by deception, unlawful use of a computer, false accounting and so on. I am glad this Bill embraces the latest technologies. Small crimes are generally detected, but white collar crime within business is problematic. The Minister should make available tax concessions to people in business who invest in security systems because the cost of security systems is substantial and security pays, whether it is in a night club or anywhere else. If there is a hold-up, video evidence means there will be traceability and it can be very beneficial in a court prosecution.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to update and consolidate the law relating to dishonesty and fraud. Unfortunately there is a considerable amount of dishonesty. In the past people had a sense of honesty, wherever it came from, whether from religion, their general upbringing or what they learned within the school system. Dishonesty is learned at a very young age. If people feel their dishonesty is condoned, the seriousness of their dishonest acts will gradually increase. Living in an era of massive economic wealth, we must realise that honesty and propriety are the backbone of the State's success and we must instil proper values and standards at an early age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 658 indictable offences were detected in Sligo-Leitrim where the detection rate is 30%. Detection is very important but prevention is equally so. We must not ever forget the victims of crime. It can be very difficult for victims to go into court to make statements and be cross-<Col N="286" /> examined. The victims can often feel that it is they who are on trial. We must reassure them that the law exists to support them.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that old age pensioners who wish to remain living in their local areas are guaranteed State protection and we must provide every possible resource to them to facilitate that. The Minister should consider providing increased funding for the purpose of investment in locks, doors, alarm systems etc. I appeal to him to pay particular attention to the very young, the very old and victims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to what has been a very interesting debate on this important Bill. I said at the outset that the Bill sets out clearly, for the first time, the law on dishonesty to replace the often confusing distinctions that exist in the current law relating to larceny which derives from the common law and from the Larceny Acts of 1861, 1916 and 1990. This new clarity will benefit everyone involved in the criminal justice system. I venture to suggest that it will be seen by those engaged in crimes of dishonesty as removing the opportunities which may currently exist for sowing confusion about such matters as whether a larceny has really been committed or whether any particular person may be guilty of larceny or handling. Bringing clarity to the law will also help to ensure continued confidence in its operation.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes new offences to replace existing offences, including larceny and embezzlement as well as matters not properly covered at present. There are also measures to assist in the investigation and prosecution of such offences. The Bill contains an entirely new offence of theft to replace the current range of offences in this area. Under the Bill, theft will consist of dishonestly appropriating property without the owner's consent, which means adversely interfering with the proprietary rights of the owner, and with the intention of depriving the owner of the property, whether temporarily or permanently. This differs significantly from the current law relating to larceny which requires physically taking away property with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. This has presented evidential difficulties for the prosecution in proving the various elements of the offence. In addition, it gave rise to the requirement to specify separate offences for different types of stealing. Thus, we have such offences as embezzlement, obtaining by false pretences and fraudulent conversion, to mention a few, to cater for other types of stealing.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains other offences to deal with dishonest behaviour not covered adequately by existing law, including making a gain or causing a loss by deception, obtaining services by deception, making off without payment, unlawful use of a computer with the intention of making a gain or causing a loss and false accounting. These are aimed at types of behaviour which may have become more common in modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The Bill re-enacts, in an updated form, the existing offences of burglary, aggravated burglary and robbery with maximum penalties of an unlimited fine and/or up to 14 years imprisonment for burglary and up to life imprisonment for aggravated burglary and robbery. The offence of handling stolen property is also largely a re-enactment of the current position and is committed by a person who receives stolen property or undertakes to assist in its retention, removal, disposal or realisation knowing it to be stolen or being reckless as to whether it is stolen. A departure from the current position is that stolen property includes property which has been unlawfully obtained otherwise than by stealing.</P>
    <P>An improvement on the current law on stealing and handling is the inclusion of a new offence of possession of stolen property. This is to cater for difficulties which can arise at present where a person is found in possession of stolen property but it is not clear whether that person has stolen it or whether he or she is a handler. This is an important distinction because of the fact that both offences are mutually exclusive. The real difficulty in such situations is that the Garda know the property is stolen and know that it was in the possession of the individual concerned but have difficulty determining whether he or she stole or received it. The creation of a new offence of possessing stolen property will remedy the situation by providing that a person will be guilty of possession where he or she, without lawful authority or excuse, possesses stolen property knowing it to be stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen. If the Garda can prove either of the other offences, which carry heavier penalties, they are free to charge them. At any rate, the later provision in the Bill for alternative verdicts will ensure that the Garda are not hamstrung in their choice of charge.</P>
    <P>Those parts of the Bill dealing with forgery and counterfeiting re-enact in modern form the current offences contained in the earlier Acts which are being repealed. The counterfeiting provisions also provide for protection against counterfeiting of euro notes and coins even before these are issued. Other new provisions are contained in the part of the Bill relating to the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, which are mainly designed to tackle fraud and corruption.</P>
    <P>In addition to provision for the granting of search warrants the Bill contains a number of innovative measures to assist in the detection of offences of dishonesty. One of these is the section allowing the court to make orders for the production of evidential material, which is a less intrusive way of obtaining evidence than the use of search warrants. In terms of the trial of offences, a new provision will allow a judge to provide information to juries in the form of documents, charts and transcripts to assist them in their deliberations. This will be especially helpful <Col N="288" /> to a jury in complex cases, particularly those involving fraud.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and Howlin expressed concern about section 6. Deputy Shatter referred, in particular, to the broadness of its provisions and cited the example of business ventures which simply go wrong and which may result in aggrieved parties seeking to rely on this section. Taking on board his concern, I assure the Deputy that in spite of his misgivings, the inclusion of the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; is intended to address this matter. I will listen to any suggestions the Deputy may have in regard to how the section might be improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also raised concerns about the application of section 7 in certain circumstances. Obtaining services by deception is, to some extent, a feature of modern life. Service providers have found themselves left without any apparent remedy in some situations in which people have failed or refused to pay for services obtained. The section clearly requires a person to dishonestly obtain services, with the intention of obtaining a gain or causing a loss to another, before a remedy can be obtained under the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to section 51(4) and asked why separate takings are limited to three and why the period covered is limited to six months. The rationale behind this is to ensure some proximity in terms of goods which are stolen and in terms of time between the separate takings. It will also ensure that proceedings for stealing offences will commence within a reasonable time which will clearly be advantageous for both the witnesses and the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to a recent Supreme Court case regarding the practice of judges to place review dates on their sentences. While this issue is not directly relevant to the Bill before the House, I assure the Deputy that it will be carefully examined. The prison service Bill, currently being prepared in my Department, will contain provisions relating to a parole board. The Deputy will see the detail of that after the Government approves the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked me to outline where the Bill's provisions depart from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. I am sure he recognises that the recommendations of the commission followed from the consultation paper on the project and the report recognises the difficulties in trying to frame legislation to respond to the problems it identified. When the recommendations are examined in the context of preparing the Bill to give effect to them, there must be some modification to ensure the terms of the Bill are workable and practical and pass the test of proportionality. I assure the Deputy that the Bill gives effect to the report of the Law Reform Commission in substance, even if it departs from the letter of some of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin also raised the provisions of section 28 which deals with custody and control of certain false documents. I am considering further the list of documents which should be <Col N="289" /> included. I categorically state there is no intention to penalise refugees &ndash; the section is clearly aimed at persons who have a dishonest motive over and above any genuine fear of persecution if returned to the country from which they have fled.</P>
    <P>The issue of justice being administered in public was raised, though it is not directly relevant to the Bill. There are constitutional provisions in this regard, as well as legislation to restrict reporting in certain circumstances. There may be occasions when the courts feel there should be restraints in other cases in the interests of the administration of justice. Such occasions do not arise very often and where they do there are procedures for challenging such orders. Members of the House will know of occasions in the past where this type of order has been successfully challenged.</P>
    <P>Deputies have correctly pointed out that detailed examination of the Bill can take place on Committee Stage. I look forward to debate on amendments which may be put forward. Deputy Coveney asked about pilot drug courts, which will be implemented in the north inner city of Dublin in January, and asked if they can be extended to Cork. I will certainly give favourable consideration to doing that at the earliest possible opportunity. It is important that the courts should be available in affected parts of Cork.</P>
    <P>Such a major reform of the law will obviously give rise to calls for additional measures to be included or for clarification on certain matters. I have endeavoured to give Deputies a reasonable guide to the Bill, providing more detailed explanations where it appeared necessary and attempting to reply to issues raised by them. I have no doubt that there are many other issues which I have not touched upon or addressed as fully as Deputies would have wished. This is unavoidable given the nature of the Bill, which is quite complex in parts.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the fact that I did not have the opportunity of going into the provisions in greater detail should not be taken as an unwillingness on my part to meet the concerns of Deputies. I will certainly examine amendments tabled by Deputies and assure them that if I am convinced the Bill can be improved by their inclusion I will be only too pleased to accept them.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, there is never sufficient time at this stage in the consideration of legislation to answer all concerns regarding the Bill, which is comprehensive and complex. There will be time on Committee Stage to go into detail in explaining the intention and effect of each section, each of which is important in its own right, and I very much look forward to doing so.</P>
    <P>I again thank Deputies for their contributions which were quite valuable and incisive.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an díospóireacht a oscailt ar an Dara Chéim den Bhille, a thugann deis dúinn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht). Tá díomá ar an Aire nach féidir leis bheith i láthair, ach beidh sé ag súil leis na tuairimí uilig a chloisteáil ó na Teachtaí.</P>
      <P>Tá sé luaite mar sprioc i Ráiteas Stráitéise na Roinne Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán &ldquo;leanúint de thuilleadh forbartha a chur chun chinn, go príomha trí chláir agus scéimeanna na Rinne féin agus na gcomhlachtaí atá faoina coimirce, a mhéid a bhaineann le cúrsaí teanga, soisialta, fisiciúla agus eacnamaíochta sa Ghaeltacht, agus de phríomhachta na Gaeilge agus a cultúr gaolmhar a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht&rdquo;. Is ceann de na scéimeanna a chuirtear san áireamh anseo, an scéim tithíochta atá mar ábhar an Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>Is í príomhaidhm an Bhille ná leasú agus leathnú a dhéanamh ar Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) chun iad a dhéanamh níos oiriúnaí don lá inniu. Tá sé seo thar a bheith tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht, go háirithe sa chomthéasc nár reachtaíodh aon Acht ó 1979 go dáta. Cuirtear san áireamh sa Bhille nua chomh maith cinnithe a rinneadh le tamall anuas maidir le cúnamh atá ar fáil faoi na hAchtanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929-1979, íocann an Roinn deontais chun tithe nua a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus chun feabhsúcháin a dhéanamh ar thithe cónaithe atá ann cheana féin. Chun cáilíocht a bhaint amach ní mór d'iarratasóirí gnáthchónaí a bheith orthu sa Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge a bheith mar ghnáth-theanga <Col N="291" /> labhartha acu féin agus ag a dteaghlaigh. Caitheadh £1.55 milliúin faoin scéim i 1999, méadú 14% ar 1998. Sa bhliain 1999 fuarthas 1,348 iarratas faoin scéim, méadú 31% ar líon na n-iarratas i 1998, agus críochnaíodh 127 teach nua maraon le 707 cás eile a bhain le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin.</P>
    <P>Bhí méadú ar líon na n-iarratas i 1999 de bharr gur féidir feasta cúnamh i leith teas lárnach i dtithe a fháil faoin deontas feabhsúcháin. Tá sé seo an-tábhachtach i gcás seandaoine atá ina gcónaí leo féin sa Ghaeltacht mar ní raibh teas lárnach i mórchuid de na tithe sin cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Níor méadaíodh na deontais feabhsúcháin le fada an lá, ó 1985 chun a bheith cruinn, agus bhí áthas ar an Aire a fhógairt le déanaí, nuair a bhí an Bille seo á fhoilsiú go raibh méadú substaintiúil déanta ar na deontais feabhsúcháin agus sláintíochta faoi na hAchtanna le héifeacht ó 24 Deireadh Fómhair i mbliana. Chomh maith leis sin méadaíodh an deontas i leith méadú speisialta do chuairteoirí i mí na Samhna 1999. Bhí sé thar am na deontais seo a mhéadú agus deontais réalaíocha a chur ar fáil agus tá mé thar a bheith sásta go bhfuil sé sin déanta anois.</P>
    <P>Cheadaigh an Rialtas scéim ghinearálta de Bhille chun Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) a leasú i Meán Fómhair 1999 agus os bhur gcomhair tá an téasc den Bhille mar atá sé dréachtaithe ag Oifig na Dréachtóirí Parlaiminte don Rialtas. Is Bille réasúnta gearr é &ndash; 14 mhír atá ann san iomlán. Ba mhaith liom anois léargas a thabhairt ar na príomhfhorálacha atá ann ina n-ord chróineolaíoch.</P>
    <P>Mar is iondúil sa reachtaíocht, is é alt 1 an foráil míniúcháin. Tá mínithe le fáil anseo ar an bpríomhAcht, sé sin, Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929 agus mínithe ar na hiar-Achtanna idir é sin agus 1979. Tá tuilleadh ábhair tís ar siúl in alt 2 chun an léiriú ar an bpríomhAcht a leasú trí shainmhínithe éagsúla. Forálann alt 3 gurb í an Ghaeltacht chun críocha na nAchtanna ná na Limistéir Oifigiúla Gaeltachta a shonraítear faoin Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956. Mar thoradh ar an leasú seo, beidh sainmhíniú oifigiúil amháin i bhfeidhm don Ghaeltacht, rud atá ag teastáil do na Ranna Stáit agus na Comhlachtaí Stáit a bhíonn ag plé leis an nGaeltacht ar bhonn rialta. Ar ndóigh bhí na hAchtanna i bhfeidhm i bhfad sular leagadh síos na Limistéir Oifigiúla Gaeltachta i 1956. Nuair a déanadh é sin, leanadh chun críocha Achtanna na dTithe le haitheantas do na seanlimistéir a leagadh síos i 1929. Aon deontas nua a tugadh isteach áfach tar éis 1956, bhí sé teoranta do na Limistéir Oifigiúla agus ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ba rud ciallmhar é sin. Beidh na deontais uilig faoi na hAchtanna teoranta do na Limistéir Oifigiúla anois &ndash; is beag cás a bhí i gceist lasmuigh de na Limistéir sin ar aon chuma.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht faoi leith ag baint le halt 4 agus 'sé sin, nach mbeidh gá d'iarratasóirí ar dheontais do thithe nua a bheith ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht fad a bhíonn an teach á thógáil. Tugann an leasú áiri<Col N="292" /> the atá i gceist anseo deis do theaghlaigh le Gaeilge atá ag iarraidh filleadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht teach a thógáil dóibh féin sa Ghaeltacht roimh theacht abhaile dóibh agus a bheith fós i dteideal deontais. Roimhe seo bhíodh ar iarratasóirí a bheith ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht ag am an iarratais agus nuair a bhí an teach á thógáil. Leigheasann an leasú seo an fhadhb a chothaigh sé sin d'iarratasóirí áirithe. D'fhéadfaí a rá go bhfuil an leasú seo tráthúil anois os rud é go bhfuil go leor teaghlaigh le Gaeilge ag filleadh ar an nGaeltacht de thoradh an borradh eacnamaíochta atá againn faoi láthair. Ar ndóigh ní bheidh sé i gceist aon deontas a íoc go dtí go mbeidh gnáthchónaí ar pé iarratasóirí a bheidh i gceist sa teach nua sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 4 freisin leis an deontas le haghaidh díon tuí a dheisiú nó a athsholáthar. Tá an deontas seo le fáil sa Ghaeltacht ó 1990 ach ní raibh aon soláthar chuige ins na hAchtanna go dtí seo. Mar atá ráite agam cheana, measaim go bhfuil an teach ceann tuí mar íomhá thábhachtach de thraidisiún agus radharc tíre na hÉireann &ndash; is nasc láidir é lenár stair agus ag an am céanna cabhraíonn sé le tionscal na turasóireachta. Tá áthas orm a rá gur mhéadaigh an Roinn an deontas áirithe seo dhá uair ó 1990 &ndash; i 1996 agus arís i 1999.</P>
    <P>Níl i gceist ag alt 5 ach cead a thabhairt don Aire na mionathruithe a bhíonn ag teastáil ó am to ham ar leagan amach an Fhoirm Iarratais a chur i gcrích gan Ionstraim Reachtúla a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Leagann alt 6 amach nach mbeidh deontas ceadaithe i leith na n-oibreacha céanna atá ag fáil cúnaimh as airgead poiblí nó as airgead ó Institiúid do na Comhphobail Eorpacha. Cé go raibh coinníoll cosúil leis seo ins na hAchtanna cheana ní raibh na Comhphobail Eorpacha luaite sa choinníoll áirithe sin. Níos tábhachtaí fós, is deontas i leith an tí féin a bhí luaite cheana in ionad deontas i leith oibreacha áirithe. Tugann an leasú seo deis don Aire deontas feabhsúcháin a íoc i leith tí má tá cás tuillteaneach ann, fiú go mbíonn deontas i leith oibreacha eile sa teach céanna i gceist chomh maith &ndash; b'fhéidir, ón mBord Sláinte nó ón gComhairle Contae. Cabhróidh an leasú seo le daoine i ndrochthithe atá ag fáil cúnamh tithíochta sóisialach ó na heagrais éagsúla sa mhéid go mbeidh siad ábalta tairbhe deontais faoi na hAchtanna Gaeltachta a fháil chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Athleagann alt 6 amach freisin riail na 7 mbliana &ndash; 'sé sin an tréimhse fanta idir deontais fheabhsúcháin &ndash; ach go mbeadh eisceacht ann i gcás cúlchoire nó fearas dóite breosla sholadaigh a fheistiú &ndash; eisceacht atá ann cheana féin ó Acht 1979, chomh maith le heisceacht i leith oibreacha riachtanacha chun téarmaí Acht Seirbhísí Dóiteáin, 1981 a chomhlíonadh, atá á chur isteach anois don chéad uair.</P>
    <P>Tugann an eisceacht bhreise seo deis do theaglaigh Ghaeltachta atá ag coinneáil foghlaimeoirí Gaeilge deontas feabhsúcháin a fháil i leith oibreacha bainteach le sábháilteacht dóiteáin sa teach <Col N="293" /> gan fanacht tréimhse 7 mbliana ó fuair siad deontas feabsúcháin cheana.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 6 freisin discréid don Aire deontas a dhiúltú i gcás tithe a fuair deontas ó fhoinsí eile, mar shampla, ón Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil nó faoi Chlár cosúil le Leader, sa tréimhse 7 mbliana roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 7 leis an gcumhacht chun rialacháin a dhéanamh faoi na hAchtanna i leith oibreacha déanta le cúnamh deontas ar bith faoi na hAchtanna. Roimhe seo bhí an chumhacht sin teoranta d'obair a bhain le tógáil, feabhsúcháin nó méadú.</P>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar alt 8, agus le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, beidh an tAire in ann rialacháin a dhéanamh chun deontais faoi na hAchtanna a mhéadú i leith oibreacha ar oileáin Ghaeltachta amach ón gcósta. Faoi Act na dTithe (Gaeltacht) 1979 tugadh cead don Aire deontais faoi na hAchtanna a mhéadú 50% i gcás oileáin Ghaeltachta. Tugann an leasú áirithe seo solúbthacht don Aire chun na deontais sin a mhéadú suas go 200%. Tá an méadú sin i bhfeidhm cheana féin i gcás deontais do thithe nua agus deontais feabhsúcháin.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 9 an chumhacht don Aire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, deontais tógála nó feabhsúcháin nua a cheadú faoi na hAchtanna. Is deontais iad seo nach bhfuil clúdaithe cheana féin faoi na hAchtanna agus d'fheadfadh a leithéid a bheith i gceist má tá gá leo sa Ghaeltacht amach anseo.</P>
    <P>I gcás alt 10 féadfaidh an tAire deontais a ghnóthú ar ais má fuarthas iad trí chalaois, trí mhífhaisnéis nó trí ró-íocaíocht. Ba chóir go mbeadh an chumhacht seo ag an Aire cheana, ach ní mar sin atá, agus tá leigheas á chur ar an easnamh sin anois.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 11 an chumhacht don Aire chun na riaráistí i gcás iasachtaí tithíochta atá ag seasamh amach a ghnóthú ar ais, a díscríobh nó a laghdú de réir mar is cuí, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais.</P>
    <P>Leagann alt 12 amach go mbeidh na freagrachtaí uilig bainteach le haisíoc iasachtaí faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) le n-aistriú ó Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí go dtí an Roinn Ealaíonn, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán. Chinn an Rialtas go ndéanfaí é seo nuair a bhí an scéim den Bhille á ceadú acu. Is í an Roinn a bheidh freagrach as seo amach as na hiasachtaí atá ag seasamh amach.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 13 aisghairm ar na hAchtacháin a luaitear sa sceideal don Bhille, sin é, aisghairm forálacha a mbaineann le deontas seallaí saoire, iasachtaí faoi na hAchtanna, forálacha a bhain le limistéir Ghaeltachta faoi Acht 1929 agus forálacha a bhain le seandeontais nach bhfuil feidhm leo a thuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir dom a lua anseo go bhfuil an deontas do thógáil dara teach curtha ar ceal chomh maith, sin é, an deontas a bhí ar fáil do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht a raibh tithe maithe acu sa Ghaeltacht cheana féin agus a bhí ag iarraidh an dara teach a thógáil. Níl an aisghairm seo luaite go sonrach sa sceideal mar gheall ar an ionadaíocht iomlán déanta ag alt 4 den Bhille seo ar alt <Col N="294" /> 3(7) den Phríomh-Acht a chuireann deireadh leis an bhforáil a bhí ann don dara teach.</P>
    <P>Bhí an deontas do thógáil dara teach agus sealla saoire ar fionraí le blianta agus déanadh cinneadh iad a aisghairm go foirmeálta agus an t-airgead a bhí i gceist a dhíriú ar dhaoine a bhí ag tógáil tithe don chéad uair sa Ghaeltacht. Is fearr ar fad cúnamh tithíochta breise a chur a fáil i bhfoirm deontais méadaithe, rud atá déanta agam sa Ghaeltacht le dhá bhliain anuas.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht na n-iasachtaí a bhí ar fáil faoi na hAchtanna titithe go mór le blianta agus ní bhíonn ach líon an-bheag iarrataisí i gceist. Tógadh an cinneadh na hiasachtaí a chur ar ceal mar nach slí éifeachtach iad a thuilleadh le teacht i gcabhair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go háirithe ag cur san áireamh a laghad éilimh atá orthu, gur suim bheag airgid atá i gceist i gcomparáid le méid agus costas na hoibre riaracháin a bhaineann leo, na deacrachtaí móra atá ann le riaráistí agus cúinsí eile.</P>
    <P>Faoi dheireadh, níl san alt deireanach, alt 14, ach leagan amach gearrtheideal, comhlua agus forléiriú an Bhille.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated last week, it is my intention to provide for tax relief in respect of the historic cost of taxi plates bought by existing taxi licence holders. The price actually paid for a plate will be treated as capital expenditure for tax purposes, similar to where plant and machinery is bought by a business. Accordingly, a capital allowance will be applicable so that the actual cost of a taxi plate can be written down over a period of years, in the same way as applies to plant and machinery. At present, a capital allowance may be claimed over seven years at a rate of 15% of the <Col N="295" /> cost of the asset for each of the first six years, with the final 10% in year seven.</P>
    <P>For example, in a case where a taxi plate was bought for £50,000, the owner-driver may offset £7,500 for each of the first six years against taxable trading income earned in this period and £5,000 in the final year seven. In the event the owner-driver has less than £7,500 or £5,000 in taxable income per annum, or even no taxable income, he or she will be liable to carry forward the unused amount to a later year or years for offsetting purposes.</P>
    <P>The capital allowance may be fully offset against taxable earnings at the marginal rate of tax payable by the taxi drivers concerned. The allowance will be based on the historic or actual cost of the taxi plate. Finally, only the trading income derived from a taxi by the owner may be taken into account in using the capital allowance. In other words, the allowance may not be offset against other income.</P>
    <P>The information I have just given was communicated to the representative taxi organisations at a meeting on Tuesday last between them and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy. The Minister of State is responsible for taxi regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that certain owners of taxi plates will suffer serious financial loss now that the taxi business is being liberalised? Will he reconsider the amendment he is proposing to the Finance Bill to allow capital allowances against income other than the income earned by running a taxi business against, for example, spouse's income? Will he also consider a further amendment which would allow someone who bought a taxi plate, say, two years ago to offset against income earned from an employment prior to that date?</P>
      <P>I am aware the Minister is applying what is now available in respect of plant and machinery to the taxi plate. However, in the interests of fair play, an amendment to the Finance Bill is necessary which is designed to meet the particular need. The Minister would not be over-generous if he allowed this relief against all income, including spouse's income. In the case of recent purchasers who have the biggest loss, perhaps he would allow relief against income earned from other employments prior to the date of acquiring the taxi licence.</P>

      <P>I am willing to consider any hardship cases brought to my attention between now and the Finance Bill. My announcement regarding the allowability of capital allowances against taxi plates was innovative. I am aware that certain people may have some difficulties. I will consider cases put to me, hypothetical or otherwise, where my scheme of capital allowances may not be of any great benefit. I am willing to consider hardship cases and the look-back <Col N="296" /> period, and it is unique to apply this provision retrospectively. However, the principle I am applying to allow for depreciation on a wasting asset is not unique.</P>
      <P>Those who bought taxi plates would have assumed they would be more valuable in the future, therefore, they would have fallen within the category of possible capital gains tax or loss, as the case may be. It is now legitimate to regard this asset as plant and machinery, an asset which will depreciate and not have the same value in the future. That principle is not new. However, my measure is unique in that I am prepared to consider the issue retrospectively.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised interesting questions about other incomes against which relief should be allowed. I will consider cases put to me and make sure that the Finance Bill will incorporate changes to deal with these particular problems. I am sure that neither the Deputy nor I would want to encourage a situation whereby a very wealthy person who may have a lot of income from other sources would be able to offset the capital allowance against that income. For example, it would not be legitimate to offset plant and machinery against the income of a solicitor, barrister or any other profession &ndash; I am not sure if there are barristers in the taxi trade. I am sure the Finance Bill will make allowances for hardship cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that taxi plates have become items of value and have been treated as such by the Revenue, for example, for CGT or CAT purposes, irrespective of what was originally spent on them. Someone who got a plate for virtually nothing 20 years ago thought of themselves as owning an asset worth £70,000 or £80,000. Is there a case, therefore, to be made for compensating those people, irrespective of their original outlay, for the loss in the intrinsic value of the plate, which is clearly now not worth £70,000 or £80,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the Deputy's bona fides in trying to put forward genuine hardship cases. However, if one was to extend that particular principle, in almost all business decisions where people suffer loss, the State would be asked to take up the slack. Let us suppose a small business has to cease trading because a better supermarket opened up in the neighbouring town, of which there are many examples in my constituency, that business which may have been valued at £200,000 a few years ago might now be worth approximately one-tenth of that amount. The Deputy is hardly advocating that the State should compensate for such a loss.</P>
      <P>What happens where a husband is earning a very good income and dies suddenly, I have personal experience of such a case? The State does not compensate that person's widow for the loss of business. Under the social welfare code, that widow may obtain some weekly allowance. I have a lot of experience in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am willing to consider genuine hard<Col N="297" /> ship cases, I do not agree with the principle the Deputy has outlined, if that is what the Deputy is advocating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister really dealing with hardship cases by trawling up cases of even worse hardship from his professional experience? That does not meet the need.</P>
      <P>I know of taxi drivers in my constituency who became redundant, had no job, had their house paid for and remortgaged it to pay for a taxi plate. These plates are of no value now and the jobs will probably not be as lucrative as they might have been. In such circumstances, people have very significant mortgages because that is what they used to fund the purchase of the taxi plate. What the Minister is proposing by way of compensation through capital allowances favours those who are doing well in the business rather than those who are doing badly. Given that the relief will be at the marginal rate, those who are paying at the standard rate will only get relief at that rate. Therefore, it tends to favour the well off. Those who are struggling and paying no tax or very little tax have no taxable income to offset against.</P>
      <P>Approaching compensation through the tax capital allowances formula only favours those who are not hardship cases and does nothing for the hardship cases. Will the Minister bring a proposal to his colleagues in Government to make provision for <i>ex gratia</i> compensation payments for hardship cases where the hardship can be proved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle the Deputy is outlining in relation to deregulation and other losses business people suffer is that the State should step in with a form of compensation. I did not think that was the position adopted by either the Deputy or his party in these matters.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am willing to consider genuine hardship cases in the Finance Bill to see how they can be facilitated by the tax code. It is a separate debate as to whether people will do more or less business in the taxi area as a result of deregulation. There has been more business for everyone in other businesses that have been deregulated and properly run. I do not profess to have any great expertise in the area of taxis, but I am bold enough to state that the living to be made from owning a taxi in the future, in spite of deregulation, will be better than it is now. That has been the experience in all other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation I outlined in regard to capital allowances would put everyone in a better position in terms of their after tax income than is currently the case. Irrespective of whether people made large or small incomes from their businesses in recent years, they are not allowed the cost of the asset they purchased. If a person mortgaged his or her house, he or she is allowed, in terms of expenses, interest on the loan. However, he or she is not allowed, up until now, depreciation on the asset. Therefore, he or she <Col N="298" /> has to fund the repayments or principal out of after tax income.</P>
    <P>The changes I made in respect of capital allowances mean that after tax incomes are higher. We could have a separate debate on whether overall gross income at the top, due to deregulation, will rise or fall, but the net tax positions will be somewhat better. The Deputy is correct in stating that the higher a person's income the better will be his or her benefit at the marginal rate. This applies to all other areas.</P>
    <P>The market was regulating itself in this sector as regards prices. People were paying large prices in the free market in the expectation of garnering big profits. One would not pay £60,000 for a taxi plate if one thought one was only going to make a couple of thousand pounds per annum. That would not make economic sense and I doubt if anybody did so.</P>
    <P>What I am allowing people in terms of depreciation will be of more benefit to them in terms of their ongoing business. The separate question arises in respect of the expected capital depreciation by which a taxi plate might be affected in the future. That will not be the case because taxi plates will not be sold in that way. I will provide an analogy. Deputy Noonan's house, like mine, might have been worth £50,000 15 years ago and it could be worth a couple of hundred thousand pounds today. It might give the Deputy great comfort knowing that but if one wants to buy a new house one is obliged to pay the current market price. A person can only sleep in one bed and live in one house.</P>
    <P>Unless a person involved in the taxi business is going to sell the plate when he or she retires, it is of no particular value to them. However, under my scheme of depreciation, it is of value to them as they continue in business. People do not appreciate that.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that his analogy is not quite fair.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;paid VAT in recent years on the acquisition of a taxi plate has had the value assessed as the market value of the plate at the time. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that this is the case. I put it to the Minister that there is a difference between our positions in so far as the value of the plate has been eradicated or vastly reduced by virtue only of a decision of Government, not because of some act of God, a change in the marketplace or anything of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It arose from a decision of the Government which was necessitated by a decision made by the courts. The consequential regulations had to be put in place on foot of the court's decision.</P>
      <P>Capital acquisitions tax, which is a broad heading for gift or inheritance tax, applies when people die and their estate has to be valued. All their assets are valued and, therefore, if a person owned a taxi plate it would have to be valued. However, if the person who died passed on all his or her assets to his or her spouse, under the Finance Act, 1986, introduced by Deputy Dukes, no inheritance tax is liable to be paid. In addition, probate tax is not paid on a transfer from husband to wife because that tax only arises when death has occurred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have a case in circumstances where a person may have died intestate. As he is aware, under the intestacy laws two thirds of the estate goes to the spouse and one third to the issue. The one third that went to the issue could possibly fall liable to gift or inheritance tax, but not the transfer to the spouse.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan's question, the Government made decisions regarding the regulations put forward by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy. I dealt with the taxation area and I came forward with this concession. That is the scope of the Government's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy development of widening the standard rate tax band has been debated at length in the House and elsewhere since budget 2000. The Deputy will be aware that part of the context for the policy changes with respect to band widening that I introduced in budget 2000 was the Government's target that at least 80% of taxpayers should not be subject to the higher rate of tax. In my statement on budget 2000, I pointed out that one of the chief problems with the taxation system was the low level of income at which single people became liable to the top rate of tax and that single people who were on incomes less than the average industrial wage were paying tax at the top rate.</P>
      <P>The aim of the initiative, on completion, was to reduce the percentage of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax to 17%, or 12% if exempt cases are included. The Deputy will also be aware that the policy of establishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers was supported by the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The social partners also support the target that at least 80% of taxpayers should not be subject to the higher rate of tax.</P>
      <P>I understand that the NESF report to which the question refers deals with the alleviation of labour market shortages, it does not concern taxation matters as such. However, the report, in its references to taxation, indicates &ldquo;support in principle for moving to more individual taxation&rdquo;. It also acknowledges that widening of the tax bands is in itself progressive. To complement band widening, as part of an overall tax reform package, the report suggests that measures be adopted for those on lower incomes and-or all taxpayers equally.</P>
      <P>The data, as quoted in the Deputy's question, on the distributional impact of the band widening does not coincide with what, I understand, is contained in the NESF report on the alleviation of labour markets shortages. It is noteworthy that the data in the NESF report was produced using the ESRI's SWITCH system. The output of that system depends on the parameters and assumptions that are input into it. I am not aware of the parameters or assumptions used by NESF to generate the output. The Deputy will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to outline at this stage the measures that are to be included in my Budget Statement on 6 December next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister correctly pointed out that the NESF report basically deals with labour market shortages. The report states that the home carer's allowance has introduced a new distortion which aggravates the problem of labour shortages by providing a disincentive for a second <Col N="301" /> partner to take up paid employment. Will the Minister comment on that observation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read chapter 6 of the NESF report which is due to be published shortly. That chapter supports the policy of widening the standard rate band and it also makes the case that further measures should be taken at the lower end of the scale and for all taxpayers generally. It further states, quite correctly, that the introduction of the home carer's allowance negatived somewhat the benefit of the widening of the standard rate band which I undertook in last year's budget. I explained at the time that I took that route on foot of a commitment in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. I brought forward the change one year earlier than originally envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not. I understand that 20% and 80% are not the figures in the final report. The Deputy is quoting from figures widely reported in a Sunday newspaper so I am not blaming him for that. The report contains a good analysis of the widening of the standard rate band although the report is about the labour market shortages and not about taxation. The report welcomes the widening of the standard rate band in principle and also refers to the extension of the home carer's allowance and other ways in which the taxation system could increase participation in the labour force. It is all there and it is well worth reading.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of the Irish Road Hauliers' Association who are concerned about increased fuel costs. I pointed out that this Government has never increased the excise duty rate on diesel &ndash; the last increase was imposed in the January 1997 budget &ndash; and that prices at the pumps were responding to market demands.</P>
      <P>A task force on haulage issues was set up under the chair of an official from the Department of the Taoiseach. Officials from my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Public Enterprise, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs are represented on the task force. The task force was asked to consider and draw up a programme of action which recognises the need for a comprehensive and concerted effort by all interested parties in order to address the structural problems of the industry. I understand the work of the task force is ongoing and I believe that a package of measures can be formulated which will address the concerns of the haulage industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to the changes, if any, in the excise duty rates, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not normal practice for the Minister for Finance to indicate in advance of the budget what amendments, if any, he is proposing.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to this question. The Irish Road Hauliers' Association is pleased with the meeting it had with the Taoiseach and myself. The association recognised that excise duties and other forms of taxation are matters for the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time we decided to set up a task force under the chairmanship of an official from the Department of the Taoiseach to progress these other issues. The Department of the Taoiseach is not directly involved in the haulage industry but because the problems of the industry straddle so many Departments this was thought to be the most effective approach. That has been done. The association has made its case, there have been a number of meetings and we must <Col N="303" /> wait until proposals are brought forward. We know what the association wants in the taxation area but it has put forward a number of proposals in the non-tax area. These include additional enforcement staff in the Department of Public Enterprise, a doubling of the existing payment to the association, a grant scheme for hauliers who wish to change their trucks, a limit on tolls charged on trucks using new toll facilities, some form of capital allowances for premises used for parking trucks and other matters. These matters are being considered. The Minister for Finance is only involved in the taxation area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue which, if not handled politically, could cause great difficulty. On its day of protest, the Irish Road Hauliers' Association was very moderate and did its best not to inconvenience the public. The association represents only 30% of hauliers in the country. Not alone does it have to keep its own members in line but it must also be conscious of actions which might be taken by non-members. All the hauliers involved are registered for VAT so a reduction in VAT on diesel would be of no benefit to them. They will need some comfort on budget day. The Minister should not only deal with the excise issue but he should also involve himself in the other issues so that he is in a position to give assurances on budget day and avoid protests before Christmas.</P>

I compliment the members of the association on that. It is a pity their methods are not copied by other protest groups. I am aware that only a percentage of hauliers are members of the association. I have family connections with the industry and I understand the difficulties involved.</P>
      <P>Since all hauliers are registered for VAT a change in VAT rates would be of no benefit to them. At our meeting it was pointed out to them by the Taoiseach and myself and it later became evident in documents published in the press, that our excise duties are low compared with those in other EU countries. A minimum rate of excise duty has been laid down and Ireland is very near to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it quite clear that the question of restoring pensions parity does not arise since it has not been removed. The position is that in June 1997, in its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of those deals, the only change being that there would be a guaranteed minimum increase of 3%, or 2% in the case of any pensioners who had already received an advance payment of 1%.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Some organisations had difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines applied to certain groups of pensioners. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department, along with other Departments, made every effort to ensure that public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>There were however problems due to the fact that some pensioner groups objected to the terms of the guidelines. Those guidelines were framed with full regard to the way that parity had traditionally been applied even before the PCW deals were negotiated and, as such, they excluded pensioners from benefiting from payments such as new allowances, existing non-pensionable allowances being made pensionable for the first time, long service increments which were personal to certain serving groups of employees, post upgradings, etc. Despite this, some pensioner groups sought to have the benefit of such payments applied to them. It would of course have been a breach of parity to do this.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, it was agreed with the unions concerned that the personal long service increments paid under the various PCW restructuring pay deals would be made permanent for serving staff with effect from 1 April 2000. Accordingly, these long service increments are being passed on to the relevant pensioners in the normal way provided that they have the required service on the maximum of the relevant scales.</P>
      <P>The benefit of all relevant pay increases since November 1997 under Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness have been passed on to pensioners.</P>

His letter in reply to my letter to him of 2 November is at variance with a corresponding statement from the Department of Education and Science. A small group of people is being denied pension parity. Retired principals and deputy principals are given the three standard allowances but their allowance as deputy principal and principal is denied. It is an integral part of their salary but it is not recognised. The Minister's statement today and the one he made on 2 November, together with the pre-election promises made in 1997, will do nothing but add to the confusion.</P>

      <P>There may be confusion among certain groups but I am not confused. In the first sentence of my reply I stated that the question of restoring pensions parity does not arise simply because it has not been removed. This was such a difficult area that the previous administration could not arrive at a solution. It did not do anything before the 1997 election when it became an issue. We made that statement. In November 1997 I made the change. I introduced it in the way put forward by the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It was back-dated and I put forward a floor. The public services committee of congress welcomed what I did and said it was in line with what should have been done. It said this was what it had advocated and that it was pensions parity.</P>
      <P>There are some groups that are trying to create a new principle about the term &ldquo;pensions parity&rdquo;. I adopted the position put forward by ICTU and inserted a floor which pleased congress. Subsequently, there were difficulties with some organisations in implementing it but these have been ironed out. However, I accept what the Deputy says that there are some groups who are endeavouring &ndash; I do not mind them doing so &ndash; to create a new, what they would deem to be, pensions parity. I adopted the position put forward by ICTU. It was so difficult that the previous Government could not deal with it. I implemented it and was complimented by congress on doing so. It was in line with what it wanted.</P>

      <P>I am happy to take this opportunity to inform the Deputy of progress across a number of different areas in the conduct of value for money audits. A system of expenditure reviews has been in place since 1997 in accordance with one of the key financial and managerial reforms in the strategic management initiative.</P>
      <P>By establishing the review system as a regular part of their annual cycle of work, Departments are assisted in ensuring the efficient use of the resources. The reviews provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by each programme and a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on the allocation of resources between spending programmes. The reviews are normally carried out by the spending Departments under the aegis of joint steering groups from the spending Departments and the Department of Finance. A steering committee for programme evaluation, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established to oversee the process and to provide an independent assessment of completed reviews. I am making available for the information of the Deputy a list of completed expenditure reviews.</P>
      <P>After three years experience it is now appropriate to consider the future development of the process and my Department is currently consulting with other Departments and offices on proposals for the next phase of the expenditure review process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from the Government's review of its Action Programme for the Millennium, consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche, were appointed last May to carry out a comprehensive value for money audit of the health services to examine the trend in resource inputs versus the trend in service outputs to clients over the past ten years; the trend in demand for health services over the past ten years; the difference, if any, between the trend in the level of contribution to cost of public and private patients <i>vis-à-vis</i> service levels to each category; differentials in output costs across health boards and hospitals including specialties. The consultants have also been asked to make recommendations on the development of a management information system for the health ser<Col N="307" /> vice. The study is expected to be completed in spring 2001.</P>
    <P>All expenditure under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, both EU co-financed and non-co-financed expenditure, will be subject to ongoing evaluation and mid-term evaluation under a number of standard criteria. All evaluations will be required to address five key evaluation questions, namely, rationale, continued relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and impact. The latter four considerations are particularly relevant to the issue of value for money.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The Deputy will also be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General has a statutory mandate for the conduct of value for money examinations under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993. The purpose of these VFM examinations is to provide the Dáil with independent assurance about economy and efficiency in the use of resources by public bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and about how well they evaluate the effectiveness of their operations. To date the Comptroller and Auditor General has published reports on 35 VFM examinations.</P>
    <P>I am also making available, for the information of the Deputy, a list of the VFM reports published to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>At a meeting held on 21 November, the Government approved my proposals for draft legislation on dormant accounts and it will now be finalised by the parliamentary counsel. Officials will also consult with the credit union movement in relation to arrangements that could apply to dormant accounts in credit unions on an agreed basis. I expect that legislation, which will apply to all financial institutions, will be published early in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will define &ldquo;dormant accounts&rdquo; as being any account with no customer initiated transactions in the previous 15 years. The underlying objective of the proposals is to ensure that the funds in these accounts are returned to their rightful owners. Credit institutions and insurance companies will be required to take all reasonable steps to identify the beneficial owners of such <Col N="309" /> funds with a view to repayment. It is only where the owners cannot be traced that the funds will be taken into the care of the State with a right being guaranteed to the beneficial owners or their successors of those funds to seek a refund at any point in the future.</P>
    <P>The legislation will not affect the right to privacy which currently exists between a financial institution and its customers. This will be fully protected under the proposals as no information regarding the original ownership of dormant accounts will be made publicly available or passed on to the State.</P>
    <P>A board of trustees, nominated by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will be set up with a remit to disburse any surplus funds which will be those over and above what will be required to meet possible refunds to owners for charitable purposes, or purposes of societal and community benefit. It is proposed that an independent chairperson will be appointed, along with representatives of community and other groups as well as a senior official from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The funds will be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the trustees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister settle on 15 years as the appropriate term? This matter was discussed on a few occasions in the past and I understood from the Minister's previous responses that he was inclined towards a shorter term than 15 years. Will he define what he means by &ldquo;surplus funds&ldquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors convinced me to set the figure at 15 years. It is the lowest figure in the EU for dormancy. Other countries have similar legislation where accounts are considered dormant if there has been no activity for 30 years or more. The lowest figure we could find was 15 years. Another consideration was that we did not want to apply what could be deemed uncompetitive restrictions on Irish bankers. My initial figure was ten years while the Irish Bankers' Federation wanted it set at 20 years and we settled on 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the period of dormancy is short, the administrative costs will be higher. Many more thousands of accounts will arise with a limit of ten to 15 years than if the limit was 15 to 20 years or more. This was a consideration in settling for 15 years because I want the banks, under the legislation, to bear the administrative costs of dealing with these accounts. They will only remit the total to the National Treasury Management Agency. If a person turns up in time and wants to claim back his or her money, he or she will not apply to the National Treasury Management Agency but to the local bank branch. It will give him or her back the money and that will be subtracted from the sum in the annual return the following year. If I opted for a lower figure, the banks would still <Col N="310" /> have to comply with the legislation but they would not be as co-operative.</P>
    <P>Regarding surplus funds, the NTMA will have all the money that is given. A small amount will be deducted for administrative costs and a small sum will be set aside to cover situations where people turn up looking for their money in banks but the amount of refunds is greater than the amount coming in. The rest of the funds will go to the trustees who will disburse them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 99.99% of the money that goes to the NTMA will be transferred every year to the trustees. A small amount will be withheld in case a situation arises the following year where the banks do not have sufficient money to meet refunds. However, this will be a small proportion of the funds. Over time, all the funds will be disbursed by the trustees. It is a precautionary measure. I hope the legislation will be introduced early in the new year and it can be debated further at that stage. However, all the funds will be disbursed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be clearly laid out in the legislation and there will be a long list of criteria with which they must comply. They will be subject to strict penalties if they do not comply with the criteria. I am sure that during the debate on the Bill Deputies will have some ideas about how it can be improved. However, there will be strict rules with which the financial institutions must comply. They must be satisfied that accounts are dormant and if they do not follow the rules, they will be penalised. The rules will be set out in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Relevant criteria will be also laid out in the legislation regarding the disbursal of the funds by the trustees. It will be for the trustees to disburse the money. They will be appointed by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in consultation with the Minister for Finance. However, it will be up to the trustees to give out the money. It was described recently as another lottery type fund, but that will not be the case.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is not customary for the Minister for Finance to give advance notice of what measures, if any, will be taken in the budget and it is not my intention to break with this tradition.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on a number of occasions, including in the Adjournment Debate on this subject on 18 October 2000, an interdepartmental review group, under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was set up to review the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme. The principal issue of concern expressed by the public in connection with the reliefs under the scheme was, and still is, in relation to the medical criteria. Arguably, the continual pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its valuable reliefs, giving access to tax free cars and motor fuel, in effect, for life.</P>
      <P>The qualifying disability criteria set out in the regulations relate essentially to persons who have severe and permanent physical mobility problems. While the number of potential beneficiaries is unclear, up to 350,000 persons in Ireland could be regarded as disabled to some degree. Not all of them would, or could, use any widened scheme, but the substantial tax benefits make for considerable interest in it.</P>
      <P>As I am on record as saying in the House, I appreciate the difficulties people who suffer from some disability face in coping with every day life. Many people with various forms of disability would consider themselves as having a genuine case for the tax relief. However, given the level of the benefits available under the scheme, the cost is considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas.</P>
      <P>The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 5,400. The cost of the reliefs, excluding the annual road tax costs, in 1999 was approximately £18 million compared to £4 million in 1994. The cost of the scheme, excluding the annual road tax costs, is estimated at £22 million in 2000. The average benefit per person per year is approximately £4,000 on the basis that more than 90% claim in respect of the purchase of a car every two years. Thus, the cost per beneficiary is very high in that benefits apply for life from date of admission. The scheme is not means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental review group is trying to resolve the complex issues involved. I understand that over 250 written submissions were received by the group. Oral submissions were heard over a three day period in early May 2000 and over a two and a half day period in September 2000. All the written and oral submissions are now being examined by the group and I hope they will help in the finalisation of the report. The <Col N="312" /> review group has given no indication yet of when its work will be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not indicated when the review group will complete its work, but when did it start its work? The complicated criteria for the assessment of disability are causing serious problems and delays for many applicants. This aspect more than any other is causing difficulty. While the tax relief is welcome, and in some cases adequate, the delay and torture applicants and their spouses or family members must undergo to establish entitlement causes serious difficulties.</P>
      <P>The motorised grant element is processed by health boards. It is the co-ordination of the two elements that is causing problems. I ask the Minister to review that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have in my notes information on when the review group was set up, but it was at least two years ago. I will give that information to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There is considerable interest in this scheme due to the generosity of the tax reliefs. Once one is in this scheme, one is in it for life. This is a particularly generous scheme. Furthermore, Ireland is unique in adopting a tax based approach to this. Other countries have some form of relief but they are not usually tax based.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of people have been trying to get into this scheme in recent times, but many of them have failed to do so. They then appeal the decision, knowing they will not qualify. That is also delaying matters. I am not saying there is a deliberate campaign to do that, but there has been a campaign to raise this debate over recent years. I have answered a number of parliamentary questions on this and my Department has sent replies on it to Deputies from both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out previously, it is a particularly generous scheme. Perhaps, if we were starting again, we would not go down this particular route. However, I remember that when a Minister for Health proposed some changes to the scheme in the 1980s, all hell broke loose. I have had enough hell breaking around my head in recent times not to want to start that again. I am waiting for the review group to report.</P>

      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, <Col N="313" /> which I attended on 7 November 2000 consisted of the following issues. Under the heading &ldquo;Follow-up to the Lisbon European Council and preparation for the Nice European Council&rdquo; four issues were discussed. These were as follows. In regard to corporate financing, ECOFIN took note of a progress report from the Commission on the risk capital action plan, and adopted conclusions aimed at refocusing and improving the coherence and co-ordination of the various Union financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>In regard to structural performance indicators, the ECOFIN discussion took account of a draft report prepared by the economic policy committee and a Commission communication on this topic. ECOFIN agreed on a global list of indicators, which are to be used to assess progress in social and economic reforms in the areas highlighted by the Lisbon European Council. It was also agreed to submit the economic policy committee report to the Nice European Council, together with a note from the Presidency setting out Ministers' views, especially on the need to identify a smaller number of core indicators.</P>
      <P>With regard to public finances, ECOFIN discussed a progress report from the economic policy committee on the financial impact of ageing populations. Ministers welcomed the report, and approved its publication. Ministers also asked the economic policy committee to continue its work, with particular focus on health care expenditure and tax aspects. ECOFIN agreed to come back to this subject once a year.</P>
      <P>Under the same public finances item, ECOFIN also noted a progress report on the quality and sustainability of public finances prepared by the Commission. The report refers to four criteria for assessing whether tax reforms can achieve a sustainable reduction in the tax burden when still adhering to fiscal discipline. It was noted that these four criteria had not been agreed by Ministers. The Commission acknowledged that this was the case, stating that it used these criteria in its own analysis. It was agreed that more work could be done in this area.</P>
      <P>I would note that the Commission document is generally very positive regarding Ireland. For example, it states that average tax rates on low and middle income earners in Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK are lower than in the US and that marginal tax rates have fallen significantly in Ireland and the Netherlands. It also notes that a few countries, including Ireland, have made some moves towards more active labour market measures. Finally, it observes that the share of public investment spending as a percentage of the total spending is highest in Ireland, Greece, Spain, Luxembourg and Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The framework for exchange rate strategies of pre-accession countries was also discussed and a set of conclusions setting out the broad framework envisaged were adopted. In this respect, <Col N="314" /> Ministers noted the intention of the Swedish Presidency to initiate in 2001 a broad economic policy dialogue, including on exchange rate strategies, between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament and the accession countries. The objective of this dialogue will be to assist the accession countries in their economic accession strategies.</P>
    <P>The final item on the formal ECOFIN agenda was the Commission's proposal to recast the financial regulation for the EU budget. Commissioner Schreyer, who is responsible for EU budget matters, gave a short presentation on the Commission's proposal. The recasting of the financial regulation is designed to modernise, simplify and clarify the day to day rules for implementing the EU budget and the responsibilities of those charged with its implementation. The Council took note of the Commissioner's presentation and asked for examination of the proposal to proceed at technical level.</P>
    <P>Over lunch, the Presidency gave a short debriefing on the Eurogroup meeting which had been held the previous evening. Discussion at lunch also touched upon the possible extension of qualified majority voting to certain EMU articles of the Treaty, macro-financial assistance to the western Balkans and preparation for a meeting between oil producers and consumers in Riyadh.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the above is a very brief summary of ECOFIN's discussions and conclusions. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Council secretariat press release which was issued after 7 November ECOFIN and which contains a more detailed summary of the meeting. I have arranged to supply the Deputy with a copy of the press release, which is also available on the Council secretariat's website.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the agreement among Ministers for Finance in relation to withholding tax on deposit interest? Is he satisfied that Irish banks will have no difficulty complying with the exchange of information requirement, which I understand is part of the agreement?</P>

      <P>The meeting on 7 November did not deal with that topic. It was dealt with in the meeting on Sunday and Monday of this week.</P>
      <P>It was finally agreed at the Feira Council that exchange of information would become the way of doing this. It was decided on 1 November 1997 that a coexistence model would be used, with either exchange of information or a withholding tax. However, in the discussions leading up to the Feira Council, the whole thing was turned around and it was decided we would go the exchange of information route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a period of time during which that can take place. Ireland has said we are going to go the exchange of information route. A small number of countries will have a withholding tax for a period of time. We sat until 3 a.m. last Sunday night-Monday morning trying to agree a compro<Col N="315" /> mise on this. The compromise finally arrived at was that those countries not going the exchange of information route, such as Luxembourg, would have a 15% withholding tax for the first three years, 20% for the next four years and, after those seven years, they would have exchange of information. This is to start in 2003.</P>
    <P>It was agreed, however, at the Feira Council, and at the ECOFIN leading up to that, that this will not come into place until understandings are reached with countries outside the EU, such as Switzerland, which do not have similar provisions. The Luxembourg authorities made it clear that that is part of the agreement. That was also part of the Feira Council conclusions.</P>
    <P>We are going the exchange of information route. I signalled a long time ago that I had no difficulty with either the exchange of information route or a withholding tax. The exchange of information route suits us better, which is why we will adopt that when the directive is put in place.</P>

      <P>I briefly went into the details of what happened last weekend. However, it was also agreed there would be a 75:25 split of the revenue that arises from this. In other words, if country A identifies that deposit accounts there are held by people from country B, the revenue will be shared on a 75:25 basis. The original proposal was for a 90:10 split, but due to pressure that was changed to a 75:25 split.</P>

The IFSC deals with funds from institutions in other countries. That area is not as big a difficulty for us as it is for Luxembourg, for example. It is alleged by some countries that many deposit accounts in Luxembourg are held by individuals in nearby member states. I do not know whether that is correct and neither does anybody else. That has exercised one country in particular for some time. The split of the revenue will be on a 75:25 basis, with the 25% being held by the country in which the deposits are held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The economy should continue to grow strongly over the next five years, albeit at a slower pace than in the recent past. The national development plan which the Government published last year was based on an annual average growth rate of 5% over the period <Col N="317" /> 2000-06. This was based on an assessment of prospective trends in the labour force and gains in productivity and the following assumptions: the continuation of a favourable international environment; the maintenance of the economy's international competitiveness; and the implementation of the NDP to address our infrastructural problems.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the economy grew more rapidly than expected. Labour market conditions continue to tighten while unemployment has fallen below 4%. The reduced pool of available labour, in conjunction with infrastructural constraints which cannot be resolved overnight, will slow economic growth. However, I am confident that with the correct policies we can continue to grow strongly over the medium-term. An updated assessment of economic prospects and projections over the period 2000-03 will be published by my Department on budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure will be published by my Department this Saturday morning, to conform with the terms of Article 28 of the Constitution. On budget day an economic review will be published as part of the budget documentation, together with an updated stability and growth programme, which used to be known as the Economic Outlook. It will be sent to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The figures we projected last year for growth in the economy for 2000 were understated, in line with figures projected by other forecasters. In GDP terms the EU Commission is now forecasting growth of 10.5% for this year, 8.2% for 2001 and 7.3% for 2002. The OECD is forecasting growth of 11% for this year, 7.9% for 2001 and 7% for 2002, also in GDP terms. In the middle of the year my Department publishes its economic review and outlook. In the middle of this year we projected GDP growth of 10.3% for this year, or 8.3% in GNP terms. I will publish revised forecasts on budget day. My budget figures last year were more conservative than were the figures of most economic forecasters. We projected a slow-down in economic activity. For the past five years Ministers for Finance have been projecting a slow-down in activity but it has not occurred. We expect medium term growth to be approximately 5%. Given the high growth rate for this year it can be assumed that the rate for future years will be lower.</P>

      <P>I would like to think that my three and a half years as Minister with responsibility for the conduct of economic affairs has been effective in keeping economic growth at high levels. With the tightening of the labour market, the unemployment rate at less than 4% and with other constraints in the economy, growth will slow. These developments are automatic in a small open economy like Ireland's. Attempts to deliberately slow it down are not on my agenda. It is happening, but it is important for growth in future years that we alleviate capacity constraints, referred to by Deputy Noonan and his party. If we are not in a position to solve some of our infrastructural problems in the immediate future we will have a slow-down. I have no difficulty admitting there are problems that need to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that until recently their priority has been to complete the work arising from the look-back audits of the DIRT liabilities of the financial institutions. The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioners have recently made a report to the Committee of Public Accounts giving details of the total amount of £173 million in <Col N="319" /> DIRT liabilities, including interest and penalties, determined as a result of these audits.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked about the recovery of tax from the individual account holders. Revenue has informed me that the question of underlying tax on concealed income in bogus accounts will now be investigated by them. Given the potentially large numbers of accounts involved, the nature of the investigation requires careful consideration to ensure that the process of pursuing the liabilities is effective in recovering amounts due. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they hope to issue guidelines in the matter early in the new year after their analysis of the issues, including legal aspects, has been completed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the circumstances the figures requested by her are not available at this stage. I understand a small number of individuals have made payments on account to Revenue in advance of the main investigation.</P>

A total of £173 million has been collected in the form of tax, penalties and interest.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have signalled their next business will be to consider how to deal with the underlying accounts. I am not in a position to inform the Deputy on what information they have acquired during the look-back audit.

From my pre<Col N="320" /> vious experience in another profession, if this was to be done in depth I do not know how many thousand man years would be involved. To undertake a proper look-back investigation takes an enormous amount of time.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will draw up guidelines to address this problem. I am sure they will be asked these questions at the Public Accounts Committee sub-committee. A wide number of issues are involved and when the Commissioners have completed their work with the financial institutions they will address them. It is a very complex area. We do not want to arrive at a situation, as the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts said recently, where all the resources are spent dealing with this over the next five or six years and a scandal emerges. All these matters must be considered.</P>

      <P>As I have stated on previous occasions, following the abandonment of the ACC-TSB merger-flotation process, I made it clear to all concerned in the ACC Bank that the <i>status quo</i> could not continue and that it was more important than ever that the bank addresses the need for change in order to face the increasingly competitive marketplace. I still believe that a change in the ownership structure is vitally important to secure the long-term interests of the ACC Bank. I have asked the board to review its position with a view to bringing forward proposals for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the board has endorsed a strategic plan for the future development of the bank and I have received details of this. I have informed the ACC Bank through the chairman that it will have my full support in preparing to meet the challenges of an increasingly competi<Col N="322" /> tive marketplace and in preparing the bank for a change in ownership. I expect to receive a business plan from the bank early in the new year. Legislation is currently being prepared which will include provisions to establish an ESOP for the staff of the ACC Bank, an increase in share capital if required and also enabling provisions which will allow for the sale of the bank in the future. It is intended to publish the Bill early next year.</P>

I also set up a number of things and I put in place a number of changes. The chairman of the ACC Bank, for example, will report to me each quarter and the executives will have more regular contact with my Department. This also applies to the ICC. I wrote to the chairman of the ACC Bank expressing my disquiet that a State-run bank was doing things which were illegal. Banks should not be involved in anything illegal but it was a bit much for a State-run bank to operate in that fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that young people, by virtue of their youth, may not always be overly concerned about putting something by for a rainy day. Often, it is only when we get a bit older and, we hope, wiser that we begin to appreciate the need to accumulate savings for the future.</P>
      <P>As regards incentives to encourage young people to save, there is in place a number of savings schemes operated through An Post and managed by the NTMA, most of which are suitable for the young and not so young alike. These are savings certificates, savings bonds, instalment savings and prize bonds. The returns on these schemes are tax free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as regards very young people, An Post, acting on behalf of the National Treasury Management Agency, operates two savings schemes for children in primary schools. Savings stamps are the more popular of the schemes. The stamps are sold at 50p each to children either directly at post offices or through the schools. The stamps are fixed to a savings card which, on completion, can be used to open a deposit account in the Post Office Savings Bank or to <Col N="323" /> make a lodgement to an existing Post Office Savings Bank account. The savings club is the second savings scheme. Under this scheme, the school operates a single Post Office Savings Bank deposit account on behalf of pupils, with two teachers acting as trustees. The teachers keep a record of the individual amounts deposited in that account by each pupil.</P>
    <P>In addition, other general savings schemes where there is a tax incentive to save include special savings accounts, where a reduced rate of DIRT of 20% applies, and the related special investment accounts. There are also generous tax incentives for pension provision to encourage young people to save from an early age in respect of their retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. The post office savings stamps, which cost 50p, were only 5p when I bought them. That shows inflation has increased. Does the Minister agree that young people are pushing up inflation because they are inclined to spend money as they receive it? Many people do not have money put aside to buy a house. We should introduce new incentives for young people to save so they can buy a house or a car instead of spending their money. The current incentives are not adequate to encourage people to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that young people up to their mid and late twenties do not seem to save to the same extent as my generation or previous generations. That might reflect a change in society. There is evidence to suggest that the savings ratio is falling. However, I always caution against taking too much notice of the savings ratio. It is a residual figure in the national accounts and it cannot be subject to the same criteria, regardless of whether it is exact. It is the figure left over and it has been revised on many occasions by a considerable degree. Young people do not spend as much time saving.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that young people who spend money contribute to inflation. The other argument could be made that they contribute to economic growth. If young people have a lot of money, they are inclined to spend it and this means there is great activity in our towns and villages. It is a separate debate as to whether it contributes to inflation. There is an element of some services inflation but it is a far broader question whether that alone is contributing to inflation. I am considering changes in the budget and the subsequent Finance Bill to encourage people to save on a voluntary basis. We all should encourage the notion, particularly in younger people, that they should save because it is only prudent and good times do not last forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>First, I welcome the opportunity to bring the House up to date on the developments in relation to Egypt and the action taken by the Government to protect our major beef market there. I will also address the matter of the additional controls proposed by the Commission in relation to BSE which will be discussed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin with Egypt. As Deputies know, Egypt is Ireland's biggest market for beef. Last year, for example, 157,000 tonnes of beef were exported there at a total value of approximately £200 million. It is a market which receives and deserves enormous attention from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Bord Bia in terms of supporting the commercial export and developing and maintaining excellent relations with the authorities there on technical and veterinary matters. I have visited Cairo on numerous occasions and have had very useful meetings with Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Goweili, and with the trade minister Dr. Boutrous-Ghali. I cannot overemphasise the importance of the Egyptian market for Irish beef. For this reason, the Government takes very seriously the <Col N="325" /> recent action by Egypt to suspend the issue of import licences to Western European countries including Ireland. The reason they have taken this decision is to allow them take account of the developments within the EU related to BSE and to assess the measures and decisions being taken to deal with that situation. The developments I referred to relate to the situation in certain other member states and not to Ireland's.</P>
    <P>I outlined the difference between our situation and that elsewhere in the EU during the debate in the House last night and the night before. The Government has taken immediate action to deal with the situation in Egypt. To begin with, our ambassador in Cairo has been in daily contact with the authorities there and has outlined the facts of our situation in relation to BSE to the relevant authorities. Senior officials at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will travel to Egypt at the weekend for meetings with senior officials in Cairo. Ireland has an extremely positive case to make on BSE and these officials will ensure that the Egyptian authorities are made fully aware of that face to face.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with the Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Goweili, this morning and have impressed upon him the importance of the market to Ireland, the quality and safety controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees which can be given to consumers of Irish beef. I have arranged to meet him after the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday when a further range of measures will no doubt be put in place within the EU to deal with BSE. Even though these may not be necessary in Ireland, they will help to restore consumer confidence and eliminate much of the confusion which has arisen out of the recent BSE scares in Europe. I have explained this to Dr. Goweili and, as I said, I have arranged to meet him after the European Council meeting on Monday next. Furthermore the Taoiseach will also raise the matter with President Mubarak and is due to talk with him before the weekend. He will also impress upon the Egyptian leader the full facts about Irish beef exports and will ask him to avoid taking definitive action which may damage this trade.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the general situation on BSE within the EU, I outlined earlier this week the background to this and how it has arisen. Clearly, the effect of BSE being found in member states who had not found it up to now, caused a great deal of confusion. The EU Commission made a series of proposals to be addressed at Monday's Council meeting. These proposals include the following: a temporary ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal to all farm animals, a requirement that all animals over 30 months of age are tested for BSE to enhance consumer confidence, a requirement that the current list of specified risk materials which must be destroyed and removed should now also include the entire intestine of bovines of all ages, a purchase for destruction scheme to remove from the food chain all cattle <Col N="326" /> aged over 30 months unless they have tested for BSE to ensure additional guarantees and to rebalance the beef market, a flexible handling of public intervention to address the current drop in producer prices and to raise the advances paid for beef premia from currently 60% to 80% in order to take financial pressure off beef producers.</P>
    <P>These proposals are being examined currently by a number of bodies including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the EU Standing Veterinary Committee, by the various scientific bodies there and by the European Commission in Brussels. The market elements will be considered by the EU Beef Management Committee tomorrow in Brussels at the beef management meeting. The package of measures will be presented then for decision at Monday's Council meeting. The measures proposed have enormous implications, both financial and environmental, and they need very serious consideration. My overriding concern in all of this is to ensure that the health of the consumer is protected. We already had an array of measures in place as I outlined to the House last night and the night before. These have been objectively validated and endorsed by outside agencies including our own Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the EU Commission, the Scientific Steering Committee in Brussels, the OIE in Paris and importing countries. All 60 odd countries importing from Ireland, including Egypt, must see for themselves that our controls are in place, that they stand up and that they are comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to introduce further measures and to commence testing of older cattle from the earliest possible date. I am convinced that consumer protection and confidence are absolute prerequisites for food production and marketing. Once consumer confidence in beef is restored, which should be achieved in the shortest possible time, market stability will return. We have experience of this over the past ten years. Typically, it took some time to return, perhaps six to 12 months but it has returned. It is the tragedy of this situation that, having had difficulty in 1996 and having built up the markets again over the past couple of years, including Egypt, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries, we have this difficulty once more which has rocked consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>However, recent developments have caused serious problems within the market and these can only be dealt with by emergency measures and we need several of those now. Already export refunds have been increased, the APS scheme for cows has been introduced but more is definitely needed for farmers and the industry. I will be pressing in Brussels for appropriate measures which are properly targeted and tailored to meet the requirements of Irish farmers and the Irish cattle and beef industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the primacy being given to consumer health issues. I also thank the Mini<Col N="327" /> ster for having sent to me today information which he promised me at the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine yesterday.</P>
      <P>How widely known were our BSE control measures to export customers before these events happened? The Minister has supplied the House with a list of these measures and has repeated it just now. The Commission has proposed the testing of animals of 30 months and over from next July. Why has the Minister not proposed that we start it at an earlier date? Will the Minister be specific in terms of the approach he intends to take to the Commission's intention to look at the use of intervention mechanisms to support the market, and to the proposals for the purchase for destruction of animals of over 30 months, and does he intend to make any proposals for an improvement of the income support measures proposed by the Commission which, so far, are limited only to raising the advances of beef premium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Our controls are widely known and very widely dispersed in the market place. As Deputies will be aware, it is difficult to get general public awareness through the media because bad news is easier to disseminate than solid concrete news. Bord Bia, through its network in those countries, the trade itself and its agencies, has disseminated the information. There is hardly another country in the world that has as much public support of its industry as Ireland has. At all the trade missions to which I and my predecessor have travelled, including those in third countries, information about those controls are in the hands of the people there. They are widely known, but they are better known to the trade than to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the extra testing, in Ireland we have had controls in place ahead of the other member states, particularly those that have a problem now or whose problem has now been officially declared. The ENFER scientific test has been available in Ireland for some time, and we have been using that on a pilot or random basis. We are now going to crank that up very considerably. There are three such prion tests, and we will be looking for tenders for the cheapest possible one. The cost up to now was 60 or about £50 per test. In negotiations in recent weeks, when we took a decision to increase the level of testing, we brought that down to about £18 per test. Given that we have 750,000 cattle over 30 months of age which need to be tested, at £10 per test that would amount to £7.5 million a year for testing alone. However, that is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem relates to the logistics. This test is done post-mortem and the result is available four hours later. The test is done in the plant. The carcase is subdivided, and each part of the carcase must be followed half a day later. There is a fair amount of logistics attached to the test. Nevertheless, we are committed to introducing it and scaling up the pilot operation that currently exists. <Col N="328" /> No other country in Europe is as advanced as we are. At the last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers a decision was taken to introduce this test on 1 January for animals at risk and then to extend it from 1 July. The reason 1 July was decided upon was that some countries did not have the laboratories, the testing equipment or controls that we already have in place in Ireland. We are cranking up this test very quickly and we hope to have it in operation once the logistics have been sorted out. We are in discussions with the company that carries out the test, the farming organisations and the trade with a view to putting it in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be before 1 July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be before 1 July because we already have the random test in place. It is a question of scaling it up quickly. We hope to have it comprehensively in place early in the new year. The company has informed us that it can scale testing up to several thousand per week very quickly. That will not be the case in many other countries because they will not be in a position to do that. We are in a position to do it, but there are logistical problems within the plants. It is not as easy as it seems.</P>
      <P>Market supports will be critical. The proposals before us for next Monday refer to advances from 60% to 80%, and to intervention. Intervention already exists as a safety net but it brings in only about 73p a pound, which is of no use to the farming community. I will look for realistic and effective intervention because it is estimated that if this problem continues there will be in excess of 200,000 head of cattle to be disposed of between now and Christmas, about 75,000-80,000 tonnes. A mechanism would be needed to utilise that. Currently that mechanism is intervention. However, what is needed is intervention at a realistic price, intervention without weight restrictions, because intervention with weight restrictions would be ineffective in Ireland, and other supports for farmers who have lost a considerable amount of money because the price of steers has been reduced by about 10p a pound and the price of cows by about 28-30p a pound.</P>
      <P>The very serious matter of waste disposal must be confronted by the local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Proposals on food safety mean eliminating further risk material. There is a &ldquo;buy and destroy&rdquo; proposal in the event of a testing mechanism not being available. We simply do not have facilities for such disposal because already fallen animals have been brought into the chain. There is a proposal for a total ban on meat and bonemeal in animal feed. There will be additional testing in addition to the matter of waste disposal. The meeting of the Council of Ministers on Monday will be an extremely important one for the Irish industry and for the future of the beef industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister has said on a number of occasions that the Egyptian market is so important, and given that the problems in Europe developed in the past two weeks, what contact did he make with his counterpart in Egypt in the past two weeks in an effort to avert this problem? When and where does the Minister propose meeting the Egyptian Minister of Agriculture? When and how will he contact the President of Egypt? Does the Minister accept that the price of beef has been slipping for a number of weeks? What action has he taken in that time? Is he aware that factories have stopped killing? Has he received any information, and can he give us the information as it now stands with regard to the situation on the ground? Which factories have stopped killing since yesterday? Does the Minister accept that farmers are facing serious hardship, with Christmas coming up, and that some factories may not open until after Christmas? What immediate action does he intend to take to assist families and workers at the factories who may be in danger of being laid off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This difficult matter arose in France because two animals from an infected herd, even though the animals in question were not infected, got into the food chain. Suddenly France had to confront this problem. The French agriculture Minister proposed a strategy to address the problem but President Chirac had other ideas which he broadcast on public television. The matter received a great deal of publicity and France and Spain took unilateral action on the issue. The Spanish action affected Ireland because a ban was imposed on the breeding of females over 20 months of age. It was decided at the meeting of the Council of Ministers that no further unilateral action should be taken and that a Union-wide approach should be adopted. Consumer confidence subsequently stabilised, although it was not fully restored.</P>
      <P>Germany's problems created a huge scare once again and emotions ran high. The Egyptians monitored the publicity of the issue in Europe in which its media took an interest and yesterday an abrupt decision was made to suspend import licences. We did not receive any advance warning. Our ambassador in Cairo was in daily contact with the Egyptian authorities. It is normally necessary to obtain a decree in Egypt to get a complete ban but that did not happen. A decision was taken to temporarily suspend the import licences. Bord Bia personnel, who are currently in Egypt, are keeping in daily contact with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintained close contact with farming organisations and industry representatives and it was generally felt that it would be preferable not to go to Egypt before a problem arose because that could have created difficulties which did not exist. I spoke to Dr. Wali, the Egyptian agriculture Minister, this morning and he informed me that the Egyptians do not have a problem with Ireland and that the decision to suspend licences is a temporary measure until the confusion in Europe is <Col N="330" /> resolved. He informed me that he would await the outcome of the Council of Ministers meeting due to be held on Monday. I agreed to meet Dr. Wali and his senior officials following that meeting. I do not know when that meeting will take place because the weekend falls on different days in Egypt. It is the weekend in Cairo today and tomorrow and nothing is happening there. In addition, this is the middle of Ramadan. Even if I were to go to Egypt today, I would not be able to meet anyone. The Council of Ministers meeting will probably go on through the night on Monday but I intend to travel directly to Cairo when it concludes. Arrangements have been put in place for the Taoiseach to have a telephone conversation with President Mubarak over the coming days.</P>
    <P>I outlined the information received from Bord Bia yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the effect that 30,000 tonnes have been processed in the factories in recent weeks. I have not received any indication that factories have stopped slaughtering this week but they have been processing in expectation of future markets. The French, Italian and Egyptian markets have dried up although exports which are <i>en route </i>to Egypt will continue. Problems should not, therefore, be experienced for up to two weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The factories continued to take in cattle and process them up to this week, although that may seem unusual in the face of such difficulties. As recently as yesterday, a delegation from the Irish Meat Association visited the Department. The slaughtering of animals clearly cannot continue because factories cannot continue to process and store meat for markets which do not exist at present.</P>
      <P>The problem must be addressed European-wide. There is no alternative but to put in place an intervention mechanism because people in our major markets have stopped eating beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Our controls are among the strictest in the world, which is a source of reassurance to consumers at home and abroad. The primary concern is that people would have confidence in the safety of our food. Until yesterday, there was a price decrease of approximately 10p per pound in cattle sold over the past two weeks. Has the Minister estimated what impact the suspension of trade with Egypt will have on the price of beef, assuming trade will continue in the marts? What will the impact be on a mart which has an annual turnover of £200 million? The impact will obviously be very serious for our 100,000 beef producers, particularly winter fatteners who will become virtually impoverished if this ban continues. Some of those people stand to lose up to £8,000. What special measures, aside from intervention, can be taken to address this matter? <Col N="331" /> Other countries have obtained EU assistance to help to sustain farm families whose livelihoods are threatened.</P>
      <P>Why was a co-ordinated EU strategy not put in place to ensure that a united approach was adopted to control BSE, particularly in view of what happened in Britain? We led the way in regard to BSE controls. The testing of all animals over 30 months and the temporary ban on meat and bonemeal will be discussed at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers. The Taoiseach indicated this morning that the Minister will support those measures. Why did he not support them last night in the national interest during the debate on the Labour Party motion? Given the comments made by Commissioner Byrne at a news conference yesterday, we should impose a complete ban on meat and bonemeal.</P>
      <P>What is being done in regard to carrying out further research on BSE and vCJD? What funding is being provided by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Health and Children? Is the Minister satisfied that an adequate number of staff is devoted to the research task which is an essential one if we are to continue to reassure consumers? </P>
      <P>The Minister listened last night to Members' views on the problem of disposal. Are there other recommendations of the advisory committee set up by the previous Government which the Minister took on board and which could be implemented? If so, when are we likely to see them implemented?</P>

      <P>The loss of the Egyptian market would be enormous and constitute a real setback and body blow to the industry. We are talking about 157,000 tonnes or 450,000 cattle. The market was growing over the past couple of years following the setback in 1996. For the first half of this year we exported 93,000 tonnes, which would amount to up to 500,000 head of cattle in a full year. Losing that market would be devastating. Ireland was by far the most effective exporter to Egypt, supplying two-thirds of their trade. That is why we looked after the market and sought to support it in every way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked what package might be put in place. We will be seeking the introduction of supports as farmers have lost heavily. I have already given figures of 10p per pound, with the cow beef market having been virtually wiped out. The French introduced a package, a copy of which I gave to Deputy Dukes, but there is not much in it. It talks about giving some support to workers in factories, etc. We are studying that package as well as having consultations with the farming organisations, who are again coming to the Department this evening. We want to be properly focused going to Monday's meeting and to have the best line of negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a comprehensive list of controls which I circulated to all Members this morning. I have no difficulty with additional controls. The hall<Col N="332" /> mark of the authorities in Ireland has been to introduce and implement controls in line with developing knowledge, and any recommendations made by the Food Safety Authority, which has been in existence since 1998, and the scientific steering committee, have been put in place. If the Commission recommends a total ban on meat and bone meal then we will implement it. However, there is a difficulty in terms of disposal. Up to now we did not feed meat and bone meal to ruminants. There was a voluntary ban in the poultry industry and only a negligible number of pig producers had a licence to feed meat and bone meal. Therefore, 99% of the meal was exported, which could be described as an Irish solution to an Irish problem. We had a successful export market for the meal, but with a total ban in Europe there will be no further export market and the question of disposing of 150,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal arises.</P>
    <P>We have gone to the cement industry and pigmeat plants to ask if they will use the meal in their incinerators, but we have had no support. This matter cannot be dodged any longer and I was pleased that there was general consensus in the House that we must address it. I was pleased to hear Deputy Sargent talking about veterinary disposal. I asked him what he meant afterwards and he said he was referring to disposal of livestock or bovine material and that the Green Party would have no difficulty with such disposal. I do not know why it should cause problems for the Green Party, but I was pleased to hear Deputy Sargent's comments.</P>
    <P>The real problem with meat and bone meal is avoiding cross contamination. We have satisfied all the authorities that we had avoided that in Ireland. The EU Commission communiqué from Commissioner David Byrne said &ldquo;I have repeatedly said that the existing Community controls, if strictly implemented, ensure that meat and bone meal are safe. Furthermore, the scientific steering committee yesterday once more confirmed this view&rdquo;. There is no difficulty, therefore, with the feeding of meat and bone meal to non-ruminants. It is a bit like our depopulation or slaughter out policy &ndash; if it contributes to increased consumer confidence we have no difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>Research is very important and my view is that we do not have enough research into this matter. The first outbreak in Ireland was one animal in 1989 and the learning curve has continued for the past decade. We are introducing additional controls. Consumers are correctly saying we are introducing a further control and are now saying beef is again safe. Typically, Ministers for Agriculture are seen eating burgers and steaks saying they assure consumers the product is safe. Now we are saying we have additional controls and that the product is extra safe, which tends to reduce the credibility of everybody. Therefore, research is vital. We carry out some research in Ireland, mainly in UCD, but it is not enough. We are involved in joint research with the UK and pool resources in terms of EU research. <Col N="333" /> However, far more research must be done. For example, it was only in October 1996 that my predecessor, Deputy Yates, earmarked very substantial amounts of money for modernising our rendering industry and the equipment used. He ensured the machinery in the industry could treat meat and bone meal at 130º Celsius at three bars for 20 minutes, which is the key. Up to then research was sparse and it was only at that stage such a recommendation was made. It was a very good decision.</P>
    <P>We have been pioneering those controls but are still lumped in with the other western European countries as if we had done nothing.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister and the efforts he is making to deal with the current European crisis in the beef industry. The Minister will be aware of the serious impact this will have, especially for beef producers. I am particularly concerned about small beef and cattle producers who in less serious situations are very adversely affected by such incidents. Will the Minister keep in mind that the loss of the Egyptian market in particular would have a very serious detrimental effect on the store cattle business? Will he given some assurance that every effort will be made to minimise the effect of that on small cattle producers?</P>
      <P>There is a necessity to allay the fears of consumers in general about BSE and I support the view already expressed that it is necessary to carry out additional research in this area. How much meat and bone meal is being imported? How much is in storage and how much is used? Is it advisable at this stage to ban the use of meat and bone meal until such time as its safety can be ascertained and assured?</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions I sought to have some type of hardship fund put in place for farmers affected by BSE, in addition to the normal supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, 140,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal were produced in Ireland, 2,000 tonnes of which were used in Ireland. That gives an indication that banning it would not be the end of the world.</P>
      <P>The problem is disposal. We do not have a difficulty with disposal based on any scientific recommendations from any scientific body. In 1990 the importation of meat and bonemeal in feed to ruminants was banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumers need every possible assurance as to the safety of the meat they eat. In the case of prime steer beef, from steers of two to two-and-a-half years old, on the Egyptian market, which is the key market with which we are concerned outside of Ireland, there has not ever been a case of BSE. There is an urgency about seeking to encourage farmers to produce cattle up to 30 months of age for the market and for consumers. Retaining large cattle for 40, 42 or 45 months will not be the way of the future. There is no doubt we will have to process cattle and make them <Col N="334" /> available to consumers at a younger age. Prime steaks and prime beef is the meat we eat in Ireland also. There has not ever been a case of BSE in those cattle.</P>
    <P>Professor Michael Gibney of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland from Trinity College, also chairman of the BSE food safety group and a member of the EU scientific steering group reiterated this morning that our controls were entirely satisfactory; so also did Dr. Pat Wall, chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Nonetheless, members of the media, as late as today, said there were 20 cases of BSE this month, the highest on record. That was a nice multi-coloured graph to add a little more emotion and scare people. I am sure 20 members of the human species died of various ailments during the month also, some related to various activities and yet did not merit the same headline. There is an enormous difficulty here for the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the trade itself, for farmers in getting the positive image across. As late as today radio and television referred to this matter as &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;&ndash; to heighten emotions. It is a BSE matter, and &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo; is terminology we could do without.</P>
    <P>To answer the Deputy's question, everything is being done that can be done to restore confidence. At Monday's meeting of the Council of Ministers I will seek appropriate measures and appropriate market interventions that will have an impact on farmers, especially smaller farmers because they have little else. Not only had the finishers a bad year this year but they have had several bad years. To be honest I do not know how they stay in the business. They bought expensive store cattle and are in a dire situation. I will seek measures that will be helpful to them.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept this is the most serious situation Irish livestock farmers and the industry have been in for many years? Is this the same Minister who sat on this side four years ago and had all the answers? The Minister said the factories are taking in cattle. However, I would point out that the numbers being taken in are very small and the price received is extremely low. If this continues how many of these farmers will go bankrupt? The Minister said he would speak to some people by 'phone and to others on the margins of meetings etc. A major effort should be made by the Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach. I recall the advice the Minister gave when BSE first came to notice. He had all the answers. How much beef is being sold into Iran or, if not in operation, how soon will that market be reopened? Can he guarantee that the weight restrictions imposed by one of his predecessors in Brussels will be increased, otherwise intervention will be meaningless? Will the Exchequer pay a sum of money towards a rescue plan for farmers? What will it cost the nation if the workers in the factories lose their jobs and have to go on social welfare? Is it <Col N="335" /> not time we bit the bullet and made sure there was some provision for dealing with waste material? I have been trying to deal with this issue for years and I am pleased to hear the Green Party is supporting us. There have been all sorts of scurrilous efforts to stop this being dealt with here. What is it costing to get rid of specific materials? What is it likely to cost when all the other waste is added? A national decision was taken to deal with this in a positive way so that we can use it for the provision of power as well as getting rid of the problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now in a position to commence an assessment of the losses being suffered within the beef industry. We all agree the beef industry has been the poor relation of Irish farming in the past five or six years and will move from being under pressure to being extinct. When does the Minister plan to put a rescue package in place? He has given an indication that he will meet farming organisations as early as this afternoon. From the Oireachtas, he must be in a position to send a strong signal to the farming community, whose livelihoods are disappearing, that he will provide financial compensation. There is a consumer side to the equation which is of huge importance. There is also the commercial side from the farmers' perspective. Will the Minister announce at an early date that he will put money on the table to compensate those farmers in the short-term?</P>

Will he agree that there is nothing like that certainty on the other side of the coin? Will he agree that so far we have heard only vague statements about intervention, including a proposal from the Commission about increasing the advances on premia &ndash; which farmers are due to be paid in any event. The only measure being proposed by the Commission that seems to meet any part of the problem is the purchase for destruction of animals of over 30 months, which might help the price of cows. Will the Minister agree that what is needed from the European Union and the national authorities are specific, positive, quantified measures to deal with the dramatic income losses facing farming families? </P>

      <P>Deputy Penrose asked about fallen animals. The £11 million will go towards transport costs and vehicles. It would not be a pleasant experience to travel with open vehicles carrying fallen animals. The rendering cost must also be considered. There will be a cost of £20 to farmers, which has been agreed with the farming organisations. A sum of £28.5 million was mentioned of which £14.5 will be paid by the Exchequer. No other country has introduced such an agri package in good faith. I am aware it will not address the problem, but it was a gesture of good faith.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to emphasise the urgency of the current ASTI dispute. I again plead with the Government to take part in worthwhile negotiations to end this dispute which is a disaster from the point of view of the students involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting took place last Monday night in St. Joseph's secondary school, Newtownforbes. This was attended by hundreds of people who are <Col N="338" /> extremely concerned about the future of the school. The Mercy Order, who are the trustees of the school, announced the previous week that the school will be closed by 2003. The news was received with extreme shock and sadness in the area. There are approximately 175 students attending St. Joseph's secondary school which has a long and proud record. At one stage it was one of Ireland's best known schools in relation to exam results and other activities such as music and so on.</P>
    <P>Given that the boarding element of the school ended ten years ago, naturally numbers have fallen. However, Newtownforbes is situated not far from Longford town and the area qualifies for rural renewal status. The number of houses anticipated for the area and the number of planning applications indicate that this area will need all its current educational facilities. Will the Minister of State ensure that this school is maintained to serve the needs of the people in the surrounding area? Educational facilities must be maintained so that students and parents have options. Most Ministers, Governments and school authorities are striving for smaller numbers in order to give students the time and individual attention this type of facility can provide.</P>
    <P>I will be very interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on this issue which is ongoing. The parents are meeting this evening with the Mercy Order and I will continue to work on their behalf, and on behalf of the whole area, to ensure that the school is retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Belton for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>In relation to the ASTI dispute, we all share his concerns in this regard and recognise that the teaching profession must be valued and properly remunerated. I hope the ASTI will accept the invitation to become part of the benchmarking process and work within the PPF to ensure they can get the recognition, status and pay they deserve.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific issue raised by Deputy Belton, St. Joseph's secondary school was established in the early 1950s. Formerly an all-girls boarding school, co-education was introduced in the late 1970s and in 1989 the boarding element of the school was closed. Enrolments at the school peaked in the early 1990s at more than 450 pupils. However, in the intervening period, there has been a steady decline in numbers and the current enrolment stands at 175 pupils. Based on the pattern of decline to date, future intakes of fewer than 30 pupils could have been anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent past, the trustees of St. Joseph's, the Sisters of Mercy, western province, met officials of the Department of Education and Science to discuss the matter. The Sisters confirmed that, in view of the major decline in enrolments in recent years, it was their intention to announce the closure of the school. They have decided that closure is to be on a phased basis over the next <Col N="339" /> two years, with final closure at the end of the 2002-03 school year. There will be no intake of first year pupils next September but all existing pupils will be in a position to complete their junior or senior cycle, as appropriate, at the school.</P>
    <P>The Sisters of Mercy also indicated to officials in the Department of Education and Science that it was their intention to discuss their decision fully with the school board of management, the staff and parents. Meetings have taken place with the board and staff and a meeting with parents is imminent. This is an important process, given the order's history in the area. Departmental officials will continue to monitor developments closely to ensure that alternative places will be available for pupils completing junior cycle in St. Joseph's and for those who would otherwise have enrolled in the school.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Mercy order on its record of educational achievement at St. Joseph's over many years. Fortunately, they will maintain an educational presence at second level in the area through Meán Scoil Mhuire in Longford town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, but I would have liked the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to be present.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the serious and dangerous overcrowding and chaotic scheduling on the DART network, which traverses my constituency. Day after day I receive complaints from constituents who state that they are being treated worse than animals on seriously overcrowded DART trains during the rush hour. This morning a young man almost fainted in the crush on the 8.50 a.m. DART from Kilbarrack station and had to be held up and assisted by his fellow travellers. People of all ages have suffered serious distress in recent months due to intolerable overcrowding on rush hour DART trains and workers with disabilities have been prevented from travelling.</P>
      <P>Many women commuters have informed me that, because their experiences on the DART were so claustrophobic and frightening, they will never use the service again. Through the extraordinary incompetence of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the new Dublin transport strategy is being ripped apart before it even begins because the workers to whom I refer feel they have no choice but to return their cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that 100,000 commuters use the DART service on a daily basis and that 170 trains travel on the network each day. However, the key reason for the ongoing chaos on the DART network is the Government's deplorable lack of investment in the service. In 1984 the DART service was launched with 80 carriages and until last month not a single new carriage was purchased by Iarnród Éireann because the Government starved it of capital investment. Last month, ten new carriages were purchased from the Alston <Col N="340" /> company in Barcelona and 16 more are due from the Tokyo Car Corporation in Japan. Unfortunately, these 16 carriages will not enter service until April 2001 and a further 12 carriages from the Tokyo Car Corporation will not arrive until late 2001 or early 2002.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and Dr. Lynch of CIE to contact countries with transport systems similar to our own &ndash; I refer here to Russia which uses the same train gauge as Ireland &ndash; and immediately purchase 35 to 40 carriages before somebody is killed.</P>
    <P>The arrival of the new carriages to which I referred has coincided with the Government's decision to bring forward the introduction of the Malahide-Greystones DART service. The Government PR hype surrounding the launch of the new service completely ignored the resulting removal of 18 DART trains a day from the Kilbarrack to Howth line and the dangerous and chaotic overcrowding in rush hour on the existing network. In effect, Deputy O'Rourke has put her PR campaign about the extension of the DART network before the health and safety of existing commuters.</P>
    <P>I recall attending several meetings during the term of office of the rainbow Government in the company of the current Taoiseach and Tánaiste. We seemed to have similar views on the urgent necessity for a well resourced, well run city metro for Dublin. However, two and a half years were wasted before either of them ordered the purchase of a single new item of equipment or asked for drivers to be trained. This is characteristic of the lethargic approach of the Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Government.</P>
    <P>On a recent Saturday night, eight carriages were lost to the hard-pressed extended DART network through vandalism at Harmonstown and Dalkey stations, where two trains were vandalised and set on fire by thugs. This, again, highlights the fact that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has refused to assist Iarnród Éireann to establish a transport police service. Every metro system in Europe is guarded by some form of transport police service or is served by a late night ticketing service of some kind, but Ireland seems to be the only place where this matter is not taken seriously. Indeed, many Ministers in the Government do not take the needs of Dublin seriously.</P>
    <P>The possibility that an accident involving the overcrowded trains which use the routes at rush hour on a daily basis might occur does not bear thinking about, particularly in light of the recent spate of deaths and injuries in the UK. In addition, the treatment of commuters with disabilities is utterly disgraceful. There are no staff available to assist with the portable ramps that have been provided in many stations.</P>
    <P>The overcrowding on northside DART trains is intolerable. I call on the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and Dr. John Lynch, the new executive chairman of CIE to take immediate and <Col N="341" /> urgent action. I urge the Minister to purchase today, if necessary&mdash;</P>

Perhaps Deputy O'Rourke and I should travel, post-haste, to Moscow to purchase this equipment.</P>

      <P>I apologise on behalf of Deputy O'Rourke who cannot be present. As a person whose constituency is served by ten DART stations, I accept there continues to be a degree of overcrowding on DART and other suburban trains at peak periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed us that DART carriages are designed to operate in an urban environment and can cater for a large number of standing passengers. At present, the DART is being operated within its design capability and the company assures us that this practice is safe. The Government has been aware of the overcrowding that has been experienced by users of the suburban rail network which includes the DART. Since its commissioning in 1984, the DART fleet has comprised 80 carriages up until recently. Ten new carriages have been delivered in recent months and eight are now being brought into service. These have already made a substantial difference on the DART line. These new carriages enable Iarnród Éireann to provide increased capacity on DART services, particularly on the Greystones to Malahide line, and will help alleviate overcrowding. Two further carriages will also be available for use at peak times from the end of the year. A further 16 carriages have also been delivered recently and will enter <Col N="342" /> service in the spring of next year, following commissioning. In addition, 12 more carriages have been ordered and are due for delivery late next year and early in 2002.</P>
    <P>I reject totally what Deputy Broughan stated about the lack of investment. The figures which show the anticipated increases in carrying capacity of the DART speak for themselves. From 1984 to September 2000, there were 80 carriages in the fleet carrying 14,000 people; as of December this year there will be 90 carriages capable of carrying 15,750 people; from spring next year there will be 106 carriages capable of carrying 18,550 passengers; and from summer 2003 there will be 118 carriages with a capacity to carry 20,650 passengers.</P>
    <P>Capacity on the suburban rail network, apart from the DART, did not increase substantially until this year when 20 diesel railcars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann. These carriages are undergoing commissioning at present and will increase capacity by 2,500 places when put into service. I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that 16 of the 20 new railcars will enter into revenue service on the Connolly to Maynooth line on 2 January 2001, with the remaining four going into service in February 2001. The introduction of these carriages coincides with the introduction of the double line from Maynooth into the city.</P>
    <P>During the coming months, commuters on DART and suburban rail services will see an improved level of services in terms of increased capacity and a more frequent service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Health and Children to answer this matter.</P>
      <P>There is serious concern in County Kerry about the rumoured downgrading of the breast cancer clinic at Tralee General Hospital. This concern results from a report by Professor Niall O'Higgins which recommends the creation of a number of specialised breast cancer treatment centres throughout the country. It is feared that Cork University Hospital will become the treatment centre for Kerry patients. The development of breast cancer centres is highly desirable but not to the detriment of services at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Since the breast cancer clinic was established in Tralee in the early 90s it has provided excellent treatment for 50 patients, on average, every year. The numbers, unfortunately, are growing. These people have, in general, done better than patients at other centres. The back-up services including mammogram X-rays, breast care nursing and physiotherapy are of the highest standard. In addition there is an oncology ward where patients may complete their chemotherapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 500 women are screened ever year for breast cancer in Tralee General Hospital and up to 50 patients undergo treatment, with very positive results. The inconvenience which would be involved for many patients travelling long distances from places such as Ballydavid, Valentia or Tarbert to attend clinics in Cork or Dublin is <Col N="343" /> so prohibitive that some women may delay seeking advice and diagnosis and leave it too late for effective treatment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children should develop a nationwide protocol for the treatment of breast cancer combined with video conferencing and computer link-ups, which would enable each centre to provide the optimum treatment for each patient. I understand the specialist group which was set up to develop breast cancer services met with the Southern Health Board but did not meet any of the women who were successfully treated in Tralee General Hospital. This is a source of regret to many of the women who could have outlined the case for Tralee General Hospital. Any of these women could have made a constructive contribution to the expert group.</P>
    <P>The prospect of travelling to Cork for treatment is a source of considerable distress for many women. When your life is under threat from this dreadful disease you need not only the best medical care available but also the support of family and friends, and not the extra trauma of isolation far from home. Kerry women want the option of staying close to their families and friends and they have absolute confidence in the treatment facilities and the medical personnel at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I quote an extract from correspondence sent to the Minister and which I received recently. This letter from a woman who experienced breast cancer reinforces my argument that the services in Tralee should not only be retained but expanded. She writes:</P>
    <P>In my place of work, from a workforce of 100, I and two of my colleagues have suffered from breast cancer over an 11 month period. So, unfortunately, I have intimate experience of the physical and psychological trauma endured by sufferers. The breast clinic at Tralee General Hospital has been constantly there for me and I credit it and the wonderful people who work there as my saviours.</P>
    <P>I speak for all Kerry people when I call on the Minister to provide extra funding to enable the services to be expanded at the breast cancer clinic at Tralee General Hospital and not to downgrade it. I make this appeal on behalf of the victims of this deadly disease which, unfortunately, appears to be on the increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I am glad of the opportunity it affords me to inform the House of the current position in relation to breast cancer services at Tralee General Hospital. The overall objective of the cancer strategy and of the breast cancer sub-group is to improve outcomes for women all over the country and in Kerry. The provision of medical services in Tralee General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request the national cancer forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group was asked to assess the <Col N="344" /> impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer screening programme, the increase in the target population, the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening. The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to me on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services and the resources required to develop these services and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
    <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought regarding how the service should be developed in their regions. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their regions were sought.</P>
    <P>The sub-group found that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survivial to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>I have received a report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. No final decisions regarding implementation arrangements at health board level have been taken. I established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has advised me that the general hospitals committee meeting of the board scheduled for 7 December 2000 will hear a presentation on the report of the sub-group of the cancer forum. The presentation will be given by Professor Paul Redmond of Cork University Hospital who is the new chairman of the national cancer forum and is the regional director of cancer services in the Southern Health Board region. I understand Professor Redmond will outline the important role Tralee General Hospital has played and will continue to play in the future as it is intended that Tralee General Hospital will be integrated into the overall breast cancer services.</P>
    <P>The committee members will have an opportunity to consider in detail the proposals for this new service in the Southern Health Board region. There are no proposals either to cease or reduce in any way the existing services provided at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I understand the Southern Health Board proposals to develop a quality and integrated service for the women of Cork and Kerry are being <Col N="345" /> drafted and, following consideration by board members, will be forwarded to my Department.</P>
    <P>I will keep a close eye on this matter and will work with the board to make sure we have a consensus resolution of these issues. The board's objective is to enhance services for women in the Southern Health Board area. I ask people to concentrate on this aspect of the proposals. Nothing will be taken from an existing service in any general hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is not in the House to hear this debate. I am glad, however, that a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children is here because this is a health and safety issue.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter as a Deputy from a coastal location in a year when at least 27 people have died in marine accidents. I extend my sympathy to the many families, including county people of my own, who have endured loss and express my relief that 13 Spanish people were rescued at sea today.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt but that fishermen have a tough life living among the elements. That is reflected in the fact that it is becoming more difficult to attract new people into the industry. At a time when the potential mix of fishermen is widening and we do not necessarily have people from a fishing background, it is essential to call on the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to look again at all aspects of marine health and safety.</P>
      <P>We have the report of the marine safety group since 1996. It is time all the recommendations in that report were fully implemented. That is not to avoid giving credit for what has been achieved in the very significant support for the renewal of the fleet that was forthcoming under this administration and totally ignored by the previous one. We have excellent fishery training schools and I extol the great work being carried out in Greencastle. There are tremendous advances in the development of the entire marine emergency services, formerly Cliff Sea Rescue. We have well-trained and vigilant personnel manning our radio stations, for example, at Malin Head. There is huge investment in the upgrading of boats and the purchase of new ones. Yet, we have the death toll we saw this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having spoken at length to people in the industry I reiterate that the recommendations in the safety review report must be fully implemented. We need, at the least, safety courses for all those going to sea &ndash; basic requirements that would give them the best chance should they run into difficulty while at sea. Recommendations 18 to 34 cannot be long-fingered any more. Similarly the issue of regular publicity drives to educate, advise and help develop a stronger safety culture among those working in the industry are vital. While accepting the development of devices such as EPIRBS, I draw attention to the possibility that <Col N="346" /> there are other devices that could complement the work of EPIRBS. I have discussed many times with the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Woods, the locator buoy devised by John Kelly in Moville, County Donegal. It is a very simple device for locating boats lost at sea. I have heard support voiced for this invention from Greencastle to Castletownbere and yet I await news that the Department has tried out this device.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister bring my requests to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and ask him to take a serious look at devices such as those of Mr. Kelly. This device, in the view of practising fishermen, has much to commend it. At a time when we should do all we can to save lives and learn from the inadequacies of past examples, surely money should be set aside for trials of existing prototypes and the development of others. Surely the Minister should direct the coastguard and or BIM to test out an invention that, at the very least, would provide an opportunity for people to find their lost loved ones and have a grave to go to. That might sound callous but the number of people who do not have a grave to visit is horrendous. I know many of them.</P>
    <P>Let us set the standards for marine safety for the rest of Europe. Perhaps we should look to re-man the lighthouses which would not only reinstate an extra presence around our coasts for fishermen but would serve other important policing functions. We are an island nation. We should have the potential to earn a good living from the sea and be safe while engaging in that. It is time marine matters got the place it deserves but has lost over the years.</P>
    <P>I know everyone concurs with these sentiments and I look forward to the Minister's reply and the full and immediate implementation of the safety review's 63 recommendations. I look forward to the considered response to the safety device that has, according to fishing experts, the potential to complement the EPIRBS and speed up the process of locating of boats in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>Coming up to Christmas, I wish to extend my sympathy to all those who have lost loved ones at sea, to commend those who risk their lives in sea rescue and trust that for all who rely on the sea for their livelihood this Government will continue to do what it can to make it as safe a place of employment as possible and enable those spouses and families who remain onshore to have greater peace of mind. I rely on the Minister of State to bring my concerns to the attention of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <P>Like Deputy Keaveney, on behalf of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I extend my sympathy and that of the Government to all those who were bereaved as a result of the recent maritime accidents. Deputy Keaveney has a keen knowledge of the fishing industry and she, like all of us, is conscious of the need for an effective regime for the fishing industry. Such a regime needs to incorporate not <Col N="347" /> only formal training but general safety awareness and education.</P>
      <P>Safety training is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has been working closely with BIM to ensure that new and more accessible training facilities are provided for fishermen. In 1996 when the fishing vessel safety review group reported, there was only one training facility for the fishing sector, the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle in County Donegal. Since then a second regional training centre opened in Castletownbere in 1999 and two mobile coastal training units have also been established. These units provide basic sea-survival and first aid courses in the fishing ports around the country. In addition, the mobile units have three small mobile trailers which can be towed to any part of the country and used for training purposes. Deputy Keaveney will be aware that the Government has given approval for the development of a £30 million state of the art maritime college which will provide training for the marine industry generally and the Naval Service. The college will train students to the relevant international standards which are set by the STCW 95 convention.</P>
      <P>BIM has produced an integrated training plan for the Irish seafood industry 2000-2006 which will, <i>inter</i><i>alia</i>, deliver a wide range of training course to the catching sector with significant emphasis placed on safety training. It is worth noting that BIM's training budget for the fishing and aquaculture sector amounts to £10 million for that period.</P>
      <P>With regard to mandatory safety training for the fishing industry, there are a number of considerations to be taken into account. While this was a recommendation of the fishing vessel review group at the time, representatives of the fishing industry expressed strong reservations about this proposal. They argued that there was a serious shortage of well-trained deckhands and that fishing vessels rely heavily on casual labour, without whom some vessels could not put to sea. The situation in relation to the shortage of manpower for the industry has deteriorated since the FVSRG report in 1996 to such an extent that BIM is actively trying to recruit non-EU nationals for the fishing sector. The policy adopted by both BIM and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to date has been to provide high quality, easily accessible training facilities and to encourage the industry to avail of these opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major review of manpower requirements in the fishing industry is currently being finalised and will address safety requirements, among other matters. The Minister looks forward to seeing that review and will consider the question of mandatory safety training in that context. I will ask the Minister to consider safety and location <Col N="348" /> devices such as those mentioned by Deputy Keaveney.</P>
    <P>I stress, however, that safety training is an integral part of the syllabus for fishing skipper and deckhand courses run by BIM. The previous Minister, Deputy Woods, introduced a range of measures two years ago providing that radios and EPIRBS would be carried by all fishing vessels and I am glad to say that the required EPIRBS worked successfully in recent cases. Regulations were also introduced to give effect to the Torremolinos Convention on fishing vessels over 24 metres as recommended in the 1996 FVSRG report and work is well advanced on draft regulations for the smaller sizes of fishing boats which have been the subject of consultation with the industry.</P>
    <P>As part of an overall safety enhancement regime for the fishing industry, a programme for the renewal of the whitefish scheme was announced in June 1998. The aim of the scheme is to promote investment in new, more modern and safer vessels and in modernisation and safety improvements. Under the scheme, 29 new vessels have been approved for funding and many more have availed of 50% grants for the purchase and fitting of safety equipment.</P>
    <P>The network of marine data buoys now being established around the coast will make a major contribution to safety at sea for fishermen. These buoys will considerably improve the accuracy of weather forecasts being made available to the fishing industry. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has allocated £0.5 million for the current year for this project and has allocated funding for the next two years to ensure that the project can be completed.</P>
    <P>As part of the programme to enhance safety awareness among the fishing industry the Department regularly issues marine notices. The latest marine notice relevant to the fishing industry, No. 14 of 2000, recommended that a personal flotation device of at least 100 newtons buoyancy be worn at all times when on the deck of any fishing vessel or boat, irrespective of size, and that is be donned as a routine measure prior to putting to sea.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority also undertakes a programme of raising safety awareness among fishermen which includes visits to fishing vessels, the production of a video on lifejackets and survival suits and a leaflet on safety in fishing. In addition, the marine safety working group established under the auspices of the Department, which includes representatives of the Coast Guard, the RNLI, Water Safety Ireland and the Irish Sailing Association, undertakes the publication of a wide range of literature including some specifically dealing with the subject of safety on fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is doing all it can to ensure the safety of our fishermen as they go about their daily work in an often dangerous and hostile environment.</P>

      <P>The scheme referred to by the Deputy is the facility whereby a person who intends to purchase a motor vehicle may choose and reserve a particular registration number in advance of registration.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who operate the reservation scheme, that the conditions and procedures are as follows: an application may be made only on or after 1 November of the year before it is intended to bring a vehicle into use; the fee for a reserved number is £250; the number chosen must be one in the normal format, and must correspond with the place where the applicant normally resides and the year in which the vehicle is to be first brought into use. All registration numbers are available for reservation, with the exception of the first number of each year issued in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford which is traditionally reserved to the Mayor-Lord Mayor of each of those cities; the registered owner of the vehicle must be the person in whose name the number was reserved. Reserved numbers are not transferable; reserved number may not be displayed on a vehicle until such time as it has been formally assigned by Revenue at the time of registration after it has been reached in the normal sequence. The processing of applications commences on the fourth working day of November each year. Applications are dealt with on a first-come first-served basis. Where a number of applications are received for the same number, at the same time, the successful applicant is decided by lottery. Where a reservation is cancelled, the number becomes available for reservation again, with priority being given to previously unsuccessful applicants, if any.</P>
      <P>To date 490 numbers have been reserved for the year 2001. This amounts to £122,500 in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the reason why the Revenue Commissioners do not permit the transfer or exchange of reserved numbers is to ensure that each prospective motor vehicle owner has full and open access to the reservation system on a first-come first served basis, on payment of the prescribed fee. If transfers or exchanges were permitted, this would lead to the development of a commercial trade in reserved numbers and the <Col N="350" /> block booking by individuals of desirable numbers which would be sold off to the highest bidder. This would militate against the ordinary motor vehicle owner being able to reserve the number of his or her choice on payment of the £250 fee. Transfers or exchanges would also have considerable implications for Revenue in the administration of the reservation scheme. These would include the need to ratify each transaction and adjudicate on disputes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced on 20 July 2000 that from 2002 the income tax year will be aligned with the calendar year. From that point, Budget day tax changes and social welfare weekly rate improvements will be brought forward to 1 January. This will be of importance to taxpayers and social welfare recipients who will benefit earlier from budget day changes compared with the current position where tax changes apply from April and social welfare changes from May. It had been announced already that, in 2001, social welfare increases would apply from April.</P>
      <P>Using the calendar year will put the collection of income tax on a more rational and simplified basis. Combining this change with the introduction of the euro in cash form will allow necessary changes to information technology systems to be made in one go. From 1 January 2002, the tax year will run from 1 January to 31 December.</P>
      <P>There will be a transitional tax period of nine months running from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001. In general, annual tax allowances and credits will be scaled down to 74% of the amount appropriate for a full year. In this way, taxpayers will find that their weekly allowances and credits in the transitional period will work out the same as in a full year.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the changeover to the calendar year there will be a change in dates for filing of tax returns and payment of tax for self-employed taxpayers. These taxpayers will pay preliminary tax for the current year on 31 October. They will also file returns for the previous tax year and pay the balance of tax due in respect of the previous tax year on the same date. The dates will apply in 2002 for returns and payments in respect of both the 2001 transitional period and the 2002 tax year.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the change, it may be necessary to have an earlier budget day rather than early December as at present.</P>

In addition my Department is a licensed user of the Economic and Social Research Institute's SWITCH model, which shows the combined impact on the tax and social welfare changes per income decile, and has had access to the output of the model. The SWITCH model, which is a technical aid that can be used to assist with poverty proofing exercises, uses a nationally representative sample of households to analyse the distribution of budgetary changes in tax and social welfare.

      <P>The Deputy is probably referring to the OECD's Economic Outlook which was issued last week. Regarding prospects for the Irish economy, the report states that strong, broad-based economic expansion is likely to continue this year, with real GDP growing by around 11%. According to the report, the rate of economic growth should slow steadily thereafter, to 7.9% in 2001 and 7% in 2002 as labour shortages become more pronounced. This accords with the views outlined in the Economic Review and Outlook which my Department published in August.</P>
      <P>This means, of course, that the OECD is forecasting that Ireland's economic growth in 2001 and 2002 will be more than double the pace across the euro area where growth of about 3% is expected over the next two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has been active in seeking reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, in a variety of areas, over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw Deputies' attention to the issue of country representation at the Institutions. A review of the quota allocation is about to commence in the IMF and I expect will be followed by one in the World Bank. I am in favour of a greater say for the emerging and poorer countries. There are a number of ways in which this might be achieved &ndash; through quota adjustment, board representation or enhanced involvement in decision making generally. In addition a vital aspect of the whole reform programme, and one which we fully support, is more consultation with the developing countries both at governmental and civil society level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> On the issue of debt relief, the House will be aware that I am a strong advocate of greater speed and flexibility in implementing the enhanced HIPC initiative. With our co-constituents of Canada and the Caribbean countries we have been pressing for reforms in order to bring faster and more effective progress on poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>In this context I stressed in my contribution to the recent annual meetings in Prague that the parameters of the HIPC initiative should be kept under review, with a view to appropriate remedial action where necessary.</P>
    <P>On the issue of transparency Ireland has always been a supporter of greater transparency in the operations of the institutions. I am glad to say that this view is now prevailing and I welcome the extent to which progress has been made and will continue support further reforms in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I support greater co-operation between the World Bank and the IMF. Both institutions are aware of the necessity for better co-operation and the need to rationalise their own operations and this is being addressed. In addition I support greater co-operation across the range of multilateral institutions and this, too, is now being addressed.</P>

      <P>The Department advertised for suitable applicants to submit names for consideration for inclusion in a short list, phase 1, leading up to a separate competitive process to award a licence to operate the national lottery. Three applications were received from the current operator, Autotote Worldwide Services and Rockdean Limited a subsidiary of Sisal, a Milan based lottery operator. All three were deemed eligible to progress to phase 2, the actual selection process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation group chaired by my Department at second secretary level and comprising four other senior officials was established for phase 2 Mr. Sean Cromien, former Secretary General of my Department, was appointed as process auditor to assure that the process is implemented in an open and transparent manner. The evaluation group recruited a firm of consultants to advise and assist with the design of the invitation to apply, evaluation of proposals received and the final selection of the successful applicant. The three applicants were issued with a draft invitation to apply and a draft licence on 26 September last. They were subsequently invited to an applicants conference on 27 October which afforded them the opportunity to query the documents and to raise various issues concerning the future operation of the lottery. As can be <Col N="355" /> appreciated, the process, which is ongoing, is a complex, time consuming and deliberative one, involving extensive advices on the legal aspects of the process. For these reasons, and before issuing a final invitation to apply and licence, it is essential that appropriate time and resources are dedicated to ensuring that my Department conducts a fair and objective competitive process. Arising from a request from two of three applicants for a two month extension of the current application date of 4 December 2000, I have informed the applicants that I am minded to grant this extension. This will entail a further extension of the licence from April 2001 to the end of 2001.</P>

      <P>The national pensions reserve fund Bill was passed by the Seanad yesterday and has gone to the President for signing.</P>
      <P>The Government has already allocated over £4.8 billion to the national pensions reserve fund. These moneys are currently being managed by the NTMA in short-term deposits held in the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities. Allowing for interest, it is projected that the value for the temporary holding fund will be over £5 billion by the end of this year. It would be desirable to commence, as soon as possible, the process of transferring these deposits to longer term investments, consistent with the objectives of the national pensions reserve fund. This obviously cannot be done until the Bill is enacted and the fund established.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides that the establishment day will decided by the Minister and appointed by ministerial order. It is my intention to set the establishment day as soon as possible after the Bill's enactment. I recognise, however, that some breathing space will be necessary to enable the manager &ndash; the NTMA &ndash; to finalise the preparations for the setting up of the fund and I will have to take that into account in setting the establishment date.</P>

      <P>The ongoing strategic management initiative, or SMI, is the principal means by which improvements in the efficiency of the public service are being pursued. Under the SMI, programmes of change have been initiated which are directed at delivering quality customer services, simplifying regulations and improving openness and trans<Col N="357" /> parency. These are underpinned by initiatives to improve management of the public service through better human resources policies, more comprehensive financial management and better use of information and communication technology to support delivery of services.</P>
      <P>For example, Delivering Better Government sets out the programme of change in the civil service. The programme of change is now underpinned by the national agreements &ndash; Partnership 2000, provided for participative structures to involve management, unions and staff in each organisation in the development and implementation of action plans to progress the modernisation programme, and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which provides,<i> inter alia</i>, for implementation of performance management systems. The SMI process is underpinned by key legislation such as the Public Service Management Act, 1997, and the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>While considerable progress has been achieved in implementing programmes of change, much remains to be done including the implementation of performance management and development systems across the public service, introduction of new financial management systems, implementation of electronic government and improved service delivery.

    <P>(iii) Outstanding vacancies in Government Department and Offices</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance database on Civil Service numbers provides a snapshot in time of officers serving in Government Departments and offices. It does not, however, maintain a record of vacancies in all Government Departments and Offices. The following figures have been compiled from the various personnel areas throughout the Civil Service. This shows the total number of vacancies at 2,531. Last month, a series of questions to Government Departments elicited a response suggesting some 1,800 vacancies in the Civil Service, this did not take into account <Col N="362" /> Offices such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of Public Works, Central Statistics Office etc. A substantial number of these posts have been sanctioned very recently in connection with sudden increases in workloads, for example, refugees, and for new tasks that have been taken on or are projected in Departments and Offices.</P>
    <P>Again, a comprehensive list of vacancies is included for the Deputy's information. The main Departments-Offices concerned are: Justice Equality and Law Reform 755; Revenue Commissioners 446; Agriculture, Food and Rural Development 407; Education &amp; Science 116; Vacancies in Government Departments and Offices.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the growing tightening of the labour market which reflects sustained, strong economic and employment growth and the major reduction in unemployment achieved in recent years, notwithstanding rising labour force participation.</P>
      <P>A range of measures put in place by the Government has facilitated that increase in participation, including early intervention with the unemployed and measures to help the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups under the national employment action plan; ongoing implementation of the national development plan which contains some £10 billion for policies in the areas of employment and human resources; initiatives taken in response to recommendations by the expert group on future skills needs; the revamping of the work permits system and introduction of a new working visa system to attract migrants; and, reductions in the burden of taxation.</P>
      <P>In so far as proposals to encourage additional participation in the labour force are concerned, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not customary for the Minister for Finance to indicate in advance what measures, if any, will be taken in the budget which could have a bearing on this issue.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the conclusions and recommendations contained in the First OECD Environmental Performance Review of Ireland, which was received recently. Like all reports received from the OECD, its contents are being examined by the relevant divisions within my Department.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a previous occasion, taxation can play a part in attaining environmental goals. As Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that tax measures take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>

    <P>At the time of the December 1999 budget, the Department of Finance forecast that inflation would average 3% for 2000 as a whole. This was based on a technical assumption of unchanged interest rates, exchange rates and commodities prices. As Deputies are aware, oil prices have increased over the course of this year, the ECB has increased interest rates from 2.5% on budget day to the current rate of 4.75% and the euro declined. These unforeseen developments explain much of the increase in inflation this year.</P>
    <P>While I do not propose to begin making forecasts of monthly inflation, I will say that in common with most forecasters, I expect the measured inflation rate to fall from December and into next year as the impact of a number of external factors which pushed up inflation this year begin to ease. <Col N="366" /> My Department's latest assessment of the outlook for inflation will be published on budget day.</P>
    <P>Last June the Government announced a number of measures to combat inflation. These included reform of the licensed trade, the imposition of temporary price controls on alcohol, no new increases in charges and levies by public bodies. Additional staff and resources were also announced for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to initiate a vigorous programme of price monitoring and publicity. The Government is closely monitoring the impact of these measures and recent indications are that they are working. The question of further measures is being considered in the context of the budget.</P>

    <P>I have met with Mr. Mark Durkan, MLA, Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Northern Ireland Executive Committee on two occasions as part of the North South Ministerial Council &ndash; NSMC &ndash; round of sectoral meetings dealing with the special EU programmes body. Our first meeting was held in Dublin on 16 July 2000 and the second meeting was held on 15 November 2000 in Omagh. Mr. Durkan was accompanied by Mr. Sam Foster, MLA, Minister of Environment at the Dublin meeting and by <Col N="367" /> Mr. Dermot Nesbitt, MLA, Minister at the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, at the Omagh meeting.</P>
    <P>Both meetings concerned the arrangements for the establishment and workings of the special EU programmes body, one of the six implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, and the range of EU programmes that body will be responsible for managing over the coming years. The body has been designated the managing authority for the new Peace and Ireland/Northern Ireland Interreg III programmes and has a particular role in promoting and monitoring the implementation of cross-border co-operative activities in the context of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and the Northern Ireland Structural Funds Plan 2000-2006. The body has also been involved in the preparation of other Community Initiatives which have recently been submitted to the European Commission. I have agreed with Mr. Durkan that the next meeting of the NSMC relating to the special EU programmes body be scheduled for next February.</P>
    <P>Shortly after his appointment as Minister of Finance and Personnel, I met Mr. Durkan at the plenary session of the NSMC on 13 December 1999. Mr. Durkan made a courtesy call on me at my offices on 2 February 2000 and I met him again when I addressed the chamber of commerce in Derry on 27 October 2000.</P>

      <P>As I indicated last week, it is my intention to provide for tax relief in respect of the historic cost of taxi plates bought by existing taxi licence holders. The price actually paid for a plate will be treated as capital expenditure for tax purposes similar to plant and machinery bought by a business. Accordingly, a capital allowance will be applicable so that the actual cost of a taxi plate can be written down over a period of years, similar to plant and machinery. At present, a capital allowance is claimable over seven years at a rate of 15% of the cost of the asset for each of the first six years with the final 10% in year seven.</P>
      <P>For example, in a case where a taxi plate was bought for £50,000, the owner-driver may offset £7,500 for each of the first six years, against taxable trading income earned in this period and £5,000 in the final year, year seven. In the event the owner-driver has less than £7,500 or £5,000 in taxable income per annum &ndash; on even no taxable income &ndash; he or she will be able to carry forward the unused amount to a later year or years for off-setting purposes.</P>
      <P>The capital allowance will be fully offsettable against taxable earnings at the marginal rate of tax payable by the taxi drivers concerned. The allowance will be based on the historic or actual cost of the taxi plate. Finally, only the trading income derived from a taxi by the owner himself/herself may be taken into account in using the capital allowance. In other words, the allowance will not be offsettable against other income.</P>
      <P>This information was communicated to the representative taxi organisations at a meeting on Tuesday last between them and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government Deputy Molloy, who is responsible for taxi regulation.</P>

      <P>I have not yet concluded my consideration of the report as I am awaiting the outcome of the examination <Col N="369" /> of the report by the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-Committee on Certain Revenue Matters at a hearing which is taking place today. I will give detailed consideration to any recommendations made by the sub-committee before I submit proposals to Government in a Memorandum which, as I have already indicated in my response to Deputy McDowell on 26 October last, I anticipate will not be until early in the New Year. As I also indicated to the House on that date, I do not intend to delay consideration of the recommendations and I will make speedy decisions on them.</P>
      <P>However, the report contains 48 recommendations in all, some of which involve administrative actions not requiring Government decisions, that is, those relating to the reorganisation structures below board level within Revenue. The report recommended that Revenue undertake a number of these actions by the end of the year. Some of these relate to Revenue's proposed major restructuring programme which will involve extensive changes in the way Revenue is organised and which was endorsed by the steering group report.</P>
      <P>Revenue have indicated that they have commenced work in planning and developing the processes and structures that will have to be put in place to implement the overall change agenda. This will involved setting up a project board and a number of project teams, each of which is to be headed by an Assistant Secretary. The teams will develop proposals to implement the recommendations relating to: the proposed large cases division; the single prosecutions division; the pilot integrated regional structure in the south-east; realigned Revenue legislation services, and new head office structure.</P>
      <P>The report further recommended that Revenue's plan to establish a manpower advisory service be proceeded with and that an organisational development Unit also be established as a matter of urgency. Revenue intend to establish both units shortly.</P>
      <P>To facilitate these proposals, my Department recently sanctioned an extra 31 posts to carry out this work, including an additional Assistant Secretary post to progress the establishment of the large cases division.</P>

      <P>In framing last year's budget the Government set out to achieve a number of objectives. These included sustaining social partnership, tackling social priorities and addressing infrastructural problems, while pursuing sensible budgetary policies. <Col N="370" /> A balance was struck between these competing objectives. I am happy that the correct balance was attained and that we met our key objectives while minimising the impact on domestic demand and price pressures. In particular, the budget helped to support social partnership, which is the best way to maintain price and wage stability and to sustain growth.</P>
      <P>Given the open nature of the Irish economy, and the difficulties in quantifying the actual inflation impact of different budgetary measures, it is not possible to precisely determine the impact of the last budget on inflation. However, it is possible to measure the impact of the decision to increase excise duties on tobacco for health promotion reasons. It is estimated that this added 0.8% to the Consumer Price Index.</P>
      <P>In response to the rise in inflation this year, the Government implemented a number of measures in June. The latest indications suggest that these measures are having a positive impact.</P>

      <P>The commissioners are currently in the process of filling these vacancies through the normal methods, i.e. internal Revenue competitions and promotions, from the current transfer system and from interdepartmental and open competitions.</P>
      <P>Specifically, in relation to the two grades mentioned by the Deputy, there are 20 vacancies at higher tax officer level and 40 vacancies at tax officer level as at 27 November 2000.</P>
      <P>With regard to the filling of the higher tax officer vacancies there are 16 higher tax officers who are to take up duty shortly from open competitions held by the Civil Service Commission and 94 tax officers have been requested from the commission to deal with current and other anticipated vacancies. An internal Revenue competition for appointment as tax officer is due to be held very shortly. It is expected that the staff circular will issue before Christmas with the selection process being concluded by the end of January 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government supplies agency manages the purchase of personal protective equipment on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the contract for the supply of 425 leather motorcycle suits was put out to competitive tender. it was advertised in the European Journal, national newspapers and invitations to tender were also issued to firms on t he Government supplies agency's bid list of approved suppliers.</P>
      <P>The motorcycle leatherwear comprises one jacket with two detachable liners and one trouser with one detachable liner. The specification requires that the suit offer the wearer protection from impact, abrasion and water ingress. Uniformity in design and makeup are also required. The garment is made to measure.</P>
      <P>Six firms responded to the competition, Carra Ireland Limited, Kestrel Fashions Limited, Branded Leather County Kawasaki Distributors, A.T. Uniforms Limited. and Hideout Leathers Limited.</P>
      <P>The contract was awarded to the following suppliers: AT Uniforms Limited, 31 Waterloo Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 and Carra Ireland Limited, Carra House, Baldoyle Industrial Estate, Dublin 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AT Uniforms Limited was awarded the con<Col N="372" /> tract for 325 suits at £625 per suit, on the grounds that the offer conformed to the requirements of the competition and was deemed the most economically advantageous offer received. The following decision criteria were taken into account: price, quality, after sales service, delivery and track record in the supply of certified personal protective equipment. The quality, after sales service and delivery requirements of the competition were set by the Garda.</P>
    <P>The contract was not awarded to the firm detailed in associated question 25838/00. AT Uniforms is a separate company, which does not operate in the retail market, specialising instead in the contract sector.</P>
    <P>Carra Ireland Limited was awarded a trial contract for 100 suits at £525 per suit to test an alternative product, which marginally failed to meet the required specification but was the lowest offer received. This action give a new competitively priced supplier the opportunity to acquire a proven track record, thus increasing future competition in an area of limited supply. It also tested an alternative commercial standard, with a view to revising the specification for future requirements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the tax payer received the best value for money.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the level of supervision and monitoring of accounts in Irish banks having regard to recent reports that a number of foreign leaders had used Irish banks to hide money stolen from their own people; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to a number of foreign leaders having used Irish banks to deposit funds. I am aware of recent reports regarding one former leader having used a bank located in Ireland to deposit funds. I understand that these reports are being investigated to establish whether Irish supervisory requirements relating to money laundering have been breached. No approach has been made by the authorities of that country to the Irish authorities to date.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, created the offence of money laundering and obliged financial institutions, <i>inter alia</i>, to identify their customers and to report suspicious transactions to the Garda Síochána. The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, also obliges the Central Bank to report to the Garda Síochána where it suspects that an offence under the money laundering provisions of the Act has been or is being committed by a bank it supervises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank, as part of its supervision of Irish banks assesses the adequacy of procedures adopted by banks to counter money laundering and the degree of compliance with such pro<Col N="373" /> cedures. Irish banks are required by the Central Bank to establish adequate procedures of internal control and communication to prevent money laundering, including the designation of a money laundering reporting officer whose responsibilities include the prompt reporting of suspicious transactions to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As with all prudential matters, should issues arise in a particular institution, which come to the Central Bank's attention, it would take immediate action, including, in the case of Irish banks, specific inspection work where necessary to confirm that the management of the institution had taken any necessary remedial action and, in the case of branches of EEA credit institutions operating in Ireland, liaison with the banking supervisory authority in the home member state responsible for the supervision of that institution.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that appropriate measures are in place to minimise the risk of Irish financial institutions being used for the purpose of money laundering.</P>

      <P>The Irish economy should continue to grow strongly over the next five years, albeit at a slower pace than in the recent past. With unemployment below 4%, a lack of available labour, in conjunction with infrastructural constraints which cannot be resolved overnight, will slow economic growth over time.</P>
      <P>The timing and extent of this slowdown is, of course, difficult to forecast. Developments in the international economy and, in particular, the performance of the euro in the period ahead will be crucial factors. Price and wage developments are also important. To ensure a so-called soft-landing for the economy we must continue with the policy mix that has been so successful in the past. The maintenance of social partnership, prudent budgetary policies and sensible pay evolution are essential if we are to achieve a gradual slowdown.</P>
      <P>In the absence of external shocks &ndash; over which governments have no control &ndash; I am confident that, with the correct policies, we can sustain growth and achieve this so-called soft-landing for the economy.</P>

    <P>*Provisional &ndash; subject to revision.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The amounts paid by each sector must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in the PAYE and self-employed, including farming, sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes on table</i>(a), (b) PAYE figures: </P>
    <P>(i) Income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries. It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income. It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(ii) The average tax payment for each year in column (a) is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1995 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1995-96. This number <i>excludes </i>income earners on the PAYE tax record who are exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>The average tax payment for each year in column (b) is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the total number of income earners on the PAYE tax record <i>including </i>those who are exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>(c) Farming figures:</P>
    <P>(i) In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units assessed to tax for the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1995 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1995-96. These numbers <i>exclude </i>cases who are not required to file annual tax returns and whose position is reviewed periodically because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>(ii) The figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession. Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</P>
    <P>(iii) Income tax on farming profits is collected <Col N="375" /> with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be precisely distinguished. Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>(d) Other Self-employed figures:</P>
    <P>(i) The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (c).</P>
    <P>These numbers <i>exclude</i> cases who are not required to file annual tax returns and whose position is reviewed periodically because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Notes</i>(i) A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii) Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously. This due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii) Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and dividend withholding tax are not included in the calculations. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that e-shopping can refer to physical delivery of goods ordered over the Internet and the on line supply of digital services. The current position in relation to VAT is set out below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Goods ordered over the internet, but physically supplied from Ireland to a non-taxable person in Ireland are subject to Irish VAT. Where goods are physically supplied from another EU Member State, it is the rate of VAT in that Member State which applies. This generally applies unless the supply is subject to distance selling rules and the threshold is exceeded, is excisable goods or is a new means of transport and in such cases Irish VAT applies. Where the goods are physically supplied from a third country, Irish VAT applies unless the consignment is of a value not exceeding £36 which is sent as a gift from private individuals for the exclusive personal-family use of the recipient. Such consignments are admitted free of customs duty and VAT. In addition, packages with a value not exceeding £18 regardless of <Col N="376" /> their commercial status can be admitted free of customs duty and VAT.</P>
    <P>The on-line supply of digital products is treated as the supply of a service rather than goods for VAT purposes and the standard rate is generally applied. Where digital services are supplied from Ireland to a non-taxable person in Ireland, Irish VAT applies. Where they are supplied from another EU member state, the rate of VAT in that member state applies. Where they are supplied from a third country, no VAT applies at present.</P>
    <P>As regards the rate of VAT on e-shopping, I should explain that the VAT rates vary according to the product or service. Thus, food products or books ordered on-line are zero rated for VAT purposes, while digital services are generally subject to the standard rate. This is consistent with an approach which applies the same rate to the same product irrespective of the way in which they are distributed. Where goods or services are standard rated, it is generally only possible to reduce the rate as part of any reduction in the overall standard rate. Where goods are sourced from outside the EU, customs obligations may also arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that a draft EU directive on determining the new rules applicable to digital supplies was discussed at Ecofin on 27 November and all member states are anxious to resolve the issue VAT on digitally supplied services at an early date.</P>

      <P>The National Climate Change Strategy provides a framework for achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions in the most efficient and equitable manner while continuing to support economic growth and to prepare Ireland for the more ambitious commitments that will be required after 2012. The analysis and assessment of taxation measures will be overseen by the tax strategy group, which is chaired by an official from my Department. The National Climate Change Strategy anticipates that necessary supporting analysis will be commissioned prior to the preparation of proposals for the tax strategy group. I have already indicated to the House in earlier answers the difficulties arising from the unilateral imposition of tax based on carbon emission.</P>
      <P>Taxation can however play a part in attaining environmental goals. Of course, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that tax measures take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>

      <P>The policy development of widening the standard rate tax band has been debated at length in this house and elsewhere since Budget 2000. The Deputy will be aware that part of the context for the policy changes with respect to band widening that I introduced in Budget 2000 was the Government's target that at least 80% of taxpayers should not be subject to the higher rate of tax. In my statement on Budget 2000 I pointed out that one of the chief problems with the taxation system was the low level of income at which single people became liable to the top rate of tax and that single people who were on incomes less than the average industrial wage were paying tax at the top rate. The aim of the initiative on completion was to reduce the percentage of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax to 17% or 12% if exempt cases are included. The Deputy will also be aware that the policy of establishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers was supported by the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The social partners also support the target that at least 80% of taxpayers should not be subject to the higher rate of tax.</P>
      <P>I understand that the NESF report, which is referred to in the question, deals with the alleviation of labour market shortages &ndash; it does not concern taxation matters as such. However, the report, in its references to taxation, indicates &ldquo;support in principle for moving to more individual taxation&rdquo;. It also acknowledges that widening of the tax bands is in itself progressive. To complement band widening, as part of an overall tax reform package, the report suggests that measures be adopted for those on lower incomes and/or all taxpayers equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The data, as quoted in the Deputy's question, <Col N="379" /> on the distributional impact of the band widening does not coincide with what I understand is contained in the NESF report on the alleviation of labour markets shortages. It is also noteworthy that the data in the NESF report was produced using the ESRI's SWITCH system. The output of that system depends on the parameters and assumptions that are input to the system. I am not aware of the parameters or assumptions used by NESF to generate the output. I am sure the Deputy will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to outline at this stage the measures that are to be included in my Budget statement on 6 December next.</P>

      <P>The annual financial allocation to the Office of Public Works for flood relief is provided to meet the office's expenditure requirements on an ongoing programme of flood relief works. On the basis of the flood relief work programme of the Office of Public Works for the various schemes at design stage, funding has been provided to cater for those schemes which are anticipated to go to construction stage during 2001.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the engineering design, the environmental factors and the potential impact of any proposed civil engineering works, it is necessary to consult with relevant local interest and local authorities. Consequently, any new areas brought to my attention as a result of the recent flood event, would not be expected to reach construction stage within a year. Additional funding is therefore not necessary in 2001. However, the Deputy will be aware that the Government are providing separate funding for a humanitarian assistance scheme to relieve hardship caused by the recent flooding and that the Irish Red Cross Society are implementing this scheme on the Government's behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Company profits are taxable at a number of rates <Col N="380" /> which depend on the nature of a company's activities. Income from manufacturing and certain other activities, such as IFSC and Shannon trading activities, is taxable at 10%, income of small and medium enterprises where total trading income does not exceed £50,000 is taxable at 12.5%, income from dealing in residential development land is taxable at 20%, other trading income is taxable at 24% and other income at 25%.</P>
      <P>Corporation tax is not charged on accounting profits but on the taxable profits of companies. These are generally calculated by reference to the financial statements of the company. The trading profits computed under accounting principles are then adjusted to take account of specific provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. These adjustments include the disallowance of charges for commercial depreciation, entertainment expenses and certain motor expenses and the allowance of capital allowances, losses of the company and its fellow group companies and other reliefs and exemptions.</P>
      <P>Revenue does not have readily accessible data on accounting profits. The data captured from companies' tax returns relates to taxable income. Data available for accounting periods of companies ending between April 1998 and March 1999 indicate total taxable income and gains after all deductions of £16.6 billion. For this period tax payable from all companies liable to tax, including those with income chargeable at the 10% rate or the standard rate of tax amounted to £2.5 billion, giving an average tax rate of 15%. The Deputy may also wish to note that the standard rate of corporation tax was 32% for the calendar year 1998 and 28% for the calendar year 1999, that is the relevant standard rates that applied during the accounting periods ending between April 1998 to March 1999. In addition, during this period a reduced rate of corporation tax of 25% applied on the first £50,000 of a company's income earned during the calendar year 1998 and on the first £100,000 of income earned during the calendar year 1999.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I should point out that it is an established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about the tax affairs of an individual or a company, other than when the Deputy asking the question was asking the question on behalf of the taxpayer. In this instance it would appear that the Deputy is not asking the question with the consent of the company concerned. In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that I must follow the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that the information sought should not be divulged on grounds of confidentiality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration, by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The most recent road accident report published by the National Roads Authority for 1998 showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34. EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group <Col N="384" /> set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report, it is hoped to bring proposals to Government with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of ensuring that the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It would appear that the implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition from authorised insurers in all EU member states, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Although I am conscious that the relative high cost of motor insurance can present hardship to many young drivers, I am not aware of any employment opportunities being denied to young males as a direct consequence of the relative high cost of motor insurance.</P>

      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for the employer of the person concerned to determine whether a statutory redundancy payment is due. The criteria for this are laid down in the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, and cover such areas as the requirements to have at least two years minimum service, the employee having been between the ages of 16 and 66 at the date of termination of employment due to a genuine redundancy situation and the employee having been insurably employed, etc. In the event of these criteria being fully met, it is up to the employer to make the correct statutory payment and then to apply to my Department for a 60% rebate.</P>
      <P>Where a position in a company has been made redundant, with another person not simply replacing that person and doing identical work, then the fact that an employee has been away from work due to an occupational injury should not preclude him or her from applying for a statutory redundancy payment, provided all statutory criteria are met.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications and broadband infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. One project supported under this initiative is the provision of an improved broadband infrastructure in the Mayo region, which is being completed by Eircom. Part of this project entails the provision of a fibre-optic cable between Westport and Castlebar. Most of the civil works on this project are completed and overall project completion will be achieved early in the new year. On foot of this project, Westport will be directly connected for the first time to the fibre-optic backbone network and businesses in Westport will have a better quality service, increased bandwidth and more access options.</P>

    <P>There were two cases of BSE in County Mayo over the past four years, one in 1998 and one in 2000. I have already indicated that, I do not con<Col N="388" /> sider it appropriate to publish the precise locations of burials in each county, which would entail the publication of the name and address of every farmer in whose herd a BSE suspect animal was found. I am, however, prepared to make available on a confidential basis, and at the request of each county manager, the locations of burials in the relevant county, for the purpose of facilitating local authorities in allaying local concerns which in this context might be addressed to them. Arrangements are already in train to release information to those county managers who have so far requested it.</P>

      <P>At a meeting held on 21 November, the Government approved my proposals for draft legislation on dormant accounts and the legislation will now be finalised by the parliamentary counsel. Officials will also consult with the credit union movement in relation to arrangements that could apply to dormant accounts in credit unions, on an agreed basis. I expect that legislation, which will apply to all financial institutions, will be published early in 2001.</P>
      <P>The legislation will define &ldquo;dormant accounts&rdquo; as being any account with no customer-initiated transactions in the previous 15 years. The underlying objective of the proposals is to ensure that the funds in these accounts are returned to their rightful owners. Credit institutions and insurance companies will be required to take all reasonable steps to identify the beneficial owners of such funds, with a view to repayment. It is only where the owners cannot be traced that the funds will be taken into the care of the State with a right being guaranteed to the beneficial owners or their successors of those funds to seek a refund at any point in the future.</P>
      <P>The legislation will not affect the right to privacy which currently exists between a financial institution and its customers. This will be fully protected under the proposals, as no information regarding the original ownership of dormant accounts will be made publicly available, or passed to the State.</P>
      <P>A board of trustees, nominated by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will be set up with a remit to disburse any surplus funds &ndash; those over and above what will be required to meet possible refunds to owners &ndash; for charitable purposes or purposes of societal and community benefit. It is proposed that an independent chairperson be appointed, along with representatives of community and other groups, as well as a senior official from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The funds will be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the trustees. It is also proposed that the State Property Act, 1954, be amended to allow funds currently held in the intestate estates fund to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund.</P>

    <P>Progress to date on implementation of the NDP is satisfactory and will gather pace as projects and schemes get fully under way and attention is focused more on implementation rather than preparations. I am confident that all moneys identified for expenditure during the course of the plan will be drawn down. This will be assured because general progress under the plan is being monitored by the NDP/CSF monitoring committee and, at operational programme level, by the individual OP monitoring committees. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships, supported by a high level cross-departmental team, have assumed overall responsibility for ensuring that the key infrastructural investments under the plan are delivered. If, at any stage, remedial action should prove necessary to secure timely implementation of the plan, the arrangements in place between the Cabinet Sub-Committee and the monitoring committees are sufficiently flexible to enable decisive corrective action to be taken.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure on infrastructure under the plan in 2000 is expected to be close to the plan target for the year and expenditure on national roads is ahead of target. As regards the other categories of infrastructure, and as outlined in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary Ques<Col N="394" /> tion No. 116 on 26 October last on the matter, the normal pattern is for most of the expenditure on them to occur in the latter part of the year.</P>

      <P>However, the Euro 11 Finance Ministers and the ECB have stated that they share the view that growth is now very robust in the euro area and is increasingly rooted in domestic demand.

In their view, a strong economy goes along with a strong currency.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Euro area Ministers, the Commissioner and the President of the ECB have discussed economic prospects of the euro area, in light of the higher oil prices and recent financial market developments. They share the view that growth remains very robust in the euro area. The fiscal consolidation and the reform effort, especially in the tax field, are well under way.</P>
      <P>Ministers stress their determination to speed up this process and to promote the necessary structural reforms in view to increase the growth potential of the euro area. The ECB is committed to ensure that current growth will remain non-inflationary. The Eurogroup and ECB reiterate their common concern that the current level of the euro does not reflect the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area. They agree to follow closely the situation. A strong euro is in the interest of the euro area&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the £25 million investment package which I recently announced and which is aimed at alleviating anticipated critical service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in acute hospitals, over the winter period. Funding for the contracting of at least 500 additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards has been included under the initiative. The ERHA and the health boards are in the process of contracting these beds at present. I am satisfied that this part of the initiative will have a significant impact on the problem of inappropriate use of acute hospital beds with the immediate provision of additional bed capacity in a more appropriate setting.</P>
      <P>Under the winter initiative I have provided funding of £760,000 to the Midland Health Board in 2000-2001 for the contracting of additional nursing home beds and a further £95,000 for the provision of aids and supports for older persons. I am satisfied that this funding will help to alleviate anticipated service pressures across the Midland Health Board including St. Mary's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance comes under the aegis of my Department and is administered by the health boards. It was introduced in 1979 by Circular 15/79 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970. The purpose of the allowance is to provide financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport in order to finance the occasional taxi journey.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years &ndash; however, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. The current maximum rate of mobility allowance is £45.60 per month.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that this allowance, among others, is being considered in the context of the following interdepartmental working groups: the review group which is examining the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and the working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which is examining the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment, chaired by my Department.</P>

      <P>This scheme was 28th on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Kerry County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced in July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 121 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over. The other free schemes, including the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free Television Licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement provided that prior to the death of the spouse or partner, the couple were permanently residing together and that the survivor continues to meet the normal <Col N="405" /> conditions for eligibility. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 75 private transport operators.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the policy institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services and noted that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    <P>The review examined a number of alternatives to the existing system including the use of vouchers. It considered that a voucher type system which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys would be complicated and less feasible than the current system. Voucher schemes by their nature can introduce stigma to a scheme.</P>
    <P>The use of vouchers is not in keeping with a fundamental aspect of the scheme as originally envisaged; that of using existing spare capacity on public transport as it covers the country. It would do little to facilitate the provision of public transport services where none exist nor would it facilitate the provision of accessible public transport.</P>
    <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy. Proposals to address the rural transport deficit are being considered further by the relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Since July 1996 the free schemes, that is, the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are available to all lower income pensioners, including retired civil servants, who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, currently £96 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £101 for a recipient aged 80 years <Col N="406" /> or over, plus £30.00, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children, living alone, as appropriate. The make-up of this income limit means that it increases automatically each year on foot of the budget increases in pension rates.</P>
    <P>In addition, from October this year, the free schemes have been extended to all people aged over 75 regardless of income and household composition. The review of the free schemes considered that this extension of the free schemes would be of significant benefit to non-social welfare pensioners, including civil and public service pensioners.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made in the estimates for changes in the qualifying conditions for the free schemes as such matters are dealt with in a budgetary context. The proposals in the review are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent payable to persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>The person concerned received a rent supplement up to the end of September. Their rent supplement was suspended from that date as their claim was under investigation. A letter was issued on 20 November 2000 to the person concerned stating that their rent supplement was being reviewed and requesting them to contact the community welfare officer &ndash; CWO. No response has been received by the CWO to date.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of one-parent family payment of £100.70 per week which is the maximum rate payable to a person with one dependent child. This total includes a fuel allowance payment of £8 per week. Their entitlement to one-parent family payment is currently under review as a social welfare inspector has reported that the person is cohabiting.</P>

      <P>Pensions and other long-term social welfare payments have traditionally been paid by payable order books which are encashable on a weekly basis at post offices. Payment can also be made, at the person's choice, by electronic fund transfer, EFT, direct to bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Payment of pensions by EFT is generally made every two weeks in arrears. Other benefits are generally paid by EFT weekly in arrears, other than child benefit which is paid monthly in advance. Most people who opt to be paid by EFT do so at new claim stage so there is no interruption of the flow of payments once the claim is allowed. Where an existing recipient opts to switch from pension book to EFT, the different payment cycle may result in an interruption in payment. However, each person, regardless of the payment method, receives the same quantum of payments over the lifetime of his/her claim; the difference is one of timing only.</P>
      <P>The question of aligning payment frequencies is under consideration but due to other pressing demands on available resources it may not be possible to accommodate this change for some time. However, people who opt to have their payments changed to EFT are made fully aware of the different payment cycles.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was interviewed in July 2000 in connection with her application for one-parent family payment and was requested to supply a P45 statement from her last employer, a statement of mortgage from her local authority and information relating to a bank loan, in order to determine her means situation. Reminders were issued to her in August and again in September. She was also requested to provide documentary evidence of <Col N="408" /> her efforts to obtain maintenance from her spouse, who is in employment. In this regard a maintenance summons can be issued by a District Court clerk at no cost to her.</P>
      <P>Two of the requested documents have now been received by the Department. However the deciding officer still requires details of the bank loan and of the efforts by the person concerned to obtain maintenance from her spouse.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned has not provided all the necessary documentation, the decision in September 2000 to disallow her claim for one-parent family payment still stands. Her claim will be reviewed as soon as she supplies the outstanding information required.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an unemployment payment a person must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of a deciding officer, that he-she is available for and making genuine efforts to return to work. The onus is clearly on the applicant to demonstrate this.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to the previous question in this case, any efforts the person has made to obtain any employment, whether in the immediate locality or otherwise, to avail of services such as FÁS or local employment service, or to access any training available, will be taken into account by the deciding officer when deciding the case.</P>
      <P>A deciding officer will also take into account the economic environment and employment opportunities available, not only the immediate area or town, but in the wider community. However, deciding officers are not required to refer claimants to specific employment opportunities, nor could their decisions be conditional on them being in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, and be at least 21 years of age, 18 years of age for people with </P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April. This is increased to £8 per week for those living in areas designated as smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The conditions that apply to the national fuel scheme require that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and satisfy the living alone condition.</P>
      <P>The qualifying payments are mainly long-term payments such as long-term unemployment assistance, pensions and one parent family payment &ndash; OFP. Participants of employment programmes can also retain a fuel allowance as part of their secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>Recipients of family income supplement &ndash; FIS &ndash; who are living in areas designated as smokeless zones and who have a social welfare payment, for example, OFP will receive the £8 fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>Under the current arrangements, persons who avail of the back-to-work allowance and back to education scheme may retain their secondary benefits, at the level which obtained prior to participation in the scheme, subject to a weekly gross household income limit of £250. The retention of the medical card is not affected by the operation of the limit. These arrangements also apply to other labour market programmes, including the community employment scheme, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Budget 2000 provided for two important improvements in these arrangements. First, the back-to-work allowance payments and family income supplement payments are no longer taken into account for the purposes of the weekly £250 gross household income limit. Second, the maximum rent supplement payment of £250 per month has been abolished in favour of a tapered withdrawal of the supplement over a four-year period, with 75% of the claimant's previous entitlement being paid in the first year of participation in the scheme, and 50%, 25% and 25% being paid in the subsequent three years. These measures were introduced with effect from last April.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recently published abridged estimates for 2001. These estimates are based on the current position as outlined above.

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment <Col N="411" /> of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>SWA is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent and mortgage interest supplement recipients to retain their supplement as an in work benefit on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The operation of the scheme was examined in the context of the Government's commitment under Partnership 2000 to consider a tapering arrangement for SWA housing supplements, in consultation with the social partners and these improvements were introduced during 2000.</P>
    <P>The means test was also eased, with the introduction of a disregard for the back to work allowance &ndash; BTWA &ndash; and family income supplement &ndash; FIS &ndash; in the assessment of means for the £250 gross household income limit. PRSI and any reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, support is now provided over four years instead of three years and withdrawal of the supplement is now tapered at the rate of 75% in the year 1, 50% in the year 2, and 25% in years 3 and 4, instead of being withdrawn in one step at the end of the third year.</P>
    <P>Other improvements were also introduced during 2000. An employment programme for those who were unemployed for five years and over was introduced with effect from 21 August 2000. Participants on the scheme will receive an additional payment of £35 per week for up to six weeks compulsory training with an employer followed by an automatic transfer to the back to work scheme when the person takes up regular employment.</P>
    <P>There will also be two payments of £200 each after the person joins the BTWA programme. All of these payments will be disregarded in the assessment of the gross household £250 income limit for the purposes of rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>In addition, people who take up part time employment or participate in training courses will have £25 of their earnings disregarded in the assessment of means for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>As you are aware the Department of the Environment and Local Government are setting up a new rent assistance scheme to be operated by the local authorities. This will cater for those people who have long-term housing needs. Those with short-term housing needs will continue to be catered for under the SWA scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> As my Department's estimates for next year are prepared on the basis of no change being made in existing policy, no specific provision has been made for changes in the conditions outlined.</P>
    <P>The method of the means test calculation for rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context. As you will appreciate I cannot, at this point, give specific details of any proposed changes in this area in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that direct provision places asylum seekers in a disadvantaged or marginalised position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations under international law and the Constitution to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers. For the most part, it represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis. Reduced allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme are paid to take account of the full board accommodation provided. Asylum seekers can also apply for exceptional needs payments under the SWA scheme.</P>
    <P>Subject to satisfying a means test, asylum seekers are also entitled to medical cards. They are entitled to the same health services as Irish medical card holders and the children of asylum seekers can avail of free primary and secondary education.</P>
    <P>The introduction of direct provision on 10 April 2000 brought Ireland into line with other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, which introduced direct provision on 1 April last, and followed thorough investigation and careful planning. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum seekers is by far the best approach and I believe the system of direct provision represents a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence is that, like most public service employers, my Department has a strong record of facilitating the retention of existing employees who acquire a disability during their working life. These employees are as likely to be in upper or middle management positions as in any other grade. However, people with physical disabilities form a relatively small proportion of the working population generally and this fact is reflected in their relatively small representation in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to implementation of the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service. The commitment is part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and must be achieved during the term of the programme, no later than December 2002. A monitoring committee chaired by my Department meets regularly to advance issues and to encourage and guide the take-up of the 3% target for the employment of people with <Col N="417" /> disabilities. In the autumn, a series of initiatives were launched, on the advice of the committee and in partnership with the Equality Authority, as part of the drive to achieve the 3% target by 2002.</P>
    <P>Existing employees with disabilities count towards the 3% target. The remainder of the target numbers must come from the recruitment of employees with a disability into the employment, either through the general recruitment process or through specific positive action initiatives geared to attract people with disabilities into the public service.</P>
    <P>Steps have also been taken through recent legislation to ensure that disabled persons are not discriminated against in relation to employment opportunities generally. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, outlaws discrimination against people with disabilities and on eight other grounds, in relation to employment, training, work experience, conditions of employment and promotion. Indeed since the Act came into operation on 18 October 1999, employers must ensure that their practices and procedures prohibit less favourable treatment for persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In order to come within the scope of the Employment Equality Act, a person with a disability must be fully competent, capable and available to do the particular job and where necessary doing it with the assistance of special treatment or facilities. The Act places an obligation on employers to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability, unless the employer can show that there is a cost to him/her other than a nominal cost. The Act also allows positive action measures specifically geared towards the integration into employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority, which was set up under the Act, works towards the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities on the nine grounds covered by the Act. It also provides information and advice to the public in relation to the provisions of the Act. Anyone who considers that s/he has been discriminated against on grounds of disability, contrary to the provisions of the Act, may seek redress by referring the matter to the Office of Director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court in dismissal cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000/01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to depart from these indices as a guideline. With some 40% of third level students qualifying for maintenance grants, any proposal that student grants be brought in line with social welfare payments for the unemployed would give rise to considerable cost, estimated by my Department to be in excess of £50 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and, as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from <Col N="421" /> £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year expenditure on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million.</P>
    <P>In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced, on 11 November, that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>

Eligible part-time &ndash; EPT &ndash; teachers are engaged by vocational education committees in accordance with a scheme which has been agreed by the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Teachers' Union of Ireland, following a Labour Court recommend<Col N="423" /> ation. The scheme provides that EPTs may be re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. The information available to my Department would indicate that the teaching hours formerly provided by the teacher in question under an EPT contract are not available. Under the terms of the scheme, a panel for former EPTs is drawn up and every effort is made by vocational education committees to ensure continuity of employment.</P>
      <P>A review of selection and appointment procedures for VEC teachers has recently been carried out by the Irish Vocational Education Association, The Teachers' Union of Ireland and my Department and revised arrangements in regard to EPT contracts have been agreed by the relevant interests.

      <P>Under the terms of the 2000 third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, students pursuing 18 month courses leading to the qualifications of national certificates in manufacturing technology and in computing &ndash; IT &ndash; support, under the accelerated technician programmes, are eligible to apply for grants. Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology &ndash; GMIT &ndash; has confirmed to my Department that the student, to whom the Deputy refers, pursued an 11 week summer course in computing from 21 June until 5 September at the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the national certificate in computing &ndash; IT &ndash; support course is an approved course under the accelerated technician programmes, the summer course being provided in GMIT is not part of that programme and is not an approved course for grants purposes. Therefore, the student in question is not eligible for grant assistance, or to have her registration fee refunded, under the terms of the scheme, in respect of the 11 weeks summer course. However, the student in question was admitted to the 18 month national certificate in computing &ndash; IT &ndash; support course, under the accelerated technician programme, at Tipperary rural and business development institute &ndash; TRBDI &ndash; on 25 September 2000. As this course is approved for the purposes of the Third Level <Col N="424" /> Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees, 2000, the student is eligible to be considered for grant assistance in respect of that course.</P>
    <P>My Department understands from City of Galway VEC, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, that the student in question has been awarded a grant, for both maintenance and the charge for student services, registration and examinations, in respect of her attendance on the course at TRBDI. My Department is satisfied that the student in question has been assessed correctly under the terms of the relevant student support scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 to 155, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that plans are well advanced for an extension project, which will provide 1646mf7&gt;2 of additional accommodation at St. Declan's community college, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford, and for a major refurbishment of the existing accommodation at the school.</P>
      <P>The stage 1 site, suitability, report for this project was received in my Department in November 1995. This report contained two options. Further information on the relative costings of the proposals was requested. Following receipt and examination of this latter information, a planning and briefing meeting which involved all of the stakeholders in this project was arranged in September 1996 at which all options were discussed and the best option from an educational, architectural and value for money aspects was identified and agreed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a stage 2, outline sketch, report was received in my Department on 28 April 1997. In July 1997, approval to proceed to stage 3, developed sketch scheme, was conveyed to the school's management authority, subject to the inclusion of a number of amendments in the stage 3 submission. The stage 3 report was received in January 1998. Unfortunately, the report required a number of amendments. The revised report was approved in July 1998 and sanction to proceed to a combined stage 4-5, detailed design and bill of quantities, was conveyed at that time. Full planning approval for the project was granted on 29 March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1999 the stage 4 submission was received in the Department's post-primary building unit. However, the mechanical and electrical <Col N="426" /> element of this submission required substantial revision. A revised submission was duly received in March 2000 but this too required further revisions which were received in June 2000. Subsequently, correspondence was exchanged between the building unit of my Department and the school's management authority concerning a range of technical issues, which I am pleased to say, have now been largely resolved. The matter of allowing this project proceed to tender is currently being assessed and a decision will be conveyed to the school's management authority as soon as possible.</P>
