    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's millennium programme covers a two year period, 1999 and 2000. Since its establishment in November 1998, the National Millennium Committee has examined millennium proposals received and has made recommendations to the Government. The £33 million millennium fund is now fully committed, with approximately 2,400 projects and events at national, regional and local levels. Obviously, with such a large number of projects, the administrative work involved in the allocation of millennium funds is still ongoing.</P>
      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the millennium celebrations expenditure is, therefore, timely and very useful. The audit of expenditure took place at the beginning of this year, the midway stage of the millennium programme, at which point about one third of the overall fund had been disbursed.</P>
      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will come before the Committee of Public Accounts in due course. This is the appropriate forum for a detailed discussion on the matter, and I am sure the Deputy will agree that we can rely on the expertise of the Committee of Public Accounts to satisfy itself on the issues in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as the Dáil discussion. The Department's accounting officer will be available to the committee to answer all matters arising in the report. Without prejudice to the business of the Committee of Public Accounts and in order to be as helpful as possible to the Deputy, I make the following general comments.</P>
      <P>The concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report have been addressed by my Department and appropriate steps have been taken to take on board his recommendations in order to enhance the optimum level of control of Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, in respect of the principal concern on the question of vouching for grant payments, specifically raised by the Deputy, each of the four projects cited in the report have had their accounts inspected by an official of my Department. Their expenditure of millennium funding has been confirmed. Three of those projects, the Liffey boardwalk, the Liffey of lights and millennium festivals, involved public bodies &ndash; Dublin Corporation in respect of the Liffey projects and the Department of Tourism, Sport <Col N="4" /> and Recreation in respect of millennium festivals. The standard of operation of management procedures and expenditure controls in place in these organisations with regard to these projects were satisfactory in the view of the Department.</P>
    <P>With respect to the fourth project referred to in the auditor's report &ndash; the new year's eve concert &ndash; the accounts in respect of expenditure have been inspected by an official of my Department. This free all-day concert in Dublin was attended by up to 40,000 people and was broadcast nationally throughout the day. It was organised under very severe time constraints and involved close liaison between the millennium office, the concert promoters and the other agencies involved, including Dublin Corporation and the Garda. It is generally acknowledged that the circumstances within which this event was organised were exceptional.</P>
    <P>In addition to these four projects, a schedule of post-payment and pre-payment inspections of other millennium projects is being put in place. A number of such projects have already been visited by an official of my Department.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that there are many positive comments in the auditor's report, notably that the controls and procedures in relation to the selection of projects and adherence to funding limits set by the Government were generally satisfactory, particularly, as the report notes, when account is taken of the once-off nature of the grants and the volume of proposals processed.</P>
    <P>In case of any confusion arising from reports or inferences that millennium funds were not applied for the purposes for which they were approved, I take this opportunity to confirm the findings in the auditor's report that all millennium funding has been allocated on the basis of recommendations by the National Millennium Committee and with the subsequent approval of the Government. I emphasise that in no case has millennium funding been allocated in any way other than in this manner.</P>
    <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been of assistance in highlighting where procedures could be improved and these additional controls have been taken on board. I also emphasise that at no time has any Exchequer funding been placed at risk.</P>
    <P>To date, nearly £17 million of the millennium fund has been drawn down by recommended projects and I expect that by the end of this year the figure will be close to £20 million. The balance of the committed funding will be drawn down in 2001.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted by the millennium committee, with the approval of the Government, was to ensure the widest public participation in celebrating the event while, at the same time, ensuring that major national projects of lasting value were supported. This approach was the correct one and has been successfully achieved.</P>
    <P>The millennium celebrations were a unique and special challenge for all involved. I take this opportunity once again to thank the millennium <Col N="5" /> committee and all its members for their time and commitment. Their efforts, and the combined work of the very many people involved right across the country, ensured that Ireland marked the beginning of a new millennium in a meaningful, lasting and dignified manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the advent of the millennium hardly came as a surprise to this or any other Government and that, accordingly, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a damning indictment of the sloppiness and carelessness with which traditional procedures have been adhered to? Can he assure the House that moneys did not go astray, that where there are still gaps to be closed they will be properly closed and that a comprehensive report will be given, not to the Committee of Public Accounts, but by him to this House, to which he is accountable? This is not concerned with routine expenditure in the traditional way; funding was voted upon in this House and action taken on foot of that is directly answerable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in answering questions on this at any time. No moneys have gone astray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister of State know that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accounting Officer have clearly indicated such in the file before me. I read into the record of the House that no State funds were placed at risk at any time, that procedures were followed, the committee approved all expenditure and the Cabinet subsequently approved all expenditure.</P>
      <P>The criticisms of the Comptroller and Auditor General have been taken on board. The assessment was done at a time when there was enormous pressure on the Millennium Office, which had a very small staff. It was not a surprise, given the extra workload on the staff, many of whom had extra duties to attend. The pace of activity accelerated more quickly than we anticipated. I accept the criticism that we did not commence work quickly enough in the early part of last year. However, we increased our efforts very substantially and the events planned were very useful. The people enjoyed them.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Accounting Officer in my Department or any of the supervising officials engaged in sloppy procedures. At no stage does the Comptroller and Auditor General refer to these. He refers to one or two instances where they should have been more careful with documentation, but these were totally cleared up. Nothing else was involved there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officials involved followed the procedures as best they could. I have repeatedly said that last year was an unprecedented year &ndash; there are no files dealing with previous millennium cel<Col N="6" /> ebrations. Many of the procedures and events the committee became involved in were, by definition, once off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State designated with responsibility for millennium projects, does he agree in retrospect that by comparison with the celebrations in cities all over the world, those in Dublin were a damp squib if not a total fiasco? Does he also agree that it has added insult to injury to find that the taxpayers were ripped off, that money dedicated to some projects was not spent on them and that money was or may have been drawn down for purposes which were never intended? As Minister of State responsible, does he agree to attend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to explain what happened and why the Comptroller and Auditor General is of the belief that proper accounting practices were not followed and that taxpayers' money may have gone astray?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good opportunity for me to attend the joint committee and explain what a success the millennium year celebrations were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a yes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course. I would be delighted to attend the joint committee. I would point out to it that it is inaccurate to suggest, as the Deputy does, that funds allocated to projects were not spent on them. There is no example of that and the Comptroller and Auditor General makes no reference to it in the file. The procedures of the committee and the Cabinet were followed fully in respect of every penny of millennium funds. All funds have been spent on projects for which they were allocated. In case an impression is created to the contrary, the procedures of the committee and the Cabinet were followed for every penny of millennium funds. I would be delighted to go before the committee and point out that we spent £9 million on environmental projects and £7 million on social projects for the elderly, the disadvantaged, the homeless and for children. We have put £6 million into 2,000 locally funded community projects around the country and almost £4 million into supporting concerts, theatres, school projects, arts and education. We have given £2 million for Christian church functions, flood lighting for churches and so on, £2 million in recognition of the role of the Irish diaspora and more than £2 million for the celebrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a great deal of money has been spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to go before the committee and explain that those were investments in the future of Ireland at the turn of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Minister <Col N="7" /> of State to the second conclusion in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which states that the findings indicate that in a significant number of cases&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot quote during Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting; I am just assisting my memory. He stated that in a significant number of cases adequate evidence was not obtained that the expenditure on which grants were claimed had been incurred and that grant moneys were applied for the purposes for which they were approved. That report is in the public domain. If the Minister of State is referring to private conversations he has since had with the Comptroller and Auditor General, he cannot say what he said in his first reply to me that he is absolutely sure that money did not go astray. The Comptroller and Auditor General's second conclusion says it is wide open and we do not know. Until such time as he gets the receipts and vouchers, the Minister of State is not in a position to stand over the claim he made in his first reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a position to do that because those matters have been fully checked by officials in the millennium office and by the appropriate accounting officer since the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was finished. It has been ascertained that there is full documentation to support every payment. What the Comptroller and Auditor General meant was that when money was allocated to Dublin Corporation for the boardwalk, for example, the millennium office did not have the opportunity because of the pressure of work, speed and so on to ensure that Dublin Corporation had invoices for what it subsequently spent the money on. There was no doubt in the accounting officer's mind that everything was bona fide and that subsequently turned out to be the case after the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was finished. All those matters were checked since the report was finished and everything was found to be 100% in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it then that, contrary to expectations, all the moneys allocated by the Minister of State's Department for the boardwalk project, to which the Minister of State referred and which will not be completed by the end of this year, have already been vouched for or are in the process of being vouched for and that the normal administrative procedures are now in place? Is that what the Minister of State is saying in his report to the Committee of Public Accounts? Is it intended that a second Comptroller and Auditor General's report will be undertaken or is this his final word on the expenditures under the Minister of State's control? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if a second <Col N="8" /> Comptroller and Auditor General's report is anticipated. That is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General. He will be welcome to look at it. I confirm that all the procedures have been followed on the boardwalk project and all the documentation is in place. The accounting officer in the Department is fully satisfied that everything is in place. My information is that the boardwalk will be open before the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The next census of population will be held on 29 April 2001. The planned field-force to conduct the 2001 census of population will consist of five census liaison officers, 35 regional supervisors, 350 field supervisors and approximately 4,000 enumerators. CSO staff will provide the necessary administrative and statistical support for the census operation. To facilitate this task an additional 180 permanent civil servants will be employed for the duration of the census operation, after which they will be redeployed to other Departments with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In relation to the field-force, the top two layers have been put in place. Approximately 1,300 of the 2,700 applicants for the 350 field supervisor positions have been interviewed and the successful candidates from among them will be employed from January 2001. The 4,000 enumerator positions have been recently advertised. A three-prong strategy has been devised to mitigate the possible negative impact of labour market shortages on the recruitment of the numbers sought. A high profile publicity campaign is being run to emphasise to the public the importance of recruiting enumerators to carry out the census. The rate of pay for enumerators has been considerably enhanced compared with the rates prevailing in 1996. In the event that the required number of enumerators cannot be realised, it is proposed to employ a mail-back procedure for completed census forms on a targeted basis in some areas. This approach would most likely be used in urban centres. Delivery of the census forms to householders before census day would, however, continue to be done by enumerators. In all cases where a form is not returned by post, an enumerator will subsequently call to ensure all households are included in the census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the CSO has a strong preference for continuing the methodology used in previous censuses, whereby enumerators delivered and collected census forms, it is prepared, if necessary, to resort to the fall-back position of having some census forms returned by post. Such an approach was tested as part of the pilot census operation <Col N="10" /> carried out in September 1999 and it was shown to be a viable option.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the CSO is taking a pragmatic and flexible approach to ensuring the census will be a success. The Government considers it is vitally important that a full and accurate count of the population is achieved so that we can monitor the many changes occurring in society. I am sure the House will join me in urging full co-operation with the CSO next April when the field work begins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. Does the Government share my concern that it is absolutely essential that this very important exercise is undertaken to the maximum degree of efficiency and that the prospect at present of recruiting 4,000 enumerators is highly problematic? Will he indicate, therefore, to the House the steps he will take to ensure these enumerators are in place? There seems to be an admission that he will not be able to do the task in its entirety by reference to the use of mail, which is hardly satisfactory. Will he indicate the rate of pay to enumerators, for how long will they be employed and where and how will they be recruited?</P>

      <P>The CSO advertised recently for 4,000 enumerators. It is running a high profile publicity campaign and employing a mail-back procedure which it will use if necessary. I will return to the pay question later. There were 2,700 applicants for the 350 field supervisor positions, which is a satisfactory number. It appears, therefore, that some people are interested in helping to conduct the census.</P>
      <P>Remuneration will be on a fee basis. A terminal bonus of £300 will be payable on satisfactory completion of all phases of the work and separate fees will be payable for each phase. Fees payable for certain aspects of the work will vary between urban and rural areas. With regard to training, there will be a payment of £93. For each household enumerated, £2.15 will be paid and this will be divided as follows: listings per household 20p, distribution per household 20p, collection per household £1.75.

      <P>We must avoid difficulties that arose in relation to the administration of the millennium committee and I put it to the Minister of State that the census is of critical importance. He will no doubt agree that Government policy depends on accurate statistical information and there is no excuse for the Government not ensuring that the necessary temporary staff are recruited, trained and equipped. The value of the statistical database we will derive from the census will be well in excess of the current level of cost for its collection.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State return to the House before the recess to indicate the progress that has been made in this matter? Will he give a commitment to keep the House fully and accurately informed? In light of current economic circumstances, the Government has the money to fund this survey and we must ensure the necessary staff are recruited. Does the Minister of State agree that reliance on conventional methods would not be appropriate, particularly in light of the current state of the labour market, and that we will not be able to recruit the necessary staff unless we offer them extremely attractive terms?</P>

      <P>The consumer price index is designed to measure inflation. To do this it must reflect the change in the prices being charged for the full range of consumer goods and services available on the market. As considerable expenditure is incurred on tobacco products, they must be covered in the CPI for it to provide an accurate measure of inflation. This is consistent with standard international practice.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee recommended that a supplementary index excluding tobacco products should be published by the Central Statistics Office. I am informed by the CSO that such an index has been compiled and published as part of the monthly statement since January 1999.</P>

I am told by the Central Statistics Office that such an index has been compiled and published since January 1999. A second index is available which does not include the tobacco component. The Minister for Finance, in the Budget Statement, said he wanted to consider the question of including tobacco in inflation calculations.

In the 13 months since the report was published and laid before the House, has any initiative been taken to follow up this matter?

The joint committee made a recommendation that there be a supplementary index, but it also recommended that agreement be obtained from the EU for the removal of tobacco products from all EU consumer price baskets. I accept what Deputy Shatter says about the Belgian situation but it has been international practice until now to include tobacco in indices. The Minister for Finance is examining this matter.

Given the advice from the joint committee and the World Health Organisation that increasing tobacco taxes reduces youth smoking, does the Minister of State accept that any coherent policy to tackle the scourge of tobacco in this country should include annual increases on tobacco taxes? Does the Minister agree that the only reason there was not an increase this year was the fear of the impact of such an increase on the CPI? In the recent budget the Government decided to sacrifice the health of young people to keep down the cost of living statistics. This was necessary because of the failure of the Government, over 13 months to take any initiative to implement the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is consistently working to improve the range, detail and timeliness of its statistical products. Major developments have been put in place over the past few years, including significant improvements to economic statistics, driven by the needs of the EU, the addition of the quarterly national household survey to the statistical infrastructure, new releases in the business statistics area and increased coverage of the services sector.</P>
      <P>Developments in the area of economic statistics have included the introduction of quarterly national accounts, the new European system of accounts &ndash; ESA95 &ndash; and the putting in place of a new enhanced collection and compilation system for the balance of payments.</P>
      <P>In the demographic and social statistics area, the quarterly national household survey was initiated in 1997 and the priority objective of publishing the key results within three months is being achieved on a regular basis. Results from the 1996 census of population were available much quicker than for previous censuses and arrangements are in hand to achieve further improvements for the upcoming 2001 census. The consumer price index has been compiled on a monthly basis since January 1997 while results from the 1999-2000 household budget survey should be available in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>As regards business statistics, the rotating three-year coverage of the services sector has been upgraded to an annual cycle, the NACE classification has been introduced for the main industrial inquiries and an updated retail sales index was launched at the end of 1999. New information on stocks and capital investment has been published and new earnings estimates for certain service sectors were introduced in 2000.</P>
      <P>As regards access to statistics, the CSO has taken a number of initiatives in recent years. The release time of official statistics was brought forward to 11 a.m. to facilitate key users and the media. Statistical releases were revamped in the recent past to make them more user friendly and all are now posted on the CSO's website at the exact time of release.</P>
      <P>The CSO's website contains all the office's principal statistics and plans are in hand to improve its coverage and functionality. Arrangements are also in place to provide researchers with access to anonymised micro-data files, which is a major step in improving the availability of data.</P>
      <P>I welcome these developments, which have added to our national statistical infrastructure, and look forward to further developments by the CSO.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy studies my reply he will see it outlines the major developments undertaken by the CSO in recent years. There have been significant improvements in the areas of economic statistics, many driven by EUROSTAT and EU requirements, a new approach to the quarterly national household survey and a new series of statistics on business, housing and labour. There has also been the introduction of quarterly national accounts, the European system of accounts, developments in the consumer price index and so on.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is a new series of business statistics covering the services sector which is upgraded in annual cycles and so on. A range of initiatives have been taken which have resulted in the CSO being a more efficient and speedy organisation. The CSO has done a very professional job, particularly in the past two years.</P>

Companies which have to submit information to the CSO claim its requests are not clear, often ambiguous, time consuming and difficult to collate and that there is a duplication of requests from the CSO and other State bodies. Can we expect to see measures put in place where there would be one request from the CSO or other State bodies? Can we further expect to see a streamlining of the system through the installation of information technology systems, developed by the CSO, in these companies so that information can be electronically transferred to the CSO which would ensure the collation of information, avoid duplication, streamline the system and reduce the cost for industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is the State requires statistics from a range of sources and it sets out to obtain them. I recall chairing a small business forum some years ago to which a range of representatives of small businesses were invited. The forms required to be completed were laid out in front of them and they were asked to select the ones they would prefer to do without. Forms are required for the National Safety Council, housing reports, labour reports, safety and medical matters, insurance schemes and other areas across the board. All that information must be collected. I would welcome if the information required to be collected from small businesses could be whittled down to one large form. While I examined this matter in great detail a few years ago, it warrants a fresh examination to ascertain if the amount of bureaucracy that firms face can be reduced. The payback to firms is that they get a better service from the State because it has better information and is, therefore, able to make <Col N="16" /> better policy and that policy benefits companies. It is not the wish of the State to load companies with the requirement to complete numerous bureaucratic forms. I will take up the Deputy's point with the CSO to make sure it is not adding to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June last, the Government published Action on Housing, which set out a comprehensive package of measures, taking account of recommendations made by Dr. Bacon in his report and including a range of improvements to the social and affordable housing schemes. It is too early to assess the full impact of the measures taken in Action on Housing, but the indications to date are positive. House price increases are moderating, housing output has increased and first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stamp duty changes introduced in Action on Housing were designed to ease the burden on first time buyers and owner occupiers and to discourage speculative investment which was negatively impacting on the ability of first time buyers to enter the market. A temporary anti-speculative property tax was also introduced to discourage short-term speculative investment by those seeking to make a quick capital gain, with exemptions for landlords who comply with specific regulatory requirements, indicating a commitment to the <Col N="17" /> long-term availability of the accommodation for renting. The measures introduced to discourage speculative investment do not affect the existing supply of rented accommodation. On the other hand, speculative investment provides little long-term accommodation in the rental sector and by driving up house prices also fuels rent increases. The increasing share of first time buyers in the market, as a result of measures to curb speculative investment, should ease somewhat the demand for private rented accommodation and moderate the rate of increase in rents, as those potential first time purchasers had previously been forced into private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>Measures to improve the position of tenants in the private rented residential sector have been introduced in the last two budgets. The ceiling for income tax relief in respect of rent paid by tenants under 55 has doubled. In the case of tenants over 55 a doubling of the ceiling, coupled with standard rating of the relief means that 80% of such tenants gain a doubling of relief. Further measures to increase the availability of private rented accommodation announced in the recent budget include a rent-a-room scheme which provides for an exemption from income tax in respect of gross rental income of up to £6,000 per annum, for accommodation provided in a person's principal private residence.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>This measure will facilitate the provision of accommodation thereby easing the pressure on the private rented sector and will improve the utilisation of the housing stock.</P>
    <P>I understand that the projected increase of 20% in rents referred to by the Deputy relates to rental properties in premium locations in Dublin and not the wider private rented residential market.</P>
    <P>I established a Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector which reported in July last. The commission identified a growing need for accommodation in the private rented sector and set out a number of recommendations to increase supply, including recommendations aimed at increasing long-term investment in private rented accommodation. The commission also recommended improvements to the regulatory regime for the private rented residential sector with a view to ensuring full compliance with the requirements of the regulations on registration, rent books and standards. The Government is considering its response to the report of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's long winded reply did not deal with the question. The question asked if he is aware that the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, Threshold, representing tenants and the Irish Property Owners Association have all said that there is a standstill in investment in new private residential accommodation because of the Government's measures, such as the third Bacon report. Is he <Col N="18" /> also aware that people have estimated that the annual requirement is an extra 33,000 units a year and the Government's policy has brought this to a standstill? Will he explain why there was no response in the budget to the commission's recommendations on investment in private rented accommodation? The result of all this will be higher rents.</P>

The commission also recommended improvements in the regulatory regime for the private rented residential sector with a view to ensuring full compliance with the requirements of regulations &ndash; registration, rent books and standards.</P>
      <P>The Government is actively considering its response to the report of the commission and appropriate measures will be introduced by the Government when it has concluded its consideration of the matter. I am anxious that this happens as soon as possible. The Deputy must bear in mind that when the Government introduced the 9% stamp duty level it was done for a specific purpose and that has had an effect. Developers are rethinking a lot of their planning and many developments are now more focused on first time buyers and starter homes than was the case previously, when developers were pitching their plans and buildings at investors. We know what that did to the availability of houses for first time buyers. Government policy in this area is working. Things do not work overnight.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the figures published recently by Simon Outreach which suggested an increase in the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin city centre and I am also aware that there was a degree of selectivity in the data published. The published figures indicated results of counts of homeless persons sleeping rough for 1998 and 1997 but omitted the 1999 results. Moreover, the figures for 1997 and 1998 appear to have been understated.</P>
      <P>Had the 1999 figures been included, it would have revealed a significant reduction in the number of homeless persons sleeping rough in the city centre. However, I do not wish to attribute motives behind the omission of one year's data and figures which are open to dispute for earlier years. However, I believe that some reduction in the number of persons sleeping rough in Dublin has been recorded and this is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the issue of statistics, I am concerned that even one person should be homeless and forced to sleep on the streets of Dublin or anywhere else. The homeless strategy which I launched in May this year called for additional night-time services to be provided for homeless persons, particularly in Dublin. Local authorities are currently preparing action plans which will detail the services that will be provided for homeless persons, including additional facilities and accommodation for people who are forced to sleep rough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the action plan for Dublin, which is <Col N="20" /> due to be considered by the housing strategic policy committees of the four Dublin authorities shortly, additional facilities and emergency accommodation will be provided for those sleeping rough. However, as it will take some time for these to be put in place, my Department recently asked Dublin Corporation to urgently develop proposals to provide additional night-time service facilities which would provide people on the streets with basic shelter and food at night-time as an emergency interim measure. I am happy that the manager's report to me recently showed that progress is being made on that matter.</P>

I refer particularly to the Focus Ireland report. In attempting to downplay the Simon report, is the Minister of State saying that those are all wrong? Is he suggesting that the number of homeless people is in decline rather than increasing, as all reports show?</P>
      <P>In a country teeming with money, is the Minister of State not ashamed, given his responsibility for housing, that 1,200 children are homeless in Dublin at present? Is he taking measures to requisition emergency accommodation for those homeless people, particularly now in the run-up to Christmas? </P>

      <P>The figures published by Simon were as follows: 2,002 persons in this year's count compared to 149 in 1998 and 125 in 1997. Dublin Corporation claims the actual figure is 202 persons this year in comparison with 261 in 1999, 208 in 1998 and 265 in 1997. I understand that Dublin Corporation has seriously questioned the accuracy of the published comparisons and there are issues to be answered by Simon Outreach &ndash; why the 1999 figure was not quoted is puzzling to say the least. This would indicate there was a drop in the numbers of street homeless in the recent count compared to 1999. However, as I indicated in my reply, my main concern&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have taken extreme measures to seek to ensure that adequate provision is made for this. We have doubled the capital allocation and increased the current allocation. We have asked the local authorities to draw up housing initiative proposals for the provision of accommodation for the homeless. The Government has done everything it possibly can regarding money and planning to get local authorities to provide <Col N="21" /> these facilities within their areas as quickly as possible. In the Dublin area substantial progress is being made and, as I said, the strategic policy committees will be considering the matter soon.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's last point, special provision is being made in Dublin to deal with the situation in the interim, before the refurbished buildings are available, so temporary accommodation is being provided in the short-term to ensure there is some place for people.</P>
      <P>People sleep rough for a variety of reasons, not all of which relate to the availability of accommodation of whatever quality. People sleep rough by choice.</P>

The medium-term plan is being drawn up. It has taken longer than the corporation hoped but it asked me for an extension of time and I felt it better to get it right than force it to meet a deadline. We have agreed to that and I understand the plan is very comprehensive. All the councillors will have sight of it, though most have probably seen it already as it is coming up for discussion soon. There is no shortage of funding but there are difficulties with sites. There is opposition from councillors and the public in certain areas. The route ahead is not straightforward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 6th Conference of the Parties, COP6, to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change took place in The Hague from 13 to 25 November. While Ireland was represented at the full session, I attended from Sunday, 19 November to the final day, including the full ministerial segment of the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish position was developed as part of the overall EU negotiating position with the primary aims of ensuring that the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol was maintained enabling sufficient parties to ratify it so that it could enter into force by &ldquo;Rio+10&rdquo;, the 10th anniversary of the 1992 Earth Summit. I worked with my EU ministerial colleagues towards these ends in a ser<Col N="22" /> ies of discussions and negotiations with Ministers and other Government representatives from all over the world.</P>
    <P>The rules, modalities and guidelines for the operation of the flexible mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, including international emissions trading, were on the agenda, and significant progress was made in regard to many issues related to these. Final agreement was not reached on the flexible mechanisms, as the COP failed to reach overall political agreement on a number of issues, including, first, specifying how the requirement for emissions trading to be supplemental to domestic action should be provided for; second, whether and how additional categories of carbon sinks might be included for the purposes of parties meeting their Kyoto obligations; third, the overall compliance obligations to apply; and, fourth, the arrangements, including financial assistance, for supporting developing countries in addressing climate change.</P>
    <P>I am confident that with ongoing discussion, COP, on its resumption next May, will take the necessary decisions to meet the EU requirements as I have outlined them. Accordingly, the Government is proceeding with the implementation of the national climate change strategy to reduce current levels of emissions and meet our 13% limitation target under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Ireland, having obtained the fourth most generous Kyoto Protocol concession in the world, is one of the most serious overshoots in that we are already 20% over the 13% threshold and heading for 40% by the year 2010? Will the Minister indicate when an emissions trading system will be in place in Europe? Is he satisfied that other Departments, such as the Department of Public Enterprise in relation to electricity generation, have bought into the Government strategy when it is not the case that combined heat and power plants, say, under 25 megawatts can be set up for small industrial units? There is no system of green credits being put in place for electricity suppliers as is the case in the United Kingdom. Does the Minister have any proposals in relation to his own area to alter VRT for cars with low or no emissions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect when he says that we have the fourth most generous limitations level in the world. A significant number of signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have no limitations whatsoever. We have the fourth most generous limitation within the EU bubble, which is an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the figures we have, the Deputy will be aware that the national climate change strategy was published prior to the conference in The Hague, COP6. In that strategy there was a clearly laid out Government policy statement, not a Department of the Environment and Local Government statement, in which all Departments committed themselves to a variety of targets to <Col N="23" /> reduce the levels of emissions so that we comply with the 13% plus limitation imposed on us.</P>
    <P>In relation to the emissions trading, no agreement was finalised on the flexible mechanisms. At the same time as the national climate change strategy we published a document of our own on emissions trading. We intend to fully participate in an emissions trading programme within the EU initially and post 2008 internationally, which was the timescale envisaged at Kyoto. We will be fully involved in the emissions trading regime at that stage and we will be part of the international emissions trading programme when it comes into place but it cannot come into place until the Kyoto Protocol is ratified by the required number of states. That means COP6 resuming and, hopefully, a resolution found in COP6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position in relation to Moneypoint, the largest carbon emissions plant in the country? Is it to close or is it to convert to natural gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will play a major role in the national climate change strategy. It was clearly laid out in that strategy that the closure or conversion of Moneypoint would make the largest single contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Government has declared its intention in the national climate change strategy to ensure that measures to address the energy supplies sector will be supportive of the ceasing of coal firing at Moneypoint by 2008. The options in relation to Moneypoint post 2008 are a matter for the ESB but the key change that could be made is a change to gas fired by 2008.</P>

Will he ask the ASTI if it will consider a suggestion made in a letter from a principal of a second level school to a newspaper today that it enter the PPF until next September and that the Minister fast-track the benchmarking so that teachers will see his bona fides in what comes out of the benchmarking and ensure that classes are not disrupted after the Christmas holidays?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the teachers were not prepared to work within the PPF and wanted 30% on the table outside the PPF and to talk about the PPF after that. We advanced through various discussions to last week when we met again. I assured the ASTI chief executives that the Government and partners were working in the context of the budget to deal with the issues raised by Deputy Quinn and the issue raised by Deputy Owen about fast-tracking benchmarking. The partners have agreed a means of bringing forward benchmarking and it has been brought forward. They have also agreed a means of dealing with the drift in inflation. These two issues were difficult ones for all the partners but they were resolved last week. That resolution has been welcomed by all the parties.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the ASTI today &ndash; I have been in contact with it virtually daily. The impression has been given that I am not prepared to meet it. I previously said in the House that I was in contact with it and was prepared to meet it and it was a question of when it considered it appropriate to meet me. As the Deputies know, we subsequently met. We now have the outcome of the discussions with the partners and the budget, so I wrote to the ASTI today to tell it I was disappointed and dismayed at the decision to escalate industrial action and to include more strike days and a ban on co-operation with the junior and leaving certificate examinations.</P>

Under the new measures the salary of a new recruit will increase from £18,990 to £24,743, an increase of £5,733 over two years. In the case of a principal of a medium-sized school, this amounts to an increase of £9,950 to £55,987. This is the effect of the PPF, which I do not think is widely understood. This is before the benefits of the benchmarking process.</P>

      <P>Last week the Chair made a ruling whereby Deputy Bruton as Leader of the Fine Gael Party was allowed to ask questions on this matter and Deputy Shortall, who is not yet the leader of the Labour Party, was entitled to ask questions as her party's spokesperson on education.

If the Minister set up such a commission, he might at least make some innovative suggestions which could be the ingredient to bring this strike to an end.

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to give full technical effect to the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, relating to the national salmon resource. The 1999 Act, which was enacted in December of last year, provided for a complete overhaul of the management, organis<Col N="40" /> ation and service delivery of the inland fisheries sector. In the period of almost one year since the commencement of the Act, the new boards are in place and full roll-out of the new framework is under way.</P>
    <P>One of the other principal innovations of the 1999 Act was to provide for the establishment of the National Salmon Commission on a statutory basis. The establishment of the commission was one of the key recommendations of the salmon management task force which reported in June 1996. The task force created a blueprint for consensus on salmon strategies by giving esteem to all players and acknowledging the roles and responsibilities of all. Under the 1999 Act, the salmon commission has the function of assisting and advising in relation to salmon conservation and management strategies. On coming into office, I moved immediately to put the commission in place. In March I signed the order establishing the commission and appointed the chairman and 20 ordinary members. These members are representative of all the stakeholders in salmon, that is, the commercial sector, the recreational angling sector, the aquaculture sector and processors. It also includes the fisheries boards, the Marine Institute and the ESB. The commission has a pivotal role to play in advising on and shaping salmon strategies, on a consensus basis, into the future.</P>
    <P>The salmon management task force also recommended a system of carcase tagging for wild salmon which was to form part of a management model for the equitable sharing of the resource between all legitimate interests. This management model was to be implemented on catchment scale and envisaged the setting of a total allowable catch and quotas for the taking of salmon. These wide ranging recommendations of the task force were the subject of a further technical report by the Marine Institute which advised on the technical aspects of implementation. Subsequently, a detailed practical assessment of the implementation strategy for salmon tagging was carried out by the salmon management working group which represented the fisheries boards, the Marine Institute and my Department. Taken together, all these reports created a framework to progress the implementation of tagging.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Act enabled the making of regulations, following consultation with the salmon commission, for a national scheme of tagging for wild salmon. When I established the commission, I requested immediate priority to be given to progressing tagging as the next practical step forward in quantifying and managing salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>The objective of the salmon tagging scheme is to provide information on catches by the commercial and recreational fishing sectors. The real time management information provided by the tagging programme will help us to quantify salmon in a new way. The data provided by tagging and a radically upgraded national fish counter programme will critically inform future salmon conservation and management strategies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> Section 24 of the 1999 Act provided for the making of regulations to underpin the salmon tagging scheme following consultation with the National Salmon Commission and following a period of 30 days for public consultation.</P>
    <P>At its inaugural meeting in April, the commission agreed the publication of the draft regulations. Following detailed consideration by the commission itself and the 30 day consultation period, the commission advised that I should sign the regulations with an effective date for implementation of 1 January 2001. In giving its advice, the commission also consulted the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute. On receipt of this advice and in light of the public consultative process, I was pleased to sign the regulations and move ahead with the preparations for the introduction of tagging from 1 January.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my thanks to the chairman of the commission, Professor Noel Wilkins, and the commission as a whole for its timely and constructive advice to me in relation to the tagging scheme. The high level of consensus supporting the introduction of the scheme is in large part due to the vision of commission members. They chose to recognise the shared nature of the salmon resource and delivered on the opportunity presented by the comprehensive scoping and technical preparatory work which had gone before. I know that over a number of meetings the commission analysed the provisions of the draft regulations in detail and made many improvements which I was pleased to accept. This work will ensure the operation of the scheme is both effective and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have provided additional resources to the fisheries boards to undertake a public information campaign to ensure that fishermen, salmon dealers and members of the public are well informed regarding the main elements of the scheme, its objective and their responsibilities under the regulations. The measures include advertisements in newspapers and fishing publications, information booklets, mailshots to holders of fishing licences and posters. The fisheries boards have also put in place a comprehensive preparatory programme prior to the introduction of tagging on 1 January, including training programmes for staff in the regions.</P>
    <P>Prior to final settlement of the tagging regulations in the summer, the Parliamentary Counsel advised me that it would be legally necessary for offences and penalties to be provided for in primary legislation rather than by regulations, which had been provided for in the 1999 Act. This advice was subsequently endorsed by the Attorney General. Accordingly, preparation of this Bill was put in hand immediately. As Deputies will appreciate, it is an essential adjunct to the tagging regulations themselves.</P>
    <P>My immediate priority has been to secure the co-operation of all players in the tagging and counting of wild salmon as an essential management tool. The tagging scheme is simply a data <Col N="42" /> collection scheme designed to provide a verifiable count of the national catch by all. Tags and logbooks will be available free of charge under the regulations and additional tags will be available to holders of licences subject only to compliance with the regulations. The data will critically inform conservation and management strategies in future years.</P>
    <P>Tagging is not an end in itself &ndash; it is a means to the end. Decision making based on real and comprehensive information is the fundamental objective. My principal policy objective is to increase returns of salmon, thus enhancing the availability of stocks for tourism and domestic sport angling to the national benefit. However, it is without question that all sectors must play their part where catch and escapement data show that stocks are under threat. No sector will be relieved of the obligation to reduce their share of mortality on salmon in catchments at risk. I look to all salmon interests to recognise and accept that shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that tagging is only one practical step on a new road to restore our fantastic wild salmon stocks. There is a great deal more to be done on a range of complex challenges facing the salmon resource. We also need to reflect developments in thinking since the Salmon Task Force reported four years ago and the commission itself will need to analyse all aspects of salmon conservation and management in the light of developments. Accordingly, I invited the salmon commission in early summer to develop advice and analysis on expanding and upgrading the national fish counter programme, enhanced spring salmon conservation strategies, catchment management strategies, the water quality challenge, incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort and predation. I look forward to receiving the commission's advice on these and other issues in the near future.</P>
    <P>We need to move ahead with this wide ranging agenda and other salmon conservation priorities informed over time by the accurate statistics which tagging and counters will provide. Deputies will be aware of recent reports regarding proposals for a buy-out of commercial salmon licences for six figure sums. These proposals have no official status. There is a long-standing body of opinion here and abroad which sees buyout of commercial licences as the key to restoration of stocks. The situation is far more complex in reality. Experience internationally is mixed. I am awaiting the consensus advice of the commission in the first instance but I stress that overall policy will be informed by all the factors at work. I would especially stress the tangible benefits to be gained through all stakeholders co-operating in the catchment management process. It must also reflect the legitimate entitlements of commercial fishermen as stakeholders in the resource. In that context, I would point out that significant restrictions have already been imposed on seasons and fishing days for drift and draft nets.</P>
    <P>At present we are co-financing two pilot <Col N="43" /> schemes at catchment level for voluntary set-aside of commercial fishing engines for salmon. Both of these schemes are based on matching contributions by other stakeholders and I have asked all the regional fisheries boards to encourage the development of similar projects based on consensus and local contribution. Funding is available for such schemes subject to value for money considerations, local stakeholder contributions and demonstrable benefits for salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I also commend to Deputies the long-standing salmon management model in place in the Foyle. Based on real time stock data and spawning targets, fishing effort by commercial and angling interests is managed and adjusted each season. The work of the Foyle Fisheries Commission over the last 40 years is a fine example of salmon management at its best.</P>
    <P>Turning to the main provisions of the Bill, section 2 provides for a system of on-the-spot fines for offences in the area of inland fisheries. I take the opportunity presented by the Bill to provide for a comprehensive system of on-the-spot fines building on the provisions in the 1999 Act, which provided for such a system in relation to the tagging scheme. This system will operate in a similar fashion to the on-the-spot fine system for minor traffic offences and will be administered by the fisheries boards. It will result in more efficient use of resources and reduce the costs and administrative burdens associated with taking prosecutions for minor offences. The money collected by the boards from the payment of on-the-spot fines will be used by them in the delivery of services to the inland fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>I endorse the importance of adding in this way to the operational options available to the boards in the performance of their duties. The staff of the boards often face difficult challenges in their everyday conservation and protection work. It is up to us as legislators to ensure they have the effective means to carry out their duties in an efficient and reasonable way.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 provide for the necessary technical amendments to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to create offences and penalties in relation to the salmon tagging scheme. The more serious offences which attract higher maximum penalties are provided for in four new subsections. Necessary consequential amendments are provided for in relation to on-the-spot fines and consequential disqualification orders.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the next election year for elections of members to regional boards shall be 2005, which restores the standard five year period. It is intended that the elections in 2005 will be held in December, which has been the norm for practical administrative reasons since the establishment of the boards under the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the terms of office of the appointed members can be extended up to <Col N="44" /> the time of the next election, thus providing for continuity of board membership. Section 7 is an amendment proposed by the Attorney General in relation to staff members of boards who are appointed board members. Under the 1959 Act, no member of the regional board shall be eligible for paid office with the board. The amendment clarifies the position of staff appointees in this regard. Section 8 provides for the restoration of several subsections of the 1980 Act which were inadvertently deleted by the 1999 Act.</P>
    <P>This short Bill provides primarily for technical amendments to give effect to what was intended in the 1999 Act in relation to the salmon tagging scheme. I hope Deputies can agree that the tagging scheme, backed up by effective and reasonable sanctions, will deliver vital management information to inform conservation strategies from now on. The information on the catch of wild salmon will be used as input into the sustainable and equitable management of the salmon resource involving all the legitimate interests. I look forward, with the support of the House, to its successful implementation to the benefit of all and of the salmon resource itself. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the objectives it is trying to achieve. On reading the deliberations in the Seanad and having listened to what the Minister had to say, it appears on face value to be a simple Bill. As I understand it, we are here primarily to enable the Oireachtas affirm what the Minister will sign by regulation and, but for that, this Bill would not have been introduced. Against this background the Attorney General believed that the new on-the-spot fines could not be put in place by regulation and that this process would have to be gone through.</P>
      <P>From studying the Bill in greater depth and from speaking to some of those involved in it, a few fundamental questions arise. Nobody in the industry, at every level, would disagree with the Minister's proposals. However, further clarification on some of the Bill's provisions will be required from him, both in this debate and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Not everybody is satisfied with the Bill, but that is to be expected. Some are unhappy with certain elements and the question of protection staff and the fisheries boards raises concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a salmon tagging scheme to provide information on the fish caught by the commercial and recreational fish sectors. This should help management to quantify the salmon in a new way. It will now be possible to know where salmon are landed, how many have been caught, their size, etc. This data, together with the radically upgraded national fish counter programme which counts fish on the river, will form the future basis of whatever conservation and management strategies will be needed. I understand a plethora of organisations are involved in consultation with <Col N="45" /> the National Salmon Commission. I understand public consideration was given to all over 30 days.</P>
    <P>This is an entirely different tagging procedure from the micro tagging system used for the movement of live fish, smolts and so on. Some people seem to have difficulty understanding that we are talking about carcase tagging. This is a more scientific tagging system which occurs when fish are caught. Another distinction is that we are talking about wild, not farmed salmon.</P>
    <P>I understand the tags and log book will be available free of charge under the legislation. Many people want to know how long that will last. I remember it was not long after the introduction of ear tags for cattle that farmers had to pay for them. I have tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which will give the Minister an opportunity to state his position in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention to charge for tagging at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now put that on the record. I am concerned that at some stage, long after the Minister and I are gone, someone will charge for the tags once the system is in operation.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to identify where the stocks of salmon are, in the same way as it is difficult to identify where the herring shoals and other types of fish are all over the world. It is almost impossible to get a scientific formula which stands up in all circumstances. Many fishermen have told me during the past year that, irrespective of the scientific knowledge available, certain types of fish will turn up in certain areas out of the blue. For that reason, it is extraordinarily difficult to know what is happening in the sea. I presume it is the same for salmon and that is what the Department and the fisheries boards are trying to deal with. Sometimes fish will disappear from a river, even when pollution is not a factor, and then come back again several years later. This tagging system will ensure we know where they are when they are caught.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the tagging of fish will oblige the various sectors to reduce the share of salmon mortality in their catchment areas. The Minister referred to that in his speech. I am not aware of the logical connection between caught salmon which is tagged and any malpractices which would allow fish to die unnecessarily. I understand the National Salmon Commission, under Professor Wilkins of the National University of Ireland, Galway, made a huge effort in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the commission is drawn from all walks of life and the fishing industry. It has tried to come up with a reasonable list of initiatives to give a better return of fish, which will help everyone concerned. I understand it looked at the upgrading of the national fish counter programme. Perhaps the Minister might outline the position in that regard. It also looked at the enhancement of the spring salmon conser<Col N="46" /> vation strategies, the catchment management strategies, the water quality problem, incentives to reduce the commercial fishing effort and other such matters. Fish tagging is the first step on a long ladder.</P>
    <P>On the proposals to buy out commercial salmon licences, any change in this area must reflect the entitlements of legitimate commercial fishermen who have spent a lifetime as stakeholders in this resource. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the basis of the voluntary set aside scheme for the commercial fishing engines used in salmon fishing. I am not sure what is involved in this area. I assume there is a curtailment on engine power. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if there are time or capacity constraints. Who will pay for the loss of earnings? The farming community is well used to set aside. While some people have problems with the principle of it, it has been useful for different reasons.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the fishing industry, particularly those involved in farmed salmon, is not happy with the tagging of salmon. They are afraid that wild salmon could be sold as farmed salmon under certain conditions. That would be difficult to identify and it would require extra vigilance by the protection staff. I know this is a pilot project but if there is a distortion in the next couple of years, the Department and the fisheries board must look at ways of dealing with it. This will be a problem, although I do not know if it will be a big one.</P>
    <P>Some anglers who fish as a pastime find it repugnant that they must tag the carcase as they land it and tell everyone about it. I accept the Department's view that they may not have the privilege of catching fish unless there are fish to be caught. The people with an interest in fishing for recreation and in getting fresh air believe they should be allowed to catch fish without telling anyone. It is not too long ago since we had a row about the freedom to fish. It is against that background that I ask the Minister to reply to this point.</P>
    <P>We are talking about salmon conservation and about management strategies to ensure we build up the salmon stocks. There is no spy in the sky, so to speak. This is a matter entirely between fishermen, the Department and the fishery boards. This is the way to go about their legitimate business and, once they stick to the rules, that will be an end to it.</P>
    <P>What I regard as the most important part of the Bill relates to fisheries boards which always appear to be strapped for cash. This is not a personal criticism of the Minister because this was going on long before he took up office. As fisheries boards have developed, many worthwhile projects have been implemented and the fisheries boards, by and large, are doing an excellent job. My discussions with them have always revolved around the fact that they have many plans but not much money. What appears to have been lacking over the years is fishery protection staff. I do not <Col N="47" /> wish to have a police State, because we do not have the mentality for that sort of thing, but it is very important to be able to enforce the laws enacted in this House. In the three fisheries boards with which I am familiar &ndash; I am sure the same applies in all of them &ndash; unless the Minister is prepared to provide greater staffing, particularly protection staff, there will be very few on-the-spot fines. This is a good scheme and I am sure most people will agree that the Minister did a good day's work in introducing this legislation. However, many genuinely interested people believe it will not work unless something is done about employing more protection staff.</P>
    <P>The report of the salmon management working committee refers to the fact that one protection officer per area is employed on a temporary basis. My understanding is that the fishery business is totally uncontrolled. I hope the Minister can refute what I am saying but it is a generally held belief that there are no controls in this area. I do not expect to see a protection officer, formerly known as a water bailiff, hanging out of every bridge on every river, but if the regional fishery authorities are not funded to the degree necessary to implement this legislation, people with an interest in the salmon industry in all its glory believe we are wasting our time here today. We are not at the races in this regard because the industry is so under-manned and under-funded. I do not object in principle to on-the-spot fines which work reasonably well for traffic offences but, I do not have to point out to the House that if we want a scheme to work, we must put the staff in place to police it. On our inland waterways, one could currently walk from Dingle to Connemara and not meet two protection officers.</P>
    <P>The legislation should be stronger with regard to fishery protection and I hope the Minister will indicate this in his reply. The explanatory memorandum reads, &ldquo;There are no exchequer costs or staffing implications associated with the Bill. The enabling provisions for on-the-spot fines in relation to fisheries offences will result in more efficient use of the resources of the fisheries boards and will reduce the State's legal costs associated with taking prosecutions, etc.&rdquo;. This seems to indicate that money will not be provided, even though it is expected there will have to be one officer in each fishery area. Obviously, this is a contradiction. If we do not get the protection aspect right, the legislation will mean nothing and I would not like that to be the case.</P>
    <P>There is a concerted effort throughout the country to reduce the level of pollution in our rivers. Whether we tag fish, including salmon, will mean nothing if we poison the rivers. The farming community receives a very bad press with regard to river pollution. Over the years Governments have made available substantial funding to control farmyard pollution. The REP scheme was introduced to help farmers reduce the fertiliser levels being applied and new slatted houses are being built throughout the country. Tests now <Col N="48" /> being carried out in many rivers show that farm pollution is not increasing; in fact, it is decreasing in many instances. The same should apply to other types of pollution. It is very important to have adequate supervision of our rivers so that staff can monitor pollution and so on.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will sign this legislation into law for 1 January. It appears that tagging was a fundamental first step in Canada and in Maine in the United States. I note that the United Kingdom did not introduce this provision, which I find unusual because they have been considering it for ten or 15 years. I wonder why? I mentioned wild salmon being sold. As far as Bord Bia's quality assurance scheme for farm salmon is concerned, it is very important that it is able to sell a food product which is not tainted, and I believe it is doing a good job.</P>
    <P>I note a national administrator is being proposed to oversee this scheme. I assume he or she will be appointed from the Central Fisheries Board. Given that there will be no Exchequer costs, who will pay him or her? Will this come from the Central Fisheries Board's funding? It seems to me that we are enacting legislation to give the regional fisheries boards more responsibility but we are not giving them the money to carry out their rightful duties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I will table amendments tomorrow to which I hope the Minister will have satisfactory answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the Bill. During the debate on the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, I pointed out the need to introduce measures such as those contained in the Bill, which is technical in nature. I welcome the general thrust of the Bill, but I wish to make a number of comments about the question of tagging.</P>
      <P>I agree that the provisions of the Bill relating to salmon tagging can be implemented and applied in the catchment areas. I refer here to salmon of which account is taken in the official system. I do not know what is the position in Galway, but I am aware of that which applies on the east coast because I am a keen angler and my family is involved in the draft net fishing industry. The Minister should take note of the fact that 40% or more of the salmon caught on rivers on the east coast are sold by those who caught them out of the backs of their cars.</P>
      <P>On rivers in my constituency one will often see signs which state &ldquo;For sale &ndash; salmon&rdquo;. A person will drive up and approach the person selling the salmon and inquire how many salmon he has for sale. They will haggle with each other over the price and usually £10, £20, £40 or some other amount will change hands. On many occasions I have seen the total catch from the River Boyne being sold to tourists and others wanting to obtain fresh salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how the tagging system will apply to this trade in salmon? In the context of the set-aside or buy-out system which will eventually emerge, how does one quantify the <Col N="49" /> number of salmon caught and sold in the way to which I refer? The figures supplied to me by the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Woods, in reply to many Dáil questions indicate that the salmon catch for the past five years reached a certain level. However, those figures are completely false because between 40% and 50% of the salmon caught are not recorded. The Minister will be obliged to address this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton who referred to the policing and supervision of the provisions relating to tagging. In light of the number of staff currently employed by the fisheries boards, it would not be possible to supervise every river on the east and west coasts. If we were to insist on such supervision, full-time staff would have to be on duty on a 24 hour basis during the various fishing seasons.</P>
    <P>I served as chairman of the salmon task force for a year. In discussing this matter with the various fishing interests from throughout the country, I discovered that people from the east, south and west had completely different points of view. It was virtually impossible to reach a consensus in terms of dealing with the issue of the control and conservation of salmon stocks. However, one matter in particular came to the fore during the task force's discussions, namely, that it would not be possible for the fisheries boards to take action in respect of illegal salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have stated that this matter is political in nature. In my opinion the decline in the number of salmon in our rivers is due to one thing, drift net fishing. Successive Governments, regardless of their political hue, have refused to bite the bullet on this issue because it would not be in their political interests to do so. They fear that they would offend too many of those involved in the salmon fishing industry on the west and north-west coasts. The number of salmon caught on the west coast is substantially greater than the number caught on the east coast. This is due to the fact that drift net fishing is killing the supply of salmon to rivers on the east coast. Successive Governments have refused to deal with this problem because they would lose too many votes in the west.</P>
    <P>More salmon are caught through the use of drift nets than through all other means. Every country in the world except Ireland has eliminated the practice of drift net fishing. Successive Ministers have said that action will be taken in small stages. Even those operating in the drift net industry recognise that the level of their catch has substantially reduced the numbers of salmon entering our rivers.</P>
    <P>The Minister can refer to tagging and pollution, but he will be wasting his time until he decides to take action in respect of drift net fishing. He can tag all the fish he wants but most of these are caught in drift nets, a development which is leading to the demise of wild salmon.</P>
    <P>I have wanted to highlight this matter for a long period. If, in the future, I have a say in relation to the question of the conservation of sal<Col N="50" /> mon stocks, I would completely eliminate drift net fishing and give those involved in the industry suitable compensation. The salmon stocks in rivers on both the east and west coasts would be restored over a ten or 15 year period as a result.</P>
    <P>The other matter about which I am concerned is whether we should establish a set-aside or a buy-out system. This matter has been the subject of discussion for a long period. If there is to be a buy-out, it cannot be done on a piecemeal basis. The Department would have to buy out every draft net fishing interest in a particular catchment area for that system to work.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with a number of fishermen who stated, &ldquo;Of the 60 licences which apply to a particular location we will sell 40 back to the Department and keep the remainder&rdquo;. I am completely opposed to this practice. The Department must purchase every licence that applies to a particular catchment area because if the fishermen to whom I refer were allowed to retain 20 licences they would catch as many fish as they would if they retained all 60.</P>
    <P>While there may be 60 licences in a catchment area, only ten or 15 boats may be fishing in the area. The Minister should address himself to this issue.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore who, as Minister of State, initiated many of the programmes which are now in operation. He had a real grasp of the subject and this is recognised by rod and net fishermen and in every section of the industry. I also pay tribute to Dr. Whitaker, himself a fisherman, who helped to highlight the problems associated with wild salmon. The documents he and his committee produced contain the solutions to many of these problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but only as a minor contribution to the conservation of wild salmon. Until a Government eliminates drift net fishing we will be wasting our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which gives full technical effect to the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999. I am delighted that we still have a will to discuss the issue of salmon fishing. Some will ask if any salmon are left in our seas and rivers. This legislation will help to deal with the problem of the disappearance of an important resource. We must take seriously the question of conservation and the management of our salmon fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister commended the Foyle fishery as one of the best examples of a long-standing salmon management model. The management of the Foyle fishery is based on real time stock data and spawning targets and fishing effort by commercial and angling interests and is managed and adjusted each season. I live on the Foyle and I agree that the fishery has been to the forefront in developing systems for counting and tagging although it has been criticised on the questions of closures, pricing and the availability of licences. <Col N="51" /> However, any agency might expect such criticism from people who are so close to the industry.</P>
    <P>The limitation of the length of the season and of fishing days will not be a big issue for people who fish on the Foyle. They have already fought that fight. Their season and fishing day is shorter than anywhere else in the country. The Foyle fishermen have often felt aggrieved at having to cease fishing when fishermen in other areas were allowed to continue. I hope they will not be unique for very much longer.</P>
    <P>The Foyle fishermen live close to Lough Swilly. A licence to fish in Lough Foyle costs almost twice as much as a licence to fish in Lough Swilly yet Lough Foyle fishermen must buy a separate licence if they wish to fish in Lough Swilly. I hope new cross-Border co-operation measures will end the differences between lengths of fishing days, pricing and seasonal closures on Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly. The availability of licences has been a controversial matter in Lough Foyle. The Minister has met fishermen and has dealt with many of their problems as they have arisen. I hope his Department will take a close interest in the development of fishing on Lough Foyle.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of poaching is taking place. This is a huge problem which must be resolved. The poaching of a scarce resource damages commercial fishing, angling and tourism. Resources are needed for the policing of rivers and also for research and development by the various boards. Many fishermen ask what is the point of inspectors driving about in marked vans which can be seen for miles. Policing cannot be done effectively if a sufficient number of inspectors is not employed to do the work. I know the Minister understands the seriousness of this problem and I ask him to consider it carefully. Who will impose on-the-spot fines if we do not have sufficient personnel?</P>
    <P>We must ensure that wild salmon are not sub-bred by escapees from fish farms. Wild salmon are a valuable resource and must be protected.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to set-aside. There is considerable aquacultural development in Lough Foyle and those involved are dealing constructively with this issue. They are working together, leaving the stock and taking advice from experts as to when to harvest and which areas of the lough to cultivate. They are doing this without the support of legislation. It is scandalous that people have invested years of work in moving seed mussels into beds and worked with BIM to develop a management strategy yet any person could take their stocks without fear of any sanction. I ask the Minister to expedite the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. The current legislation was passed in the early 1950s and needs to be updated. People involved in the aquaculture industry have acted very responsibly and have made a valuable contribution to the fishing industry. The least we can do is to give them legislative support.</P>
    <P>All the activities on Lough Foyle must be man<Col N="52" /> aged and co-ordinated. Never has there been so much activity on our waters. Activities include water ski-ing, jet ski-ing, swimming, fish farming, angling and commercial fishing and shipping. This is important. The CLAMS initiative has been very effective and should be expanded, particularly on the Foyle, as it is one of the better ways of moving forward. Nothing will work if imposed from above, but only if there is local agreement. As regards poaching, it may be naive to suggest that the initiative would be a way of bringing people acting outside the law into line.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to thank the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Woods, for the investment they secured for the fishing industry. This investment was badly needed and has been welcomed as it provided an unprecedented infrastructure in Donegal.</P>

      <P>I could mention Deputy Barrett's record. The last time he was in Greencastle the boys hardly went to see him. However, I do not want to go down the road of being political. There has been serious investment since this Government took office. This investment has been very welcome as it provided boats, piers and harbours. However, we are coming from such a low base that this process must continue and I congratulate the Minister on the increase in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>A ferry service will soon begin on the Foyle and work has begun on the infrastructure for the project. However, as in the case of the salmon and agriculture industries, moneys will be badly spent if there is a lack of co-ordination. As regards the ferry service, there is a need for dredging to allow fishermen access to the harbour. Instead of bringing in the dredger twice, improved co-operation would result in economies of scale. Greencastle will have to put its harbour regulations in place. If fishermen are responsible enough to seek harbour regulations, I trust the Minister will be able to expedite the work which needs to be done to develop the breakwater at Greencastle.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude on a matter of relevance to inshore and other fishermen. Many people now engaged in the fishing industry do not have a background in fishing. These people come into the industry because they have an interest in it or because a boat owner needs an extra pair of hands. As a result, some people working on boats do not have basic seamanship skills. It is essential that mandatory, basic safety requirements are introduced. This should not take six months or a year as it would not take up a lot of people's time. Three or four days of intensive, basic health and safety instruction is vital. This must also be provided for inshore fishermen. Accidents can happen in shallow waters and calm seas but fishermen will be in the same difficulty if they do not receive basic training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> I wish the Minister well with this legislation. I trust it will achieve what we hope it will achieve, namely, ensure the management and conservation of our salmon stocks which are an important resource. I hope we continue to hold salmon fishing rights well into the next century and that a future Government will update this legislation in a different way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envy any Minister in trying to deal with inland fisheries, particularly the salmon industry. There are so many competing groups, rivalries and jealousies, even with the different sectors, that it is a highly contentious area and the Minister has an unenviable job in trying to oversee this industry.</P>
      <P>I am an advocate of what has become known as the buy-out system in the case of drift net licences. The restrictions placed on these licences in the past four or five years have been such that many fishermen find it difficult to make a living given the short season and the limited amount of netting they are allowed to use. It would be preferable if people were given the option of a buy-out or were allowed fish with a greater length and depth of monofilament net and the season was extended so they would have a chance of making a living.</P>
      <P>There are competing arguments concerning the problems caused by drift net fishermen for draft net fishermen and, in particular, rod fishermen on rivers. In his statement the Minister said his principal national priority is to rod fishermen. Members who represent coastal constituencies and fishing communities would not necessarily share the Minister's view. We have all heard statistics concerning the value to the tourism industry of a salmon caught on a rod. However, many coastal communities have been obliterated in the past 20 years because of restrictions on their activities. There must be a balance in which there are a limited number of licences which operate under proper conditions of length and depth of net and length of season, and a buy-out system for those who wish to leave the industry. These people spend endless days and weeks fishing but cannot make a living because of the restrictions. A buy-out system would be desirable and well received.</P>
      <P>The Minister would receive substantial EU funding for such a scheme. He stated that there are mixed views on the effectiveness of such schemes. However, it makes sense as there is nothing worse than the frustration experienced by fishermen who work for two months without any return to show for it. Many of these fishermen can barely pay for their equipment which has to be renewed every year &ndash; this is in addition to the expense of the licence. This proposal should be explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the objections to a buy-out system? The Blackwater is perhaps the primary salmon fishing river in this country, but in the past year or two a number of licences have been given up and compensation paid. A buy-out <Col N="54" /> system, of which I was unaware, has been in operation. These licences were held by members of the landlord class who paid local crews to fish on their behalf but who kept the benefit of the catch. The Minister may not have experienced this activity. What are the terms of the buy-outs? These deals seem to have been done privately and in secret but I would like to know the terms. This does not only pertain to snap nets, which are primary type nets on rivers, but also to weirs. There were about 23 weirs on the Blackwater at one time but the figure is down to two. Some weirs were bought in recent years and are no longer operative. We are entitled to know what is happening. In asking that, I am trying only to be constructive.</P>
    <P>Drift net fishermen are grossly libelled by a number of speakers in this House from time to time, by newspaper correspondents, people who write letters to the newspapers and some members of the public. Drift net fishermen are traditional fishermen. They have been drift net fishing all their lives. A traditional fisherman fishes, more often than not, from a open 30 foot boat, a half decker. His livelihood is anything but easy. It is difficult work and is very severe in bad weather, which we often get in May and June and used to get in March and April when fishing was in season in those months. Fishermen work extremely hard. That has been the way they, their fathers and their father before them have made a living and most of them did not break the rules, but in the 1970s and 1980s that may have changed considerably, as many more people entered that form of fishing activity and a difficulty arose.</P>
    <P>Fishermen encountered many problems due to unfair treatment by bailiffs or fishery officers. In my part of the country I can recollect 14 people dying in the past 20 years because they went out fishing in small boats in weather conditions that were unsuitable, as it was the only time they felt they were safe from the clutches of the bailiffs. Some of the bailiffs in my part of the country were unscrupulous. There was racketeering involved and I am sure the Minister has heard about it. If not, his predecessors have heard about it. Major racketeering took place, but it did not involve the fishermen. It involved the game keepers, not the poachers. A total of 14 people died because they went out in small boats in foul weather to catch fish on the assumption there would be no bailiffs or fishery officers in the locality, as they would assume the weather conditions were so bad that no one would fish. Four of those 14 men were fishery officers who were forced to go out to sea and who drowned off Ballycotton in most peculiar circumstances. There were two inquiries held into that incident. The first was an internal Department inquiry, known as the Kirwan inquiry, the results of which were not published. The second was a total whitewash in that it was not supposed to arrive at the correct conclusions. It was a disgraceful scenario. If I was related to any of those four decent men <Col N="55" /> who died, I would feel very sore about the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, but that is another day's story. There have been many misrepresentations of events and many drift net fishermen have suffered grievously.</P>
    <P>A total of 40 men from the village of Ardmore in my constituency made a living from fishing 20 years ago, but only two currently make their living from it. Fishermen have been driven off the sea because of activities not within the law carried out by people who should uphold the law. One of the water keepers involved over the years was Michael Hickey from the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. He was severely injured in the course of his duty. He said in court that he did not blame the fishermen who hit him but his superiors who had been blackguarding the fishermen to such a degree they reacted. That man is virtually crippled now. He has been holding a protest outside the fisheries headquarters in Clonmel, County Tipperary, because he was not properly compensated for the injuries and suffering he sustained. It is a terrible black mark against the fisheries board in question and the Department. Such things should not happen. Very few people take into account the trials and tribulations of fishermen who go out to sea in small boats and risk their lives to make a living. As matters have tightened up so much under the new regulations, people should be given an option to buy out or hand up their licences and be compensated for doing that.</P>
    <P>People ask what is the cause of the decline in salmon numbers and they immediately point the finger at drift net fishermen, but there is drift netting and drift netting. The drift netting that has caused the bulk of the damage is drift netting out at sea not by the traditional fishermen but by large trawlers that use three, four, five or six miles of monofilament net. They have been using it for years and their catching potential is dozens of times that of the ordinary licensed inshore fisherman. That is one of the reasons for the depletion of our stocks.</P>
    <P>The other, which should be referred to but is not, is the amount of salmon killed by predators. The Minister referred to them. I refer particularly to seals. There must be an admission and a recognition that seals cause immense damage to salmon stocks around our coasts every year. It is a moot point as to who kills the most salmon off our coasts. Is it the fishermen or the seals? I would say it is the seals. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the fisheries boards should organise culls of seals on a regular basis to ensure that untold damage is not done to our salmon stocks, as is currently the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Animal rights groups scream blue murder once a cull is carried out. There is a need to curtail the number of predators or scavengers, <Col N="56" /> whether on dry land or at sea, in every area. The damage caused by seals is grossly underestimated and is not recognised. People are not standing up to those who object to seal culls.</P>
      <P>The Minister used a wonderful series of words, &ldquo;incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort&rdquo;. It took a civil servant at least half a day to figure out that one. That means a buy out option. I wonder why that could not be stated in plain English. There is a need to make a fair offer to fishermen. Such an offer would probably satisfy many fishermen. It would enable other fishermen to increase their effort and more fish to get up river, thereby making the salmon fishermen and tourist sport fishermen much happier as they would be more likely to catch fish. That being said and all things being equal, by that I mean that the fish survive, we all know that from the end of July until Christmas time in normal years the amount of spawning salmon that go up river and are killed by poachers is huge. It is a moot point as to who causes the most damage, the drift net fishermen, the seals or the up river poachers. I would say up river poachers come top of the list, next the seals and next the drift net fishermen who are licensed to kill the fish and who in most cases act legitimately. We must get our priorities right and put them in order, as we cannot blame all our ills on the people who have been making a living out of this activity all their lives and who can no longer do it because of the restrictions imposed. They are entitled to increase their fishing effort or else to be bought out. Has the Minister asked the European Union if it will provide funding for a buy-out? If so, how much? This has been done in places like Newfoundland, Greenland, Denmark and America. Can the Minister give us examples of where it has been done, the amounts involved and the results? The European Union would back the Minister if we pursued this.</P>
      <P>Drift net fishermen, as has been said, do not have great influence over the management of our salmon stocks. They have always been in a minority on fishery boards and are badly maligned as a result. They do not get fair treatment when the merits of policy are argued as they do not have sufficient voice.</P>
      <P>Is it not true that many restaurants, both here and in Europe, are misleading the public about fish farm salmon? They are selling salmon under the name &ldquo;wild salmon&rdquo; when in fact those are farm salmon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> The Minister is doing a good job, as did two of his predecessors, Deputies Barrett and Gilmore. When Deputy Gilmore was a Minister of State he had particular responsibility for fisheries and in my 27 years in the Oireachtas he was the best equipped person to deal with that sector. He brought about changes, which some fishermen greeted with mixed feelings, but he tried and he was innovative. He deserves credit for that. I do not envy the Minister his job but I expect answers to some of the questions I raised, particularly about the merits of the buy-out system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks by saying that I am not a salmon fisherman either by rod or deep sea but I have the distinction of being born under the fish's star, Pisces in Latin. I know how our salmon fishermen have to work to make a living in the short annual period they get. Every citizen deserves the right to make a living and I would not support any moves to deny any person in the country the right to make a living.</P>
      <P>I know only too well the hardships endured by salmon fishing families from Courtmacsherry to Malin Head on the Cork coast. I know only too well the rigours they endure for their livelihoods. I compliment the Minister on his efforts so far in office. He may not have been born on the shores of Galway Bay or Connemara but he seems to have a human outlook regarding the marine industry. I defy any Member to deter anyone along the coastline from making a living from salmon fishing. I know how these people have tried to eke out a living for decades. They get a licence and go to sea in half deckers or boats with outboard engines. Their water beds are down on top of them and they are subject to every scrutiny but nobody takes their families into consideration, though they wait for the money that will put bread on the table.</P>
      <P>Many Members have never gone through the rigours these fishermen have gone through. If they had they would not be seeking a ban on drift net fishing. Drift net fishing has no effect on wild salmon stocks. The greatest threat to future wild salmon production is not our half deckers or the outboard engine men but the huge fleet of continental trawlers which intercept our salmon stock. When those fish leave the rivers where they are born and bred to go to Greenland to feed, they are trapped, snared and annihilated <i>en route</i> by those continental trawlers. Nobody can tell me that the half decker or outboard engine man is endangering wild salmon. Let us have common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen stocks of salmon come back, year after year, to the Cork, Kerry and Donegal coasts. Those salmon have escaped being trapped by the continental trawlers on the way to the feeding grounds. It is not the local people with drift net salmon licences who are doing the harm. I will not tolerate anybody coming into this House and telling me that the salmon stock off our coasts should be preserved for our rivers and lakes. People who have been making a living for <Col N="58" /> years out of the drift net salmon fishing industry must be protected but their season has been reduced by successive Ministers. I hope the Minister will not fall on that kind of slippery slope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be reduced any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it could be eliminated altogether. I do not want that to happen because a fisherman is a fisherman from the day he is born to the day he dies.</P>
      <P>The greatest threat to our salmon stock is from farmed salmon which may escape from their nets and mate with our free range stock. That would be a serious problem. I ask the Minister to be more vigilant and ensure that every salmon is tagged so that salmon can be traced if they escape from the nets. I have seen that happen in Castletownbere and in the Kenmare River estuary. If that problem is not addressed, it could decimate our wild salmon stock.</P>
      <P>There is no need for widespread pollution of our rivers by agricultural enterprises or industries. Huge grants have been paid to farmers to ensure that effluent will not flow into any river or lake and it is up to the authorities to ensure that does not happen. If a company pours industrial waste into rivers in which our salmon are propagating, its licence should be revoked and it should not be allowed to continue in operation.</P>
      <P>How will the Minister monitor the thousands of salmon which are netted by continental trawlers? There is no way he can do that. I have a great deal of time for my colleague, Deputy Bell, but I would say to him that the greatest predator of all is the continental trawler and our own huge trawlers, which scoop up these salmon when they go out. It is not the old half decker or the man with the outboard engine. Perhaps a different species of salmon is going up to Deputy Bell's constituency than those in mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The half decker fishermen are not responsible for the decimation of the salmon stock.</P>
      <P>Salmon fishermen have a right to make a living. Legitimate drift net salmon fishermen do not break the law. They toe the line, but they are dealing with an industry which is making it almost impossible for them to catch the salmon. If a drift net is floating on top of the ocean, the chances of catching a large number of salmon are very slim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Deasy, when he said there should be some kind of system <Col N="59" /> whereby the drift net salmon fishermen who are operating under a tight schedule, probably four to five weeks, should get an opportunity of making a living. How can he make a living if he is being treated in such a fashion?</P>
    <P>The Minister is a fair-minded man and I know he has the interests of the salmon fishing industry at heart. He would probably know if he was served a wild salmon or a farmed salmon if he went out for dinner. It is easy to know the difference, especially for people who have had an opportunity of discerning them, but the greatest threat will come from the salmon farms. If their boundary nets are breached, and if a large number of salmon escape, the Minister will be in trouble because he will not have the real product &ndash; a wild salmon from the north Atlantic ocean.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy spoke about seals. Seals are a problem. I have seen the frustration of salmon fishermen coming into harbour in the morning after hauling in their nets only to find 40 or 50 heads on the nets, and no salmon. That is the truth as far as the salmon fishing industry is concerned. I am amazed that we cannot cull seals, not in any major way because seals are lovely mammals and they serve their purpose, but they are great predators. They are lazy. They love to have the salmon caught for them. They like to have the salmon trapped and they eat the whole fish off the net, and leave the head.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done as far as the salmon fishing industry is concerned. We have to make sure families who have made their living from salmon fishing for three and four generations can continue to do so. I am a firm believer in the need to maintain our natural resources and ensure that the laws are upheld. For the past two or three years I have not heard of a salmon fisherman violating the regulations on salmon fishing imposed by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>There is a move afoot by certain people to get the Minister and Department to ban the use of drift nets. This net has been in use since Adam was a boy. Our Lord recruited 12 fishermen as his apostles. They cast their nets on the shore and left with him. If the Minister holds his head and uses his judgment I guarantee that drift net fishermen will not decimate the salmon fishery stock and the stock will survive. The only danger posed to the wild salmon fishery stock is when the salmon migrate to the feeding grounds in Greenland and the Faros in Newfoundland for two years before they come back to their native rivers and waters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I grew up in a community where salmon fishing was an important element of people's livelihood. There were two main fisheries in the community &ndash; salmon fishing during the summer and herring fishing during the winter. These fisheries sus<Col N="60" /> tained many of the families in that part of County Donegal. As Deputy Deasy said, fishing was not an easy livelihood at that time. I have seen how salmon fishing has developed and changed over the years. Thirty or 40 years ago salmon fishing was a night-time activity and there was no such thing as daytime drift net fishing. I remember fishermen leaving my village of Bunbeg at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. on 30 and 40 half-decker boats for the fishing grounds and coming back at 5 a.m. 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. the following morning. Many of these boats have engines but the preceding generation only had sails and they had to row their boats out to the fishing grounds. While this was hard work it was worthwhile and it kept at home many people who would otherwise have had to emigrate. These fishermen did not get huge catches but they got the average price. The second major fishery was herring fishing during winter. Fishermen only had to go out into the bay to catch the herring. At Bunbeg, Burtonport and other piers the fish was auctioned for £4, £5 or £6 per cran. This was good money and enough to keep families at home.</P>
    <P>During the 1980s drift net salmon fishing became a daytime activity. This was probably due to the availability of monofilament net. This was a very difficult time as monofilament net was outlawed and it was illegal to use it for salmon fishing. There was continuous harassment between the Navy, the conservation board and fishermen. Deputy Bell referred to the report of the salmon task force, which was established by Paddy O'Toole when he was Minister. One of its recommendations was that a national salmon commission be established. It also recommended that monofilament net should be legalised. The man who grabbed this nettle and made the decision to legalise it was Deputy Gilmore during his term as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. This removed the aggravation from salmon fishing in my area. However, there were definite limitations and restrictions imposed on the use of monofilament net, for example, the length is limited to 1,500 metres and fishermen are only allowed to fish for four days per week.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed fundamental changes in drift net fishing since the 1960s. At one time there were between 30 and 40 half deckers in my village of Bunbeg while last year there were only four. Families on Aranmore Island depended on salmon fishing for their livelihood. Up until the 1980s there were approximately 20 boats on the island while today there are only two or three. One would expect families on Tory Island to depend on fishing for their livelihood but there are only one or two licences on the island. This industry was very important in days gone by but today it is barely surviving.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for this, one of which is the scarcity of wild salmon. Deputy Bell apportioned the blame for this to drift net fishermen, while Deputy Deasy referred to seals, which are a problem. I have met fishermen who have <Col N="61" /> lost half their catch to marauding seals. More effort must be made to deal with poachers and to protect salmon in rivers. The Clady River in my area was one of the important fishing rivers in years gone by. It is now the responsibility of the ESB which could do more to protect it. If it was developed to the stage it was at 30 or 40 years ago it would be a wonderful natural resource. Deputy Sheehan referred to continental trawlers. I do not know if they catch the salmon when they are on their way to Greenland but I have heard that the feeding grounds in Greenland are no longer sacrosanct and that salmon are fished there. There is also a problem with pollution. There are four areas here &ndash; seals, poachers, continental trawlers and pollution. Under the present regime, I do not think drift net fishermen would have to carry a major part of the blame for the scarcity of the wild salmon. It is a very valuable resource and one that needs to be protected for future generations.</P>
    <P>Something has to be done. When buying a salmon the customer should be told whether it is a wild Atlantic salmon or a farmed one. I have nothing against farmed salmon. We have them in Donegal and along the western seaboard. This industry provides important employment for many families who would otherwise be without an income and would probably have to emigrate. Some of the best farms are in my county of Donegal, such as Fanad Sea Fisheries. It produces hundreds if not thousands of tonnes. This industry adds to our export income and provides very valuable employment. Nevertheless, we should be able to differentiate between wild and farmed salmon. Perhaps the Minister and his officials might do something about that because most of us would like to be able to have wild salmon and that is not always what we get.</P>
    <P>A buy out scheme was also mentioned. It is something that should be looked at. There are many fishermen who buy licences every year and it is hardly worthwhile. However, any buy out scheme should be on a voluntary basis, it should not be compulsory. If someone wants to sell his licence or his right to fish, it should be considered. We have it in farming in the form of set aside land and there is no reason we cannot have it as far as salmon fishing is concerned.</P>
    <P>Salmon has been a valuable resource. It has been there for generations and I hope it will be there for future generations. The traditional fishermen I know in my part of the world are conservationists because they know that if their children and future generations are to avail of wild salmon, they have to make sure the species is conserved. I wish the Minister the best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to this most interesting debate. It is great to see such a depth of knowledge on the part of everybody who spoke and to hear the quite varying views of Deputies. There is little doubt but that one of the most remarkable features of Irish <Col N="62" /> life is the wild salmon. It is quite unbelievable that one can see salmon, as I did when I first took over this job, going up 20 foot leaps into the rivers &ndash; for instance, in Newport where we have the National Salmon Research Centre. For more than 50 or 60 years, all of those salmon have been tagged &ndash; by the Guinness family in the old days and by National Salmon Research Centre now &ndash; and recorded. They spawn, come down those rivers, go as far away as Greenland to feed and come back to those rivers to spawn. That is a remarkable story.</P>
      <P>The wild salmon is without doubt the most prestigious food we have as well as being the source of that wonderful sport, salmon angling, which is so lucrative. Our wild salmon stocks have become precariously low. If we do not take action quickly and effectively, we will wipe out the wild salmon stock altogether. The idea behind this legislation is to conserve that wild salmon and grow the stock. In doing so, we want to bring about a balance in terms of the way that salmon is caught.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of the legislation is to try to be more effective in dealing with the illegal catching of wild salmon. I fully agree with the points made by the various speakers, particularly Deputy Connaughton, that there is quite an amount of illegal catching of wild salmon. My first objective is to try to deal more effectively with that. We are all aware that poaching and illegal catching of wild salmon is going on and that is not acceptable. It is my intention to deal with that as effectively as I possibly can. I will make extra resources available to the fisheries boards to employ extra staff, particularly during the spring salmon season. Extra temporary staff will be made available in this coming year to deal with poaching.</P>
      <P>I take the point made that there is far too much poaching going on and that our ability to catch people breaking the law is limited. However, I would argue that there has been a vast improvement in recent years in respect of the efforts of the fisheries boards and I thank the boards and their staff for the very effective work they are doing. However, I take that point and I will invest further resources this year in strengthening the efforts of the boards and the fishery officers.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on everybody, particularly anglers, farmers and those who have an interest in preserving our salmon stocks, to be more vigilant in putting an end to poaching. We must make it clear that illegal catching of wild salmon is a very anti-social behaviour. I would like the message to go out that everybody has a responsibility to stop those greedy people who are involved in poaching wild salmon. No matter how much resources I make available and no matter how great an effort the fisheries boards and officers make, if people are determined to poach and catch salmon illegally, they will do so. If we can make people understand that it is a greedy and unsociable behaviour, that would certainly help.</P>

    <P>The question of tagging was raised by Deputy <Col N="63" /> Connaughton. It is not the intention now or at any time in the future as far as I and my party are concerned to charge for the tags and log books. In any event, any Minister wishing to bring in those charges would have to get the agreement of the Salmon Commission. It would be unlikely that any Minister would attempt to introduce such tagging charges without that agreement. This is not intended as a money collection exercise but as a management tool to provide that very significant information we require to be able to count salmon. Without being able to count salmon and have real information instead of anecdotal information, we will not be able to manage that salmon stock in the way we want.</P>
    <P>We had varying views from Deputy Bell on one end of the spectrum to Deputy Sheehan on the other on the effect of drift netting and the question of a buy out. I have an open mind on how we reduce the commercial fishing but we have to reduce the level of commercial fishing in order to give the stocks a chance to regenerate. I have asked the commission to advise me on this. There is a question of a set aside or a buy out and there are advantages and disadvantages to both propositions.</P>
    <P>To conserve stock, I am determined that we reduce the commercial fishing effort and compensate the commercial fishermen for doing so. I take Deputy Sheehan's point that there are those whose livelihoods depend on salmon. We have to be conscious not to destroy that livelihood and we have to compensate people. There is not a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow as far as my Department is concerned. If there are people out there with licences who expect they will get major prices for a buy out they can take it that will not happen. There are many advantages in the set aside option. People would be compensated for setting aside their drift nets for several years. However, unless there is voluntary agreement on set aside from everybody, it makes no sense. There would be no point in setting aside or buying out some people if others catch the salmon in other ways. I await the advice of the commission and I am happy to act on it and to make resources available to it for either a set aside or a buy-out scheme.</P>
    <P>I recognise the position of the commercial fishermen and the need to catch wild salmon on a commercial basis. The main objective is to ensure conservation and consequently a growth in stock and more salmon up the rivers. That is the whole policy thrust. There is little doubt that the salmon caught by rod is much more valuable to this economy than that caught in the sea or caught by the seal or the poacher. There are those who pay £7,000 and £8,000 per week to go to places such as Argentina, Chile, Iceland and so on to catch wild salmon. That is a significant tourism potential here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the Blackwater. There is a voluntary set aside scheme in the Blackwater which was agreed with the fishery owners. It works on the basis that the holder of <Col N="64" /> the fishery licence is paid the full value of fish which are not being caught based on average catches over previous years. The arrangement is that the Exchequer pays 50% of the cost and the private fishery owners pay the other 50%. It is a good scheme and works well. It enables the salmon population in those rivers to grow. The scheme is operating in two rivers &ndash; the Blackwater and the Laune in County Kerry. I am anxious to expand the scheme. Negotiations are taking place with a number of other draft net fishermen with a view to extending the scheme to other rivers. If it works well in the rivers it will work well in the sea with the drift net fishermen. I am anxious to proceed down that path following the advice of the commission.</P>
    <P>My Canadian counterpart informed me that Canada spent a huge sum in buying out all drift net fishermen five years ago but there is no increase in the salmon going up the river. That is a phenomenon the Canadian Government cannot understand. I am not aware of the practice in other countries but I shall get that information and make it available to the House.</P>
    <P>The sale of farmed salmon, as wild salmon, is illegal. Where that is happening I will attempt to have it stopped. I will take up the matter further following this debate.</P>
    <P>I am beefing up the fishery boards resources. A human resources review is being carried out throughout the boards by consultants. The intention is to respond positively to the review when completed. An extra £2 million is being provided this year for a series of catchment management initiatives such as set aside, pollution control and extra monitoring of illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>I get numerous complaints from fishermen about a growth in the seal population. The House will be aware that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and Islands would have to give permission for the culling of seals. We are in discussion with our Scottish counterparts on that issue and are attempting to carry out some research on the growth in the seal population. We all want to protect the seal and there is no question about it, but if there is a huge growth in population and if there is evidence of serious damage to salmon, that question will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The fishery boards are 100% supportive of the on-the-spot fines. It will give the staff of the boards an additional option in dealing with offenders. The fine is set at £50 but I would have no hesitation in increasing it. I intend to make it a hot season in the spring for poachers. I have already addressed one community which has earned a reputation for poaching wild salmon. I have informed the community if it is not responsible and does not deal with those in the community who have been engaged in this greedy practice the full force of the law will be applied to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to the legitimate interests of the drift net fishermen especially in coastal communities such as west Cork. I am fully <Col N="65" /> aware of the livelihood of fishermen but, as Deputy McGinley said, their livelihood has been severely affected in the past due to the reduction in wild salmon and will be further reduced if action is not taken. The drift net sector is represented on the National Salmon Commission. In 1996 the salmon task force recognised that each sector has to be given esteem. The commercial drift net fishermen on the commission have acted responsibly in regard to the conservation policy.</P>
    <P>The main objective is to increase escapes to the rivers with a view to improving spawning and, thereby increasing the fish stock. A great deal of work is being done by the fishery boards in the development of the spawning rivers by tackling water quality, pollution and providing a much better spawning environment for salmon. The key objective is to increase the number of salmon which get up the rivers to spawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the Ballycotton tragedy. The report by Captain Kirwan was not ever intended to be published. Confidentiality guarantees were given to persons supplying information and there was no right of cross-examination.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with the various points made. It is a question of balance. We have to get the balance right between competing demands. I am satisfied this legislation will considerably enhance our ability to conserve our wild salmon stock and to grow it into the future.</P>

      <P>The objective of this motion is to ensure that timely and effective measures are taken so that Irish and foreign consumers can continue to consume with confidence healthy, quality, nutritious Irish beef, so that farming families all over Ireland can continue to make a living from producing it and so that our processing plants can continue to employ Irish people in processing Irish beef into an ever expanding range of safe, healthy food products. I invite the Government to say tonight that it agrees with these objectives, that it will provide the national resources that are required for timely and effective action and that it will press the European Union authorities to do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union Agriculture Ministers, the heads of state and Government meeting in Nice last week and the beef management commit<Col N="67" /> tee meeting today have only begun to scratch the surface of this problem. I deplore the fact that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development last week refused to answer a question I tabled, asking what proposals they would bring to the EU summit in Nice. I ask the Government now to accept the programme outlined in this motion and to treat the current crisis with the seriousness it deserves.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that, as matters stand at the moment, the Government's ability to deal with the issues before us is seriously compromised by the many unanswered questions concerning the activities of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. The Minister of State has serious questions to answer.</P>
    <P>First, is he the Edmund O'Keeffe who, according to records in the Companies Office, purchased £1.4 million worth of animal feeding stuffs from Ballylough Milling Limited in 1999? Second, if he is that Edmund O'Keeffe, why did he purchase £1.4 million worth of feedstuffs if, as he claims, he has no connection with the running of his family's farming businesses? Third, what were these feedstuffs used for &ndash; were they fed to animals in the O'Keeffe family farm enterprises? Fourth, what kind of feedstuffs were they &ndash; did they contain meat and bonemeal? Fifth, why was payment for these foodstuffs still outstanding to the milling company at the end of the year?</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State is the Edmund O'Keeffe who bought those feedstuffs, he must answer those questions tonight. If his answers are not satisfactory, he should resign. If he does not voluntarily resign, he should be dismissed. If he is the Edmund O'Keeffe who bought the feedstuffs, no conceivable answer that he can give will be satisfactory, since his position demands, for reasons that have been well ventilated in recent days, that he should have no connection whatever with any of the activities of his family farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has tabled an amendment calling for the suspension of the Minister of State. At this point, I do not think that is enough. However, I am disposed to accept the Labour Party amendment in the interests of having a united Opposition front and so that the Government can agree with the motion. The Minister of State in charge of food quality and safety, who is so compromised in all the ways that have recently emerged, is clearly a major obstacle to the kind of action which we now need our Government to undertake to deal with the grave issues that confront us.</P>
    <P>The motion sets out the framework for the action which we believe is required. We must provide for immediate testing of all beef animals entering the food chain. This is so that we can identify, track and eliminate BSE. That testing must begin at the earliest possible moment, must <Col N="68" /> continue for as along as is required and must be carried out as widely as is required.</P>
    <P>I know there are arguments about the relative risk levels of different categories of cattle. It is believed that some categories of animal do not pose any risk. It is said, for example, that no case of BSE has ever been found in the categories of animals normally sold by Irish butchers to our consumers, which I think is true. The fresh beef consumed in this country is typically beef from young heifers, and no case of BSE has ever been found in such an animal. Equally, no case of BSE has ever been found in a steer. Prime Irish beef exported to other member states of the European Union and third countries is typically prime steer beef. It has been said to me, with justification, that the implication that a beef animal aged 32 months is somehow inferior to a beef animal aged 28 months gives consumers an inadequate picture of the facts.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are grounds for all those arguments and that, on the basis of what we know up to now about this affliction, it can be said that they are true and should be taken into account. We must be conscious, however, that we are dealing with a very important public health issue and with consumer perceptions. However much we might like that it were otherwise, education and information take much longer to form opinions than perceptions. That being the case, it is entirely reasonable to test all animals over 30 months of age.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that such testing has been carried out in Ireland in the past. One multiple store in 1996 applied the ENFER test to beef animals that went into the products it sold on its shelves. No disease was found in any of those animals. When the birth cohorts were tested, a small number of cows was detected. However, no beef animal that entered the food chain was found to have posed any risk, and none of the animals that were found to pose a risk had entered the food chain. That testing continued for a year. The enterprise in question, having found no trace of the disease during a year of testing, discontinued the tests.</P>
    <P>My contention, however, is that even if we find that to be the situation, we should keep on testing. That is necessary from a prudential point of view and in restoring consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>If, as I would expect, no indication of the disease is found in prime steer or heifer beef entering the food chain from Irish herds, we should ensure that fact is known. We should also ensure it is known that we are testing comprehensively. In that way we will be able to market prime Irish beef, tested and proven to be BSE free. That is the central, fundamental logic of applying testing at the earliest possible moment as widely as we possibly can and for as long as it seems to be required. It would be an expensive programme, as the Minister said recently on television, but it is one we must undertake as there is no shirking it.</P>
    <P>We must eliminate all animals that may pose a <Col N="69" /> risk. That is the logic of a testing for destruction scheme agreed by the EU Agriculture Ministers. It means we must have comprehensive testing. The testing for destruction scheme has a function in that anybody who has an animal that should enter the food chain must want, and be required, to have it tested. If there are any other animals about which there is doubt the destruction scheme will address that.</P>
    <P>We must have comprehensive testing, but we should be clear that this will entail huge costs. These will take the form of reduced asset values, the reduction of herds and the reduction in overall output. That is where serious income losses to farmers will arise, where throughput and income losses will arise in the processing industry and where social and community problems will begin. No area of the country will be unaffected and in making provision for these schemes, we must recognise that fact. That is why there is an urgent need to define the system of compensation which will deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>The motion identifies the need to secure the best possible valuation for animals for destruction under the EU scheme. I submit that the Minister has enough experience with the difficulties of valuations and enough goodwill in trying to resolve those problems to know what I mean when I say it would be extremely important to have a satisfactory level established for animals that go into the destruction scheme. The motion goes on to call for the immediate institution of a direct income support scheme for affected beef producers in the context of a common EU wide scheme which would aim especially at farmers who are wholly or mainly dependent on beef for their income. This will require the institution of a form of slaughter premium backdated to the emergence of this latest round of the problem. It will be needed to offset the dramatic reductions in income which now face beef producers all over the country.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the dismissive approach of EU Commissioner Fischler, interviewed again on this issue a few days ago, when he says the EU does not have any money. The EU is faced with this problem in the same way as the member states. There must be a co-ordinated common response.</P>
    <P>The compensation scheme will have to be underpinned by an effective EU-wide market intervention measure. Realistically we must expect a substantial reduction in the demand for beef in the EU. We have already seen the closure of certain third country markets. All of that is bound to affect beef sales. We need a substantial intervention measure to ensure that reasonable levels of activity can be maintained in the beef processing industry. It must be available throughout the EU on equitable terms to farmers in all member states. We cannot accept the kind of price differential that has up to now been a deplorable and common feature of EU intervention measures in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>Once we have traced and eliminated the animals that may pose a risk we must dispose of the <Col N="70" /> carcases. That means we must provide for incineration. We can no longer rely on the process we used up to now, that is, rendering and storing these carcases until we can export them to Germany for incineration. Storage is not a method of disposal; it merely postpones the problem.</P>
    <P>Burial is not an acceptable method of disposal. Until recently it was regarded as being a less unacceptable means of dealing with the carcases of suspect animals than transporting them around the country, but too many questions surround it. Nor is it practical to propose a sealed burial for suspect animal carcases along the lines of the systems used in some other countries to bury nuclear waste &ndash; in the hope that it will have been forgotten by the time they pose a problem. That is not an option.</P>
    <P>Since neither storage nor burial is acceptable we must inevitably opt for incineration and we must make provision for it ourselves, even if it is only because the facilities abroad, which currently incinerate our rendered carcases, will themselves have a huge problem to deal with. The argument against the incineration of carcases by environmentalists are theoretical, perfectionist nonsense. We are dealing with a problem we would not ever wish to have. Whether we could have foreseen it is not the issue. It is with us and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Arguments against incineration are in the realm of fantasy; we must deal with the real problem in the real world. That will require a substantial public capital expenditure, a coherent policy to ensure that the right animals are targeted, trapped and destroyed and a clear sighted and determined policy on location. Environmental denial of this would be irresponsible.</P>
    <P>We need as quickly as possible to be in a position where we can certify tested BSE free beef to home and export consumers. We must be able to track beef from the farms to the processors, retailers and the table. That will require the utmost co-operation from all involved in the chain and it will mean effective and transparent administration. It is the only approach which gives us any hope of being able to begin what will be a long and demanding process of restoring consumer confidence and making beef production again a healthy and profitable part of our food production sectors.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is common and concerted action on these problems at EU level. The current problem has been magnified by the failure of other member states to take the kind of action we took in 1996. Irish beef producers are being unfairly penalised for deficiencies on the part of other member states. It is especially galling that one of the member states where the problem has now emerged as a major issue of confidence is France. We all remember the holier than thou attitude the French Administration took to Irish beef even in the wake of the very substantial and difficult measures we introduced in 1996.</P>
    <P>I stress that the action taken must be common <Col N="71" /> and concerted between the EU members states. They must tackle this problem together. Consumers can be protected only by common action. Consumer confidence will be regained only by common standards and farm families can be effectively helped only by common action. It is surely clear by now that non-participation by some other members states in the action taken in 1996 was disastrous.</P>
    <P>I have already said that a differential effect of any intervention measure will not be acceptable in Ireland. Irish farmers who have supported difficult actions, which have been costly to them since 1996, will not now accept any less favourable treatment than that given to farmers in other member states.</P>
    <P>When all these measures are put in place, as they must be, at the earliest possible moment, Bord Bia, with the co-operation of all players in the beef sector, must adopt an energetic and innovative approach to the market promotion of certified and tested BSE free Irish beef. That promotion must be backed by credible measures on farms and in beef processing plants. It must also be backed by Ministers and Ministers of State whose credibility on the issue is beyond any possible question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am pleased to speak on this issue, I am also saddened to do so. We live in an age when we are lucky to have the best food in the world. We have a wide variety of good quality food of which past generations could not dream. We have companies which are developing new food products all the time and leading the way in the world. I have visited some of these companies and I have been highly impressed with their professionalism and the way they do their business. They are conscious of the importance of food safety and of having food of the highest standard. We can be proud of our food processors and of those who manufacture our food and foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind that the consumer is king. The consumer today is discerning and informed. Anything which causes the consumer to be misinformed must be examined. Perception and confidence in food are important. People are conscious of what they eat. They want assurance that what they eat is safe, pure and good for them. The food produced in this country by the farmers and processors is the best in the world. Any adverse publicity or action by anybody which damages that perception will damage our economy. This issue, more than any other, has the potential to do great damage to our wider economy. Deputies, Senators and MEPs from both the Government and Opposition must do their utmost to ensure this issue is dealt with as quickly and economically as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure our reputation abroad is guaranteed and that the food we export is seen to be safe and of the highest quality. We know it is safe but it is not good enough for us to say it is <Col N="72" /> safe; we must prove it scientifically. That is why we must test every animal which enters the food chain. I read today in the newspapers that ENFER is ready to test and it is waiting for the Department to give it the go ahead to do so. I call on the Minister to ensure this testing procedure is carried out as quickly as possible. He must also ensure that anything which damages the reputation of Irish food at home and abroad is dealt with, regardless of how painful it is. The cost of not doing so is too great.</P>
    <P>We talk about tracing our food from the farm to the fork. Farmers have invested heavily in their farms to comply with pollution and hygiene regulations, animal welfare criteria, the traceability system and so on. It is difficult for farmers to get up in the morning to feed their cattle and then to find they will not get a return for them. It is not the farmers' fault.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify what type of premium will be paid to farmers when their animals are slaughtered. How much will they get? Is it true that the French will get payments at pre-BSE prices? Is there any truth in the reports that Irish farmers may get prices based on last month's returns? Will the Minister consider paying a special assistance grant on the slaughter documents, regardless of who slaughters the cattle? That was suggested to me as one way of helping farmers in this situation.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Europe? We have put our tests in place so we can guarantee that the beef we produce is safe. Perhaps the Minister can tell us why the Europeans have let everyone down.</P>
    <P>What is the up-to-date position in terms of our markets in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere? I remember asking the Minister recently why he did not visit our largest market when this problem arose to head it off at the pass. He said he was possibly badly advised that it would be wrong to go at that time. The Minister should have gone out at the beginning. Perhaps he could tell the House about his recent trip to Egypt. How did he get on there and what further action does he intend to take to ensure that market is reopened to us? </P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister, who is a colleague in my constituency, on having to deal with such an enormous problem. However, I am not sure he had the same sympathy for Deputy Yates who was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry when this disease broke out. There were few people on this side of the House at that time who supported Deputy Yates. He was blamed for a reduction in cattle prices and for the disinterest in Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember receiving a pamphlet in south-west Cork during the last general election, which was signed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which stated that Deputy Walsh would soon restore the status of Irish beef on the inter<Col N="73" /> national market. I give the man credit for doing his best.</P>

      <P>However, he has not lived up to the message he gave to my constituents during the last election. The Minister faces the predicament today that Deputy Yates faced four years ago. The Minister should not have to carry the can for this debacle. His predecessor, Deputy O'Kennedy, imposed a complete ban on the use of meat and bonemeal but it was not fully implemented, which was the kernel of the problem. I give credit to the former Minister for seeking a complete ban on all meat and bonemeal products. However, an escape hatch was found and this ban was not implemented. Some people in the Minister's Department introduced a back door measure to feed this product to ruminants as well as poultry and pigs, which also enter the food chain. Feeding meat and bonemeal to poultry and pigs is the same as feeding it to ruminants.</P>
      <P>I said in this House two weeks ago that there should be a complete ban on the use of meat and bonemeal. This happened three days afterwards. However, I am not happy about the statement from Europe that this ban will apply for just six months. How can we get rid of the BSE disease in Europe if meat and bonemeal is banned for just six months? EU Ministers for Agriculture are codding themselves. The Minister must insist that meat and bonemeal is banned forever. I admire his efforts to obtain a disease free beef product but he must act quickly to impose the regulation. I have been informed that meat and bonemeal is still being used. I do not know if this is correct, therefore, I ask the Minister to deny this if he can. The Minister must take the bull by the horns and approach this matter in a genuine way. He has the ability, courage and determination to do so. I admire the swiftness of his actions in ensuring the immediate testing of all animals over 30 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke in this House two weeks ago I urged the Minister to give special incentives to farmers who produce baby beef. Half or three-quarter tonne bullocks or carcases are no longer needed. What is needed to bring Irish beef to the required standard is the production of baby beef. Did the Minister for Finance do anything in the budget to promote that? I gave timely notice of this requirement ten days before the budget was introduced and nothing was done about it. Farmers who produce baby beef and make sure that the product which is being exported all over the world will be disease free were not given any incentive. The Minister, who has great principles and for whom I have great admiration, should cut out the red tape. He cannot sit idly by in his armchair and let Irish farmers be held to ransom by European farmers who fed meat and bonemeal <Col N="74" /> to their ruminants while he introduced a blanket ban which, in the event, was not imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister who will soon have to build an incineration plant will have to face up to the facts. He must tackle this problem. He cannot shy away from it. He may wish to locate an incineration plant in the midlands or in his own constituency of south-west Cork, but I doubt it. I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to deal with these carcases in the future. He cannot put them into cold storage. They will have to be dumped somewhere. Perhaps he intends dumping the carcases at sea. The carcases will have to be disposed of one way or another. The Minister should address this problem. We will not be able to convince Egypt, Saudi Arabia or other countries to which we export beef that we have a disease free product until he ensures the beef we export is baby beef, up to two and a half years old.</P>
    <P>Other EU member states have a happy go lucky policy which has dragged the Minister into this net. He should not be misled by these countries. We have the finest quality beef in the world. However, this will be of no benefit unless we can convince the countries to whom we export beef that we have a product which will stand up to any type of scrutiny.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, who will deal with relevant issues relating to his position. I move amendment No. 1 and confirm that I am not prepared to accept amendment 1 to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&ldquo;recognising the need to protect public health and reinforce consumer confidence;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the new and greater difficulties for Irish farmers resulting from the detection of BSE in Continental EU member states;</P>
      <P>&ndash;wishing to counter the serious consequences which this could have for farm families, workers in the food processing industry and the fabric of rural society and communities;</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting the recent decisions at EU level in particular in regard to testing, animal feed and the purchase of cattle for destruction;</P>
      <P>&ndash;and noting the statement and clarification by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe; supports the Government's actions:</P>
      <P>&ndash;to safeguard the integrity and safety of Irish beef by implementing stringent controls to protect consumer health and to eradicate BSE from the cattle population,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" />&ndash;to implement the further decisions that have been taken recently at EU level,</P>
    <P>&ndash;to encourage the implementation of appropriate arrangements in association with the industry to deal with animal waste and other material from the livestock sector,</P>
    <P>&ndash;to pursue the provision of appropriate EU market and support arrangements to assist livestock producers affected by the market situation,</P>
    <P>&ndash;to ensure that all the relevant agencies continue to adopt an energetic and innovative approach to the promotion of Irish beef and cattle, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;to keep the matter under review in the light of scientific developments.&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>I move the amendment in the context of seeking to secure the agreement of all sides to the issues involved and, in particular, on the actions that require to be taken to deal comprehensively with BSE and to further protect public health. We also need measures, at least in the short-term, to deal with the adverse effects on the market and to assist producers whose incomes are affected. I am confident that the House will support the amended and composite motion when it has fully considered the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for tabling the motion and I also thank Deputy Sheehan for the neighbourly and helpful advice he offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a comprehensive and constructive debate on 28 and 29 November on BSE and related issues. There have been a number of significant developments at EU level since then and I welcome this further debate. I look forward to further constructive contributions on this important issue, about which we all have legitimate and genuine concerns. These concerns have been heightened by recent events in Europe, where a number of issues have seriously affected consumer confidence in these and other countries and have resulted in market access difficulties to third countries. The debate gives me the opportunity to outline the measures being taken here and at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate two weeks ago, I gave data showing that the overall incidence of BSE in Ireland continues to be extremely low and pointed out that it represents 0.0012% of our total cattle population. I also pointed out that the higher number of cases here this year was foreseen in the recent report of the European Union's scientific steering committee. This predicted a temporary increase in numbers for the next couple of years from animals infected prior to the measures introduced in 1996 and 1997. That committee also concluded that the Irish system was &ldquo;optimally <Col N="76" /> stable&rdquo; from 1998, meaning that the measures in place since then prevent the prion agent of BSE from re-infecting cattle.</P>
    <P>From the earliest stages, we have had an extensive range of surveillance and control measures to deal with BSE and these were significantly revamped in 1996 and 1997 in the aftermath of the announcement of the possible link between BSE and the new variant CJD. In my opinion the Irish control and eradication system, which I outlined in detail on the last occasion, is among the most comprehensive in the world. We have updated our controls on an ongoing basis and will continue to do so as more information and scientific knowledge become available.</P>
    <P>The recent unilateral actions by some countries are symptomatic of the tremendous political pressure being brought to bear on member states to introduce measures, which they see as necessary, to re-assure their consumers, notwithstanding that no new information or scientific developments as regards BSE or CJD has emerged.</P>
    <P>It was critical, in light of these events, that the Council of Ministers should move quickly to re-establish a Community approach to dealing with BSE by adopting a series of supplementary measures to help restore consumer confidence in beef. We have consistently stated that we believe the correct way to proceed is to adopt an EU-wide, science-based approach. This is preferable to and certainly more effective than sporadic, unco-ordinated, unilateral actions by individual countries on, at best, dubious scientific grounds.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the Council met for 17 hours on 20 and 21 November following which it issued a statement emphasising the wide range of measures already in place to control BSE and noted the importance of effective implementation of these measures. It reconvened on 4 December to consider further Commission proposals relating to extending the ban on meat and bonemeal, testing requirements for cattle over 30 months of age, the introduction of a purchase for destruction scheme, market measures and other aspects.</P>
    <P>At that meeting, and following prolonged and intense negotiations, the Council reached a series of conclusions relating to protecting public health, restoring consumer confidence in beef and providing for the introduction of support for the beef market. The conclusions covered a wide range of issues among which were: the extension of the current ban on the use of meat and bone-meal from 1 January next for a temporary period of six months; agreement to the Commission decision for a rapid BSE detection test for cattle over 30 months and the need for EU financing for tests; animals over 30 months can go to the food chain only if tested; the Council noted the proposal for a &ldquo;purchases for destruction&rdquo; scheme for livestock over 30 months in order to provide an alternative outlet for such animals &ndash; the compensation payable for such animals would take account of the different types of animals and markets and the measure will attract 70% financing from the Union; and agreement on a frame<Col N="77" /> work for the lifting of national measures by certain member states.</P>
    <P>The Council also decided that it is essential to introduce intervention, the details of which would be decided at the beef management committee. At my insistence the Council also accepted that beef producers are likely to be adversely affected by the market situation and called on the Commission to report on the situation and to make proposals to the Council which undertook to act on these as a matter of urgency. Finally, the Council called on the Commission to examine the question of alternative proteins for farm animals and to bring forward any appropriate proposals.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the divergence of views among Ministers, it was essential that this particular Council reached a successful conclusion and that the full range of issues which had arisen were adequately addressed. In my view the agreement provides an improved framework for protecting human and animal health and restoring consumer confidence. It also provided the basis for addressing market aspects and for assisting producers. We now need to finalise the outstanding aspects of the arrangements at EU level and to proceed with implementation of what was agreed.</P>
    <P>I have previously outlined in some detail the position as regards meat and bonemeal ban. In particular, we have had a comprehensive range of controls in place to ensure that cattle/sheep in Ireland could not have access to feeds containing meat and bonemeal. All other member states did not have such controls to eliminate the possibility of cross-contamination of ruminant feeds in feed mills.</P>
    <P>Neither the EU scientific committee nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's BSE sub-committee has recommended a ban on scientific grounds on the use of meat and bonemeal for non-ruminant feed. However, and in view of the enforcement difficulties in many other member states and the central role played by the product in the wider BSE issue, the Commission proposed and the Council has now accepted an EU wide ban on meat and bonemeal in all farm animal feed for six months. The decision taken by the Council in that regard was not unanimous and at least two members states did not support it.</P>
    <P>I supported this proposal at the Council, notwithstanding that it was not warranted on scientific grounds in our circumstances and the difficulties that will arise in implementing it here. For example, some 150,000 tonnes of commercial meat and bonemeal are produced here each year. In the short-term, animal waste will have to be processed and stored at a significant cost and the policy represents a major potential risk to the environment.</P>
    <P>I have previously indicated that it is essential that we put in place arrangements for ultimately disposing in Ireland of all BSE material and other animal wastes. In effect, this means incineration or thermal treatment facilities of some sort. Without such facilities, we will very soon be facing environmental and waste management problems <Col N="78" /> of an unprecedented scale. Ireland is the only country in Europe without such facilities for this purpose. I was heartened by this evening's contributions, those from all parties in the Dáil on 28 and 29 November and in the Seanad last week in respect of this matter. I hope this consensus will continue to apply and percolate down to local level in order that members of all parties will come to realise that we cannot expect other member states to deal with our problems for us.</P>
    <P>The recent decision at EU level provides that cattle over 30 months cannot enter the food chain unless they pass one of the EU validated rapid tests. There is no legal requirement to test cattle which are under 30 months of age. I am proceeding with arrangements for the testing of cattle over 30 months from early January next and we are finalising the operational and logistical issues involved. Three companies are capable of carrying out these tests which are somewhat difficult, given that they involve a post mortem examination. We must deal with the logistics before we increase the level of testing. However, we should be in a position to do so in the new year.</P>
    <P>As regards numbers, approximately 750,000 cattle over 30 months of age are processed each year. Data from the CMMS shows that to date this year, more than 1.1 million cattle or about 60% of the total national herd are over 30 months of age. Given the slaughtering pattern, I am confident that there will be sufficient capacity to deal with testing at the level required from early January. The youngest ever confirmed case of BSE in Ireland involved a cow of 45 months of age. Accordingly, the use of the test on animals under 30 months of age is not an immediate priority, given the volume of tests to be arranged and the limited capacity initially available.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the decisions taken today at the beef management meeting. The &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme was finalised this evening. This measure is seen by the Commission primarily as a market managing tool, as is evidenced by the fact that it is being introduced under Article 38 of the basic beef regulation. The Commission hopes to attract up to 500,000 tonnes of beef into the scheme across Europe over the next year and, thereby, help to offset the reduction in beef consumption in some of the other member states. This measure is, therefore, significantly different from the over 30 months scheme which was introduced in the UK in 1996 as a public health measure because under the regulation, the price will be based on the average market price in each member state for individual categories over a four week period. Thus the price available under the destruction scheme in each member state will be somewhat higher than the current market prices and this will ensure the scheme will be attractive across the EU, giving producers an incentive to sell cattle into the scheme. If the scheme is not attractive it will not be used and the EU wishes to make sure it is attractive to all the member states. It is of major importance that the scheme is equally attractive <Col N="79" /> to all producers in the EU because market balance next year will be crucially dependent on the number of cattle sold under the scheme.</P>
    <P>While I am not enamoured of the scheme and would prefer better targeting of cattle being slaughtered, I accept that this type of measure is unavoidable in present circumstances. Given that the measure is primarily market driven, we had sought a destruction price at a higher level than that adopted by the beef management committee today. However, given the lack of preparedness of most member states to commence testing early in the new year, it is likely that a significant number of cattle will be sold into the scheme. Clearly, this will open new market opportunities for Irish beef, particularly from cattle under 30 months &ndash; the baby beef Deputy Sheehan talked about &ndash; so we need to be in a position to supply this market.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for intervention were also agreed this afternoon by the beef management committee. At my request flexibility was introduced into the arrangements for intervention. These arrangements will apply immediately following agreement at today's beef management committee meeting. The measures include changes to the type and weight of eligible animals and will be helpful in restoring stability to the uncertain market conditions currently prevailing.</P>
    <P>The changes provide for an increase in the eligible weight of carcases going into intervention from the current level of 340 kg to 430 kg for the forthcoming two tenders. Thereafter, this will reduce to 380 kg. Crucially, cattle grading as 04 will be eligible for intervention under the new arrangements. The processing margin is also being increased from the current level of 10 to 14 per 100 kg. This is the equivalent of 5p per lb. The new arrangements apply immediately and the deadline for offers has been fixed for 19 December with adjudication following on 22 December. These changes to the intervention rules particularly suit Ireland in that they provide support for the majority of Irish cattle in terms of both grade and weight.</P>
    <P>I have at all times been particularly concerned to ensure that adequate market support is available to Irish producers and the combination of these two measures &ndash; the purchase for destruction scheme and the more flexible intervention arrangements &ndash; should provide effective market support for the Irish beef industry in the difficult months ahead. The Commission has already increased export refunds and introduced a private storage aid scheme for cows in order to provide additional support to the market. The export refund changes, for example, are worth 5p per lb in the case of male beef and 9p per lb in the case of female beef, and should significantly improve the competitiveness of our exports on third country markets. The private storage scheme was introduced from 27 November and will run until 2 February 2001.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia has been doing a superb promotional job and has been supported by our embassies in <Col N="80" /> all the areas of the world where we do business. Deputy Stanton asked about the Egyptian situation. Senior officials of the Department and I have travelled to Egypt where I had a positive meeting with Dr. Wali, the Minister for Agriculture. He pointed out that there had been adverse publicity surrounding the BSE problem in Europe, a decision was taken against the EU and we were caught up in that. Despite the fact that this afternoon's news from Egypt is disappointing I am convinced that we will have the licences restored soon.</P>
    <P>Farmers have lost out in the recent problems. I made a point of drawing this matter to the attention of the Council of Ministers at its recent meeting. The matter was also raised by the Taoiseach at the summit meeting at the weekend and he succeeded in substantially strengthening the Council's declaration. I am particularly pleased, therefore, that the Council has asked the Commission to examine the impact of the current market difficulties on the income of beef producers and to report back on the situation with appropriate proposals. The council has undertaken to act on any such proposals as a matter of urgency. I have also discussed the position during the past four weeks and as recently as yesterday with Commissioners Fischler and Byrne.</P>
    <P>The advance payment has been increased from 60% to 80% . With modern technology and with the commitment of officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who will work over weekends, we hope to make these payments before Christmas.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe): Nothing in my record of actions as Minister of State or in relation to my compliance with law, be it the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Companies Act or the Taxes Consolidation Act, will be construed by any fair minded, reasonable person as an abuse of office, an attempt to gain from secrecy, fraud, negligence, recklessness or malicious or corrupt intent. I have not opened offshore accounts. I have not hidden behind the veil of incorporation or buried my business in foreign jurisdictions. I have not evaded tax and I did not use the tax amnesty. I have not sought favours nor abused in any way the powers vested in me. I have been open at all times about my interests.</P>
    <P>It has not ever been a secret to Deputies and to the farming community that my family and I are farmers, and pig farmers in particular. They knew this long before the Ethics in Public Office Act came into force and they knew it at every moment I have spoken about agriculture in the House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputies are mistaken if they believe the politics of the witch hunt can only work in one direction. Those who live by the sword die by it. I have not ever liked the politics of the witch hunt &ndash; heads in basket politics &ndash; and I know that view is shared by most Deputies. It is my turn now to be the subject of such politics. I take it as it comes but I do not believe this type of politics dignifies this House or wins much admiration or respect from the people.</P>
    <P>I have, at all times, endeavoured to live up to the highest standards expected in public office to which all of us aspire and which we are now expected to achieve. I am giving my full co-operation to the Public Offices Commission. I have engaged lawyers out of my own pocket and I have instructed them to communicate on my behalf with the commission. If, following the conclusion of an investigation by the POC, violations are proved I will, at that time, accept my responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I am writing to the Taoiseach, in the spirit of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Cabinet handbook, to inform him of the interests of my spouse and my children, who are adults, even where no connection to my public duties has been, is or can be established.</P>
    <P>I have instructed my solicitors to put into a blind trust all my shareholdings, all of which were set out in my declaration to the Public Offices Commission. I resigned all directorships when I became a Minister. I remained on a committee of a co-operative, Dairygold, which is not a plc. The committee had limited functions and I am now resigning from that committee also.</P>
    <P>There is no reason the names of licensees should remain confidential. The licences no longer have a commercial value and the following are the names of the licensees: Ballysallagh Feeds Ltd, Ballysallagh, Kinsalebeg, County Waterford; Blackwater Feeds Ltd, Ballinaroone, Ballyduff, <Col N="82" /> County Waterford; Matthewstown Milling Ltd, c/o Grenan Pig Farm, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford; Matthewstown Milling Ltd, Hilltop Pig Farm, Fenor County Waterford; Matthewstown Milling Ltd, Lower Pig Unit, County Waterford; Matthewstown Milling Ltd, Pig Fattening Unit, Fenor, County Waterford; Sladeville Ltd, Retagh, Carrick-on-Suir, County Waterford; Thomas Leahy, Birchgrove Farms, Johnstown, Castlebridge, County Wexford; Joseph Healy, Knoxtown, Clonroache, Enniscorthy, County Wexford; Ronan Farms, Rosegreen, Cashel, County Tipperary; Tara By-Products, Rosegreen, Cashel, County Tipperary; Ballylough Milling Ltd, Ballylough, Mitchelstown, County Cork; Ronan Farms, Ballyhooly, County Cork; Ronan Farms, Ballyhooley, County Cork; Ronan Farms, Glenasack, Glencullen, County Cork; Denis O'Riordan, West View Pig Farm, Coachford, County Cork; Mangle Milling Ltd, Annakiska, Doneraile, County Cork; Killicane Feeds Ltd, Mitchelstown, County Cork.</P>
    <P>My family's farm fully complies with all health and food safety standards and intends to apply immediately for the quality assurance scheme and will take steps, if any, that may be necessary to comply with the enhanced quality assurance schemes which will come in the future.</P>
    <P>Having been an active farmer, I honestly did not consider this minimal activity in relation to a family farm as being actively involved in its management. Every farmer in the country, and even some journalists, know that there is a lot more to active management of farming than signing cheques or being a debtor. They also know that, on a farm, it is much harder to separate the personal from the business, unlike a trading company but perhaps like a family pub or legal practice with which many Deputies will be familiar. Our farm was run like family businesses up and down the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with suggestions that the granting of licences to Ballylough Milling in respect of the purchase and incorporation into non-ruminant feed of meat and bonemeal, MBM, was in some way untoward. Deputies who have taken time to scrutinise the most recent register of Members' interests will acknowledge that I declared my shareholding in Ballylough Milling. I am a shareholder in the company but I am not a director. I have also clarified that the enterprise is operated by my son and that I have not been involved in day-to-day operations, although, as I said earlier, I have signed company cheques from time to time. My son, Pat, is the best known man in the country at this stage.</P>
    <P>Ballylough Milling is the entity which carries out the milling and mixing of pig feed on the premises of the pig enterprise owned by my family. Over the years meat and bonemeal was incorporated into the feed, as was routine throughout the industry. Despite claims in the media, we do not mill it and have never done so. Our mill is purely to crush corn and mix, nothing more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> The incorporation of MBM into ruminant feed was banned in 1990. However, its incorporation into non-ruminant feed, that is for pigs and poultry, was allowed, subject to strict conditions which were further strengthened in 1996. These conditions included the requirement to hold a licence and were designed to ensure that feed containing MBM, which had been prepared for non-ruminants, did not enter the ruminant feed chain.</P>
    <P>At the time, feeding meat and bonemeal was not considered an underhand, nefarious or even dangerous practice &ndash; something to be done in shame and to be hidden from the public. Since the State stipulated that farms could apply for and be granted licences to feed meat and bonemeal to pigs, this amounted to an endorsement at the time of the acceptability, within limits, of food health and safety of the practice. The situation has changed, and I accept that change. It applies to feed for all animals. I welcome anything that enhances consumer confidence in meat products.</P>
    <P>Our farm went a route which was sanctioned by the State. If I am guilty of not ensuring that my family farm did not meet what was considered best practice &ndash; which would have required my very active involvement in the farm &ndash; then, equally, the State itself is guilty of not requiring best practice by law. We have debated such matters over the years in the House and not just in relation to meat and bonemeal. It is fair to say that the State does not take the view of perfection or nothing in relation to standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <P>There are acceptable limits and a range within these limits. This has been seen to be the most practical way to go in the absence of perfect information and risk assessment in many areas. My family's farm operated within the then range of acceptable limits, and I do not believe that I or members of my family should face a hanging offence for doing so.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that up to last week's ban, Denmark and Holland, two of Europe's biggest pig producers, routinely fed meat and bonemeal. It was also fed to hens in Holland which is one of the world's largest producers of eggs and exports 8.5 billion eggs.</P>
      <P>My family and I have not breached any standards in relation to food safety or quality assurance. Unfounded claims have been made in the media. This controversy grew on a claim by a Sunday newspaper that our farm had signed up to a quality assurance scheme for which we are not eligible. In the original story that started a dirty-tricks affair, there were four errors in the first 400 words &ndash; almost a mistake per paragraph. Even though false allegations have been made about me and the papers know they are false&mdash;</P>

Once the licensing requirements were introduced, it became necessary for Ballylough Milling to apply to the Department for the necessary licences. It was open to any other company which wished to purchase and use MBM to similarly apply to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that it will be clearly apparent that the processing of the company's application followed standard procedure and was free of any untoward influences, I wish to put on the record of the <Col N="85" /> House the relevant details. On 6 November 1996, Ballylough Milling lodged its application with the Department. On 26 November 1996, following inspection of the premises by a Department inspector, that inspector recommended to his superiors refusal of the application on grounds of concerns relating to cross-contamination of ruminant feed. On 22 January 1997, an assistant principal officer in the Department wrote to my son, Pat O'Keeffe, who is a director of the company, refusing the application but advising him, as is standard procedure, of the right to make representations within 14 days. On or about 2 February 1997, my son, Pat O'Keeffe, on behalf of the company, wrote to the Department appealing the decision.</P>

      <P>Between 2 February 1997 and 27 May 1997, departmental personnel at head office level and in the district veterinary office were involved in consideration of the appeal and in formulating recommendations. It should be noted that other cases were also being considered by the Department at this time &ndash; Ballylough Milling was not the only such case.</P>
      <P>On 27 May 1997, a senior superintending veterinary inspector made recommendations in three cases, including that of Ballylough Milling, to a deputy chief veterinary officer. Between 12 June and 17 June 1997, the deputy chief veterinary officer in question indicated that he was agreeable to granting Ballylough Milling the licences it had sought, subject to certain conditions. It should be noted that this decision in principle was taken during the term of office of the previous Government. On 23 July 1997, this decision was endorsed at assistant secretary level. On 23 July 1997, a letter was issued by the Department conveying this decision.</P>
      <P>Between 23 July 1997 and 19 September 1997, Ballylough Milling submitted to the Department various items of documentation in the context of satisfying the Department on meeting the conditions on which the licences would be issued. Finally, on 19 September 1997, two licences to purchase and to incorporate MBM were granted by the Department to Ballylough Milling Limited. The conditions under which these licences were granted to Ballylough Milling were similar to those applying to other licences and were exclusively motivated by preventing cross-contamination of pig and ruminant feed. There was no policy on the part of the Department to limit the number of licences granted, but such licences were granted only to those applicants who were able to satisfy the Department they could meet the conditions designed to ensure there would be no cross-contamination. The critical issue was to ensure that meat and bonemeal did not enter ruminant feed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To any fair-minded observer this demonstrates definitively that the matter was dealt with in an entirely proper fashion, that it was at all times <Col N="86" /> dealt with at official level and that I had no hand, act or part in any of the decisions relating to the granting of licences to the company.</P>
    <P>Licences of this kind were granted for a period not exceeding 12 months. Accordingly, Ballylough Milling has had to apply for licences on a number of occasions since the events I have detailed. It has done so successfully, undergoing the inspections which are a normal part of such processes. The most recently issued licence expired on 24 November last. An application for new licences was submitted to the Department but, in light of decisions taken at the recent EU Council of Agriculture Ministers' meeting, the Department is now to implement a ban on the feeding of MBM to all farm animals and licences will not, therefore, be granted. In common with other enterprises which, entirely legitimately and in accordance with their licences, have been purchasing and using MBM for non-ruminant feeds, Ballylough Milling will now have to cease using MBM and move to alternative sources of protein for animal feed.</P>
    <P>I now wish to explain the situation regarding the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme. The Bord Bia pigmeat quality assurance scheme is a voluntary initiative set up in 1989 and is designed to support the marketing and promotion of Irish pigmeat. Since January 1998, the operation of the scheme specifically requires that MBM is not fed to pigs being processed under the scheme. A six-month transition period was allowed for the necessary arrangements to be put in place at farm level.</P>
    <P>The pig farm owned by my family was inspected for potential participation in the quality assurance scheme on 5 May 1998 and the use of MBM, in accordance with licence, was noted by the independent farm inspector. Accordingly, the farm was precluded by Galtee Meats from supplying pigmeat under the quality assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia has confirmed it carried out a detailed on-site review at the Galtee plant. This review has revealed no evidence that pigs from the farm owned by my family have been processed under the quality assurance scheme. Compliance with the provisions of the scheme is enforced by regular audits undertaken by independent approved auditors and I understand that Galtee Meats has consistently met the requirements of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Plants that are members of the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme may source pigs that have been fed meat and bonemeal but must have in place a traceability system which ensures that those pigs are segregated and are not processed under the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme. The facts are that pigs from my family's farm are not now, and have not been, accepted into the Bord Bia scheme operating in Galtee.</P>
    <P>I would now like to clarify the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with regard to requests under the Freedom of Information Act related to the use <Col N="87" /> of MBM. In June and July 1999, the Department processed three requests under the Act seeking access to certain information, including a list of all persons or companies licensed by the Department to purchase and/or use mammalian MBM. Having examined the requests, the Department was of the opinion that, while the records contained commercially sensitive information, it was in the public interest to release the information. As required under the Act, the Department notified the licence holders that it intended to release the information and advised them, as is required, of their right to appeal this decision to the Office of the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>A number of parties, including Ballylough Milling, objected to the release of information. Three of them, including Ballylough Milling, lodged appeals &ndash; as is their right &ndash; with the Information Commissioner in September 1999. Under the provisions of the Act, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is unable to release the records concerned pending the outcome of these appeals. The first occasion on which I became aware that objections/appeals had been made in this matter was as result of recent media coverage. I also want to make it clear that I played no part in decisions relating to the release or otherwise of any of the information which had been requested. As I said earlier, I also do not agree that this information should be withheld further and I have gone on the record of the Dáil earlier this evening.</P>

      <P>The quality of Irish food was always known to be of an excellent standard and, as Minister of State, I was concerned the existing assurance schemes lacked the independent accreditation structures that would give it international credibility.</P>
      <P>The expert group I established has produced clear-cut and definitive mechanisms for achieving the assurance that Irish food deserves. Its report will be available to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development shortly. All sectors of the industry were represented on this group from primary producers to processors and retailers and the State agencies.</P>
      <P>Food quality and food safety have separate structures in the system. However, this expert group has determined that any food quality scheme must incorporate food safety components, even though the remit for safety lies with another Department. I welcome this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group is chaired by Professor Joe Buckley of University College Cork and also includes representatives of consumers, the industry and farming groups. I understand the group has completed <Col N="88" /> its deliberations and is expected to present its report shortly.</P>
    <P>Last week it was suggested in a debate in the Seanad that I was blocking the publication of a report, which, as will now be apparent, I have yet to receive. I trust the foregoing will dispose of that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House I have, at all times, carefully and conscientiously discharged my responsibilities as Minister of State with responsibility for food. The first and central allegation made against me was that my farm was a participant in the quality assurance scheme. That allegation was false, as has been confirmed by Bord Bia and Galtee. The claims then moved on to a possible conflict of interest. I had no hand, act or part in the application by Ballylough Milling for a licence, which was above board and fully legal.</P>
    <P>Attitudes to the use of meat and bonemeal have changed dramatically in recent weeks. The main focus has always been preventing the feeding of this product to cattle and sheep. The Council of Ministers last week imposed a total ban on a temporary basis and acknowledged it was being done for control reasons and not for scientific reasons. The position of Ballylough Milling, notwithstanding the freedom of information position, was known in farming circles. Given the way events have moved, I acknowledge it would have been better if Ballylough Milling did not avail of its legal right to have a licence. Therefore, no conflict, perceived or otherwise, could have arisen. In any event, this practice has ended. I have already indicated that I have no involvement in the day to day running of the farm and I equally accept it would have been better if this situation had been totally clear. I have been involved in agriculture all my life and I am a passionate believer in the development of the food industry and in the role of high standards and good quality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was well aware that I was a member of the IFA when he was an economist and we had many meetings in the Metropole Hotel in Cork. I hope he enjoys the drinks at the Fine Gael reception tonight and I wish him well.</P>

      <P>I welcome much of what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development told us this evening in terms of upgrading the safeguards and measures to deal with BSE. Identification of the emergence of BSE was never going to be easy for a number of reasons. It has a long incubation period. It tends to strike down a single animal in a herd and this is still the pattern. It produces clinical signs that resemble other conditions and can only be identified after the animal is slaughtered. While criticisms of the system are many, it should be remembered there <Col N="89" /> were specific problems associated with BSE that had not been previously encountered.</P>
      <P>The debate on BSE has moved on from the need for a ban on meat and bonemeal for pig feed. This has been overtaken by the decision by the Council of Ministers to impose a six months ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to any farm animals in Europe, commencing in January. This in itself raises other questions in relation to the use of the pigs that are currently being fed meat and bonemeal. What happens to the product? What happens to the meat and bonemeal currently held by the licence holders? What will happen to the meat and bonemeal over the next six months? What longer term plans are being considered for the disposal of the meat and bonemeal should the ban remain in place? The time to discuss and address this is now and not in six months' time when another crisis will be on our hands, if there is no contingency plan in place. Two weeks ago I called for a complete ban on meat and bonemeal, and I reiterate that this evening.</P>
      <P>When the subject was debated in the House two weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, spoke about the need for integrated systems of quality assurance, specifically noting that the quality assurance systems related to farm gate to fork. This is one of the problems, particularly relating to BSE, the system being at the farm gate, not inside the farm. During the national beef assurance scheme debate the Labour Party argued for a completely integrated process from farm to fork, thus including that part of the chain that is now under scrutiny because of BSE, which is within the farm. That part of the food safety chain is still under the banner of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, it is not within the remit of the Food Safety Authority. Meat and bonemeal are monitored by the Department, not by the Food Safety Authority, as farm inspections are also within the remit of the Department. This again raises the validity of agriculture and food being a shared responsibility and the need to define unequivocally where responsibility for food safety rests. I again call for a complete review of those responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The Department has admitted there is no central record of inspections carried out by the district veterinary offices on the use of meat and bonemeal, as such inspections are invariably combined with other duties concerning disease prevention. While the level and quality of the inspection may well be adequate, it does not inspire confidence in the present climate. For an issue that has generated so much controversy, it surely would have been appropriate to hold a separate record of such inspections, in particular since 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE debate has raised the question of the value of quality assurance schemes and their implementation and management. I said during the last debate that quality assurance schemes are effective only if they are underpinned in law. There is no penalty for supplying a product of an <Col N="90" /> inferior standard to a processor, while operating within a quality scheme, other than the penalty selected or chosen by the purchaser of the product. The quality mark is meaningless in that case unless it is totally transparent and traceable. Quality systems are often no more than marketing tools, which will fast lose credibility if they are not properly managed and seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The Bord Bia quality assurance scheme is a voluntary initiative between Bord Bia and the pigmeat industry designed to underpin the marketing and promotion of Irish pigmeat. The principle of the quality scheme is good, in that, it anticipated consumer concerns and, accordingly, included a provision excluding from the scheme pigs fed with meat and bonemeal, but for quality systems to have any meaning, they must be legally binding, accountable and open to independent audit.</P>
    <P>When the meat and bonemeal ban was introduced initially, there was no sense of urgency and there was a fundamental misunderstanding of the mode of infection by BSE. What is of considerable concern with hindsight is the fact that many animals, which may have been sub-clinical, would no doubt have entered the food chain and been slaughtered without exhibiting any overt symptoms.</P>
    <P>The scientific view at present is that pigs are not naturally susceptible to BSE. In August 1990, experimental transmission of BSE to a pig by injection of infectious material into the brain was carried out. The lesson and the assumptions in relation to cattle and BSE should not be lost on us in relation to pigs. Species is an uncertain and unreliable barrier for the transmission of BSE. Strain typing of mice reveals that the disease patterns produced by the agents causing BSE and variant CJD are identical. We should not lose sight of the fundamental concern implicit in this debate, the risk to humans of new variant CJD.</P>
    <P>The single most important unanswered question about the BSE epidemic is whether BSE might become endemic in sheep. Research in this area is ongoing and very important to future recommendations in relation to BSE. I have raised again what I consider to be fundamental questions that need to be addressed openly about BSE and our lack of knowledge of the subject.</P>
    <P>Simple ante mortem and post mortem tests for BSE would have been of great practical value. This is an area of research that has to be pursued vigorously. The tests that are available, while useful, are limited. The question that now has to be answered is whether testing of all animals is worthwhile or whether a more radical approach should be taken, whereby all animals of a certain age are culled. Reliance on a test is limited by its sensitivity and any factors that will influence its effectiveness. Among the limitations is the fact that the test is post mortem only. It will not detect sub-clinical animals. All that can be said by way of assurance is the test has been carried out and the result was negative. The limits of that assertion need to be appreciated before any <Col N="91" /> extrapolations are made from it. It is no guarantee the animal is not harbouring BSE and might become clinical at some later stage. Absence of proof is not proof of absence. However, despite the limitations that have been identified, the test gives some measure of reassurance and it should be used for purposes of screening positive animals, in particular as the test result becomes available within 24 hours. However, the limitation of the test lends a sense of urgency to finding a test that detects positive animals pre-mortem and also detects sub-clinical cases.</P>
    <P>The disposal of specified risk material and infected animal carcases will not go away. The numbers continue to increase and no doubt with increased testing the number will increase further. As Deputy Dukes said, it is not tenable to continue to hold carcases in cold storage indefinitely and the need for incineration must be addressed. There is no simple solution to the disposal of infected carcases. The options are very limited and best practice, with state of the art technology, should serve to ensure safe disposal of infected carcases. The alternatives to incineration have already been firmly rejected.</P>
    <P>We like to adhere to the principle of quality Irish produce. Implicit in that assumption is that the food is truly Irish. I have referred already to the business of labelling and the subtle use of language to imply that a product is in fact of Irish origin, when in reality it has been imported and packaged in Ireland. It requires very careful study of the label to determine that the product was not of Irish origin. This is overtly misleading while legally correct. It is possible, for example, to buy a pack of rashers with a well known Irish brand name only to discover that the product has been produced outside Ireland and packaged here by the company. While the company is technically within the law, consumers are the losers in that they believe they are purchasing a product produced, processed and packaged in Ireland and made with Irish ingredients. It should be mandatory to have clear, unambiguous labelling identifying the country of origin. That applies not only to Irish products but to imports. At least then the consumer has no illusions about the origins of the product.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of labelling and traceability is that it is possible for a processor to buy in pig carcases from another country, process the carcase here and then label the product as Irish. Surely this makes a mockery of any quality scheme and is an insult to the consumer, who believes that they are buying a completely different product. The sooner we get around to applying country of origin labels to all foods the better.</P>
    <P>The role of the Government in risk management is primarily to reduce risk to a level that should be acceptable to the consumer. There is no such thing as zero risk, for the reasons I have covered in the previous debate, nor can we ever assure zero risk. It is not possible to prove the <Col N="92" /> absence of something. The best we can say is: &ldquo;It cannot be detected or it has not been detected.&rdquo;  Detection depends on the efficiency and sensitivity of the test method. If the test is not the right test or is not sufficiently sensitive, then it is possible that the material being tested for will not be detected.</P>
    <P>The policy of openness is by far the most effective when dealing with risk management. It is not wise to appear to have all the answers in a situation of uncertainty. Food scares thrive on the belief that those in charge are withholding information but if doubts are openly expressed and publicly explored, the public is capable of responding rationally and is much more likely to respond positively. In order to establish credibility it is important to build trust, which can only be established by openness. This in turn requires that there is recognition of uncertainty. Communication of this uncertainty is not easy against a background of assurances that have not materialised in the case of BSE and other food scares. A remote risk to human health was the basis of the continuing response to BSE in the UK but time, unfortunately, has proved different.</P>
    <P>Whatever tests are applied, it should be remembered that testing will not change the quality or safety of any product. It will simply tell us, depending on the sensitivity of the test, how good or bad the product is. The message to take from the BSE debate is that prevention is the key to safe, good quality food. The finished product is only as good as the raw materials from which it was made.</P>
    <P>Consumer confidence has been shattered by the BSE scare and the agriculture industry has been seriously damaged by the fall-out, some of it because of the behaviour of other countries. The task now is to restore confidence at home and abroad, by openness, accountability and best practice in the production, processing and handling of food.</P>

      <P>The disclosures of the past two weeks regarding the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, raise questions of the utmost seriousness, not just for the Minister of State but also for the Taoiseach. It is not perhaps surprising that the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, should have sought to duck and weave and avoid the central issues involved here but what is even more alarming is that the Taoiseach should have been complicit in trying to obscure the issues involved and that he should have once again failed to live up to the standards that the people have a right to expect of any Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Because of the seriousness of the issues concerned and because of the total abdication of responsibility, I move the following amendment to the Government's amendment No. 1 to the Fine Gael motion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> After the words &lsquo;scientific developments' to add the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and pending the outcome of the investigation by the Public Offices Commission resolves that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe be suspended from his position as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, had been a Minister in an Administration in any other democracy in Europe he would have gone within a matter of hours of the original disclosures. If he had been a Minister of State in any Irish Government, other than a Fianna Fáil dominated one, he would also have been out of office at least a week ago.</P>
    <P>Like most other people, I was shocked to read two weeks ago that the Minister of State with responsibility for overseeing the food sector, the man charged by the House and the people with ensuring food quality, was the joint owner of a farm which had been involved in feeding meat and bonemeal to pigs. This is the same Minister of State who in November 1997 launched a new code of practice for the pig industry and who warned that: &ldquo;pig producers must never lose sight of the fact that consumers and buyers of pigmeat for major retailers and catering establishments are now seeking only top quality products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While there may not have been anything illegal about the feeding of meat and bonemeal to pigs on the O'Keeffe farm, is it really the sort of example that we want from our Minister of State for food quality, having regard to the level of public concern about BSE and the impact of meat and bonemeal in this instance in Britain for several years? Any attempts by the Minister of State to suggest that he does not have any day to day role in the operation of the farm are not backed up by the facts. If that is the case why is it that he is reported to have until recently signed cheques for the farm? If that is the case, why is it that receipts for consignments of pigs for as recently as July 1999 were still in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe? What sort of standing or credibility does the Minister of State have when he sits down with other Ministers for food in the EU to discuss food quality matters, especially when the question of consumer confidence in pork products comes up? I suggest none at all.</P>
    <P>The disclosure that the Minister of State was involved in the feeding of meat and bonemeal would on its own have provided a compelling case for his removal from office. However, his failure to disclose his interests as required under the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Government's Cabinet guidelines renders it inconceivable that he should remain in office. Let us look at the facts.</P>
    <P>The Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (No. 2) Order, 1996, is made under the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 1996. The purpose of the order is to introduce a restrictive and regulated regime relating to the manu<Col N="94" /> facture, purchase and use as animal feed of mammalian meat and bonemeal in order to combat the spread of BSE. Article 6 of the order restricts the possession and use of mammalian meat and bonemeal, except in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister of State's family farm, his interests in which are registered under section 5 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, has such a licence and is, accordingly, entitled to feed bonemeal to pigs. It appears that there are only 17 such licences in the State and freedom of information requests have not, up to now, made the Minister disclose the holders of those licences but with the pressure he is now under he has disclosed them to the House tonight. Did he discuss that with the licence holders or his justification for not disclosing them earlier?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Private Members' motion debated on 29 and 30 November last called for a ban on the feeding of bonemeal to all animals. The effect of the motion then, if carried into effect, would undoubtedly have been to revoke the licences and the financial benefit which they conferred. The Offical Report shows that the Minister of State both spoke and voted on the Labour Party motion. At no stage did he declare his interest in its outcome. It is of course the case that, while the Minister of State had registered his interest in the farm, the annual registration requirements do not extend to a requirement to register his licence holding in meat and bonemeal but that the possession of such a licence amounted to a material interest in the context of proceedings on this motion in the Dáil must now be clear.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there was a responsibility on the Minister of State that at a time when material effect would be made by a Dáil decision on a Labour Party motion it was incumbent on him to divulge that information to the Dáil. That is an essential part of the ethics legislation we have accepted for ourselves as the standard we must apply. The fact that the Minister of State either does not understand or has evaded those responsibilities does not mean that those of us who want to point that out to him are witchhunting, as he implied when speaking. We are demanding that the standards that this House accepted for itself are understood by the Members and complied with by everyone. Mistakes can be made but there must be consequences. If a material interest is to accrue to an individual by virtue of a decision of the House there is a legal requirement for that to be disclosed in the context of that debate, either if the Member is going to vote or certainly if the Member is going to contribute. That was not done in this case.</P>
    <P>These matters will be adjudicated on by the Public Offices Commission but the Labour Party feels that in the context of the critical issues at stake here, public confidence not only in this State but internationally in our food industry, the person charged with food quality in the State <Col N="95" /> must be beyond reproach. For those reasons it is important that the Minister of State accepts the responsibilities now demanded of him.</P>

      <P>In highlighting the fact that this was a budget for children, the first budget in the history of State for children, in the earlier part of my contribution I focused on foster care, the new allowances for foster parents and the value of the work of those foster parents. My main aim, and that of all of us, would be to support children in their own families and ensure that they do not go into care because the best place for any child is in his or her own family. For that reason, in the context of the budget allocated for children, an extra £2 million is being allocated to family support as well.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of services and supports being given to families in different areas throughout the country provided by statutory organisations through the health boards and by the voluntary organisations. These services and supports are given to children who are deemed to be at risk from an early stage, whose families might need support at that early stage and who are then supported right through the process.</P>
      <P>The projects that we will be extending include the teenage parenting project, which works through the maternity hospitals to focus on those young people who need extra help. I am also thinking of people in their own local environments where we might have springboard projects. We have announced an extra two projects, one in Darndale and one in Loughlinstown, to support those families and their children in an integrated manner so that they do not have to spend their time trying to work through the council, the corporation, the health board or the schools but that those services come to them in a recognised way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other family support projects and an evaluation of those during the year highlighted that these family support projects work. <Col N="96" /> For that reason I am totally committed to ensuring that they are extended and that we target children at a young age in the context of their own families to ensure they do not find themselves in need of coming into care but that where they do come into care, the best possible care is given to them.</P>
    <P>Having referred already to foster care, the next stage of our continuum of care is residential care, another area which needs investment and particular support. Last week I announced that an extra £7.139 million has been allocated to residential care. That is in addition to the money already being spent and in addition to the capital allocation being spent to upgrade and build facilities, particularly for children who are coming before the courts and who have special needs and behavioural disorders. Our challenge is not in building those facilities; our building programme is well on target. We have increased from 17 places when the Government came into office to 74 places. Our challenge is in the staffing of those places and to ensure that we get the very best care and therapeutic support for children with behavioural disorders. That is the aim.</P>
    <P>Another major aim is to ensure that children who are in care have the support and guidance they need to leave care. Unfortunately, we have seen research which shows that the children who leave care are the people who end up most vulnerable and homeless. For that reason, this year we allocated money to the Mid-Western Health Board to devise models of care for our young people to enable them to reintegrate back into society. I have asked each of the health boards to ensure that in spending their money they give special attention not just to looking after the children currently in their care but to prepare them for after care.</P>
    <P>Another key element for residential care is a social services inspectorate which we launched earlier this year. That inspectorate has come up with some serious findings and it is crucial that the health boards now act on those findings, improve conditions and ensure that they are putting in place the care plans for their children, that their staff are qualified and that they are given the necessary supports. For that reason, this budget has allocated an extra £250,000 for the social services inspectorate.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year, and indeed at any time of the year, we are conscious of the numbers of young people who end up homeless on our streets. These are people who, for a variety of reasons &ndash; I have met them and their reasons are very diverse &ndash; have found they are unable to remain within their own family structures because of violence, drug abuse or alcohol. They do not have a structure to support them. Our aim in this society must be to ensure that children do not find themselves on the street and that there are enough outreach workers to ensure that young people who need care and support get that care and support in their own home areas. That will prevent them coming into the inner city because <Col N="97" /> there is a street life and it can be difficult for them to break out of that.</P>
    <P>An extra £5 million, which is a total of £7 million in a full year, was allocated by the Minister for Finance for youth homelessness this year. This money will allow us to target the city areas generally, but particularly the Dublin area, to ensure that we have emergency accommodation. Three new centres have been brought on-stream with 30 places, two of which are opening this month. One of those centres is in the Meath Hospital where beds will be made available for young people who need them.</P>
    <P>We will also have outreach teams on the streets making contact with these young people and offering them the support they need. We will have downstream residential places to enable people to work towards reintegration and, most importantly, we will be appointing 300 additional child care staff in the eastern region alone to focus on the needs of these young people, ensure that they do not become homeless and that, where they do, we are able to respond to them on an emergency basis and in the long-term as well.</P>
    <P>All of this should be seen in the context of our national children strategy which we launched last month. That strategy maps out for the next ten years the way we will provide services and supports for our young people. The strategy will be co-ordinated and driven by a national children's office which will ensure that all children's needs are met and that each Department is living up to its responsibility in looking after children. The budget allocated money for that office to ensure that each Department can work, be driven and that all of our children's needs are met.</P>
    <P>The major need has to be the elimination of child poverty. Page one of the strategy sets that out as one of our aims. The targets must now be set by the social partners to ensure that each of them works together, and not just to deal with child poverty or to focus on it. In this document it is stated for the first time that we will eliminate child poverty. The increases in child benefit in the budget go a long way towards doing that. The removal of the 133,000 people out of the tax net also helps families and children. Focusing on and giving more to the lower paid will also ensure a better value of life for all of our children in achieving the main aim of our strategy, a strategy for all children, which is to eliminate child poverty. The other aims are to ensure that children have a voice, that their needs are understood and that they get the supports and benefits they need. That voice will be heard in a number of ways, one of which will be in the establishment of the office of the ombudsman for children. An allocation was made in the budget for the establishment of that office which will be yet another support for our children to ensure their voice is heard at different levels.</P>
    <P>The whole area of adoption will get extra funding. The direction in the past few years towards inter-country adoption needs special support <Col N="98" /> because of the length of time it is taking for assessments to be carried out and the number of social workers which are needed to carry out those assessments in a professional way. The budget allocated for the whole area of adoption, £660,000, will assist not just in revamping the Adoption Board but also in ensuring that couples who wish to look to Russia or to China can get their assessments quickly and get the support that they need.</P>
    <P>This budget focuses very much on children in the context of their families. It focuses on children who have to come into care by supporting foster care with a huge increase in allowances of over 180%. It focuses on them in residential care, on the most vulnerable where they are homeless and, most particularly, it focuses on all children to ensure that their voice is heard and that they all get a better quality of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The budget for 2001 provides a coherent framework for ensuring further economic growth on top of the record-breaking growth achieved by the economy in recent years. Economic growth shows no sign of diminishing from the remarkably strong rates recorded recently. The preliminary national accounts indicate that real gross domestic product, GDP, increased by 9.8% in 1999, while the most recent quarterly national accounts from the Central Statistics Office indicate that real GDP maintained its strong growth into the first quarter of 2000.</P>
      <P>The most remarkable performance indicator of the strength of the economy is the dramatic fall in the unemployment rate throughout the year. The rate is estimated to be 3.7% for the final quarter of 2000, averaging 4% for the year. This is a 1.5 percentage point decline in one year or, even more spectacularly, a 7.5 percentage point fall since 1996. As the Economic and Social Research Institute &ndash; ESRI &ndash; points out in its recent quarterly economic commentary, &ldquo;The jobless growth phenomenon of the early stages of the Celtic tiger has certainly been overcome&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is committed to promoting enhanced competition in the economy. To achieve this it is necessary that the conditions agreed by the social partners in the recently renegotiated Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF &ndash; are adhered to. Obviously the renegotiation was required to compensate for the erosion in real incomes. The PPF also allows for the prospect of benchmarking pay terms in the public sector to reflect market forces. Given the rapid tightening of the labour market, the implementation of this process has the prospect of preserving a balance of skilled workers, both entrant and experienced, throughout the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road haulage sector faces many challenges both internationally and at home. Stiff competition, traffic congestion and the development of <Col N="99" /> a more professional structure all put pressure on the viability of the sector. We are all well aware that the road haulage industry, both in Ireland and throughout Europe, has been going through a traumatic period recently, brought about by a sustained rise in oil prices on world markets. In the budget the Minister for Finance has provided for relief on excise duty on diesel of 6p per litre, equivalent to the relief sought by the hauliers in their recent protests. Certain other budget measures will also have a positive effect on the sector. This response represents recognition of the challenge and pressures facing this important economic sector in the fiscal context.</P>
    <P>Following the day of action organised by the Irish Road Haulage Association last September, a task force on road haulage issues was set up under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach's Department. In addition to representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association, officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are represented on the task force. The task force was asked to consider and draw up a programme of action which recognises the need for a comprehensive and concerted effort by all interested parties to address the structural problems of the road haulage sector. The work of the task force is nearing completion and a package of measures has been formulated which addresses the concerns of the haulage industry. The programme of action is designed to underpin the importance of a professional and economically viable road haulage sector to the national economy and the part it plays in the successful implementation of the national development plan. Given the responsible way it addressed the serious issues which recently confronted it, no sector is better deserving of the recognition the Government has given at the highest level to the road haulage sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to sustainable development of the energy sector is reflected in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy which I published in September 1999. The policies and plans set out in the Green Paper were subsequently an integral part of the national development plan where a provision of £146 million has been secured to promote energy efficiency through information and education programmes; promote research and development in energy efficiency and CO2 abatement; promote alternative energy; and improve the energy efficiency of the pre-1980 housing stock and Government and local authority buildings. Intensified promotion of energy efficiency and the development of significant renewable energy electricity generation will be central to energy policy in the context of Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre will be the main conduit of the energy conservation and efficiency <Col N="100" /> programmes. Under the Green Paper and the recently published National Climate Change Strategy, an increased role is envisaged for the IEC in implementing Government policy on sustainable and renewable energy. In accordance with the proposals in the Green Paper, the IEC will be established as an independent statutory body. The Government has given its sanction for the heads of a Bill to be formally drafted and I hope to have the legislation published in the early part of 2001. I am pleased to say that I have appointed an interim board to the centre under the chairmanship of Professor Frank Convery of the environmental studies unit of University College Dublin. I am satisfied that under the new board the centre will develop the necessary programmes and source adequate staff resources for the challenge ahead.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to significantly increase the contribution of renewable sources of energy to meeting our energy needs and in the Green Paper I announced the establishment of a renewable energy strategy group to report on the obstacles to the further development of the renewable energy sector. The strategy group's report was published last July and the group presented a short and medium-term strategy and a number of recommendations. The report and subsequent responses received by me from players in the wind energy industry have been considered within my Department and I am pleased there is now sufficient consensus to move forward subject to the approval of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The promotion of renewable energy is an important aspect of the mandate of the Irish Energy Centre and I have set an increased target of 500mw of electricity generation by 2005. This generation of electricity through renewable sources is also an important element in our efforts to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>The current economic success has given rise to challenges, and energy consumption is no exception. Future growth can only continue in an environment of new and innovative approaches to both generation and supply. Natural gas has become a major contributor to the energy needs of all sectors and is playing an increasingly greater role in the production of electricity. Under the 1998 EU gas directive a new market environment has been created.</P>
    <P>I am a strong proponent of the liberalisation agenda for the natural gas market. Today we have a 75% opening of the gas market. My target is full market opening as soon as is practicable. To allow for the effective operation of the liberalised market I recognise the need for an independent regulator. In this regard, my Department is working on legislation that will allow for the expansion of the role of the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation to include regulation of the gas market. I hope to have this legislation in place by mid-2001.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the need to maintain security of supply. Ireland is serviced by two gas sup<Col N="101" /> plies, Kinsale and the Ireland-UK interconnector. With the Kinsale supply declining and the interconnector near full capacity, a variety of supply options, including the Corrib gas field, have been proposed. The latest indications are that due to growing demand we will require new gas supply capacity by the winter of 2002 to avoid supply shortages. This is a year sooner than had been anticipated only a short while ago. The position will crystallise in the coming days when the ESRI completes its energy demand forecasts. It is of the utmost importance to our national competitiveness that our energy supply is not jeopardised. I have made it clear in the past that security of supply is of paramount importance and I will ensure that this remains the case when it comes to approving new supply infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The changes in the natural gas market that we are currently witnessing will provide competition, greater consumer choice and greater security of supply. Ultimately I am confident that these changes will foster the growth of an energy market capable of supporting our continued economic success.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, this Government is firmly committed in its opposition to the continued operation and expansion of the nuclear industry, particularly the nuclear industry in the UK. Like its predecessors, it has rejected the nuclear power option because it believes the claimed benefits of nuclear power are significantly outweighed by the risks to public health, safety and the environment. Sellafield has long been a source of grave concern to successive Governments and the people. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland plays an important role in supporting the Government's ongoing campaign against Sellafield's operations.</P>
    <P>This Government has recently approved the introduction of a radon remediation grant scheme. I am pleased to announce that my Department has been allocated £1.559 million in its Vote for 2001 for the introduction of such a scheme which will assist householders in undertaking radon remediation measures for their homes. The specific details of the scheme will be settled by a steering committee comprising my Department, the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government and the RPII. I expect to announce details of the scheme in the new year. The scheme will be up and running in the second half of next year.</P>
    <P>The Geological Survey of Ireland is an agency of my Department. It is the national geological agency and its work supports decision making in many sectors of national life, including resource management, environmental protection and hazard abatement. Its products are in the form of maps, reports and databases which document the geological features of Ireland's landscapes, as well as their mineral and groundwater potential. An important development in the work of the Geological Survey occurred last year when the Government directed that it manage a comprehensive survey of the Irish seabed area. The scale <Col N="102" /> of this challenge will be appreciated when it is realised that the seabed covers an area which is ten times larger than our land area. I am pleased to report that surveying in the deeper waters has already commenced and almost 25% of these waters have now been covered. This work is being carried out by Irish contractors, Global Ocean Technologies Limited, who are world class leaders in seabed mapping. Surveying in shallower waters will commence in 2002 when the Marine Institute's new vessel is commissioned. It will be an important part of the survey to build national capacity in marine geological science and this joint venture between the Marine Institute and the Geological Survey will be critical in achieving this.</P>
    <P>In an organisation like the Geological Survey, the management and distribution of the information it requires is its most important task. The Geological Survey is seeking to respond to the challenge of the information society by making its information available digitally and, eventually, on the Internet. This task is being undertaken with support from the Government's information society initiative and will make information more accessible to customers.</P>
    <P>Finally turning to aviation matters, the Irish Aviation Authority has embarked on a major capital investment programme to cover the period 2000-05. The bulk of this expenditure will be spent on the construction and equipping of a new air traffic control centre at Shannon. In addition, the authority plans to upgrade the air traffic systems at Dublin and Cork airports. The shell of the new air traffic centre was completed earlier this year and equipping of the centre has recently commenced. The project will be completed by 2003. There is no financial risk to the state arising from this project, which will be funded by the Aviation Authority from profits and borrowings. The full cost will be recouped over time by the authority from airlines through user charges.</P>
    <P>The construction and equipping of the new en-route air traffic control centre at Shannon is considered necessary by the authority to ensure it has a centre which can handle the projected growth in air traffic overlying Irish controlled airspace; be sufficiently flexible in modular terms to facilitate further expansion as the need arises; enable the next generation of equipment to be installed that will meet new system requirements and position the authority to expand Irish controlled airspace on the North Atlantic should the opportunity arise.</P>
    <P>I consider this budget by far the fairest, the most caring and the most positively accepted and acclaimed budget in our State's history and I compliment the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said the budget was the fairest, the most caring and the most positively accepted and acclaimed budget. It was also the budget in which we saw the greatest give away of money. We are lucky to be living in times where a Minister has at his disposal such <Col N="103" /> money to hand out. As he said himself and as other commentators have said, he is only giving back to the people what the State has taken from them. He is lucky to be in the position he is in. A couple of seats the other way and it would have been a Minister from this side of the House in his position. When the Minister and the Government took office in 1997, the country was doing extremely well. I am not saying the Rainbow Government, which was before my time here, was totally responsible. Successive Governments, groups and organisations in our society have worked for many years to bring us to the position in which we are today. We have a lot for which to be thankful and to celebrate.</P>
      <P>The debate is not so much about how much money the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs can give old age pensioners now as against what was given in 1997. I thought the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for whom I have great respect was a bit childish when he came into the House and said that they were giving so much to old age pensioners but that we only gave so much in 1997. We could all play that game; we could all go back over the years and say five years before that, the Fianna Fáil led Government only gave so much and so on. The debate has gone beyond that.</P>
      <P>Let us look at where we are now and let us see how well we are managing what we have for the current needs. Any of us could dig into history and start to throw muck at the other side but I do not think that is positive. The debate should centre on whether the Minister and the Government are managing the success we have in the best way possible. Are there alternative ways in which it could be managed? Could it be done in a better way than is being done? </P>
      <P>When one is giving away £4.5 billion plus, it would be hard to do something wrong and yet inflation is at 8% approximately. Why is that? It is not the same in the rest of Europe. People are saying it is the oil crisis, the price of oil. Is it solely the price of oil? Surely other Europeans are paying a similar price for oil. People are saying it is the euro differential. Surely other European countries have similar problems with the euro. I know we are tied to the UK in a different kind of way. Maybe there are other factors at play and the Government should look beyond the twin excuses it is putting forward &ndash; oil and the euro. Maybe other things are going on in our society.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to use the resources at his disposal in the Department to examine what else might be causing this inflation. The Government is putting forward the mantra of oil and euro in the hope that is the only reason for inflation. I think there may be other issues there. It is up to the Government to examine and check if there are other issues which might be causing inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main areas in which inflation is impacting is on housing and the cost of housing. We all know from our constituents, media reports and so on that young people and, indeed, older <Col N="104" /> people are finding it extraordinarily difficult to buy a home of their own so much so that tens of thousands of people are falling back on hard pressed local authority housing. Surely that is something we should try to avoid at all costs. On the Government's policy on housing, the three Bacon reports are not working as they should. They have taken the investor out of the market.</P>
    <P>In other countries there is a strong private rented sector which is controlled, regulated and fair to all sides. Perhaps that is something we should look at here and begin to develop that culture. Many young people may not be willing to purchase their own homes as they may not want this terrible weight of debt around their necks for the rest of their lives. If people cannot afford to purchase their own homes perhaps we should look at developing a private rented sector that is fair to the person renting the property and to the person leasing the property. The person renting a home will know there are certain things which are the responsibility of the landlord and certain things which are his own responsibility, that the rent will be controlled up to a certain point which is fair to both sides, that evictions can take place with good reason and so on. It can be done and is done elsewhere. I do not know why it cannot be done here. It should be examined critically.</P>
    <P>The lack of available accommodation also impacts on students. More could have been done in the budget for third-level students who must prove poverty in order to get a grant from the State. Those of us who have contact with students know the costs they have to incur. The grant is so small that it barely covers low rental costs and low rental accommodation is generally in a terrible condition. Students are forced out to work in order to be able to go to college and that can impact on their studies. Will the Government look at the issue of the third-level grant? The ceiling is too low and the maximum grant of £1,700 which students receive is also too low. How could anyone be expected to survive on that? To get the grant one's parents have to be poor and unable to afford to support the student.</P>
    <P>The rent-a-room scheme is a good idea and, perhaps, the Minister could have done more with it. I hope he will expand it in future years. He could look at it in the Finance Bill to see whether it can be expanded. If an old age pensioner in receipt of the living alone allowance rents a room will he or she lose his or her allowance? Provision to ensure that does not happen could be made in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Also on the theme of housing, every evening when I leave Leinster House and walk to where I stay I pass five, six, seven or ten people lying on the sidewalk. If the Minister goes out tonight and walks around the city he will find young and old lying in doorways and on sidewalks covered up in blankets or pieces of cardboard. When a Minister is giving away £4.5 billion and some of our citizens are sleeping in such conditions there is something terribly wrong. I challenge the Government <Col N="105" />&ndash; the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin said something about it earlier &ndash; to immediately set up a task force to ensure the homeless are looked after. While some work is being done in this area, more needs to be done. Social workers are needed on the street to find out why people are there and to help get them off the street. There is an outcry every time one of these people suffers a calamity, injury or death. The Minister should do something about this and it would not cost a huge amount.</P>
    <P>In the course of various debates in recent days Deputies have tried to raise the issue of the teachers' dispute. This comes down to finance. We have been calling for a commission on teaching similar to the commission on nursing. While we have pressed the Minister, he has not responded to that suggestion. There is something fundamentally wrong in the education system when teachers are on strike at a time when the Minister for Finance is giving away £4.5 billion. There is something fundamentally wrong when a teachers' union is pushed into a corner and forced to press the nuclear button and is talking about boycotting and sabotaging examinations. That should not happen in the present economic climate. The Minister for Education and Science should invite all the teacher unions to a meeting and stay in there until it is sorted out. It has to be sorted out at some stage and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>One set of students is losing much tuition time while another set has continuous tuition. While both sets of students will face an examination at the end of the year there will be some inequality among students. Given that it is a competitive examination for points, it is imperative that the Minister moves on this. I do not want to see the Christmas recess come and go because whatever pressure is on him now to resolve it there will be no pressure on him during the Christmas period. He should work before the end of January to resolve this dispute.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I had a 'phone call from a gentleman who is waiting for a serious operation. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister asking when he would have his operation. He had been waiting for some time. I was told he would have it in about two years. There is something fundamentally wrong with that. I had another 'phone call this evening from a constituent who is waiting for a back operation. He got a half promise that his operation would take place in June, July or October. Finally he was told he would get a bed next week. However, he was asked to telephone beforehand to ensure the bed would be available. He telephoned today and was told, &ldquo;Sorry, the bed is not available. You have got to wait until after Christmas or maybe we will get you in just before Christmas&rdquo;. This is not good enough. This man is in severe pain.</P>
    <P>While the Youth Work Bill is going through the Dáil I did not see any provision in the budget for youth activities. This is an area in which we need to invest heavily. Speaking on the Youth <Col N="106" /> Work Bill the Minister said we depend a great deal on volunteers. I have news for the Minister. In the Ireland of the Celtic tiger and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the volunteer is a dying breed in society. People no longer have time. They are rushing from post to pillar. We read articles in newspapers about stress. Psychiatrists are giving out packs to deal with stress. If the Minister is serious about youth work he had better invest heavily in it and pay professional workers to go out on to the streets to work with young people at risk. The youth clubs and youth services need a large professional back-up service. Now is the time to provide it. A lot of money is being invested in mainstream education and the prison service. However, there is a gap in the middle, a twilight zone where young people are on the streets after school getting into all kinds of bother. Such young people need to be targeted and assisted.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who are at risk. However, there are also the young people who are not at risk and of whom we are proud. A youth service has a serious developmental aspect. A properly resourced, funded and structured youth service acts as an informal education mechanism. We could not give Foróige, for example, enough money and there are many similar youth organisations in the country at the moment. They need properly trained and resourced youth workers to work in the community and assist our young people to grow socially.</P>
    <P>The public house is often the only place our young people can go if they want to interact with each other. We need comfortable youth centres in most of our towns, rather than just a few chairs in an unattractive place that is draughty and cold. Young people will no longer go to such places but will go to the local pub instead. We need a properly resourced and funded youth service. I saw nothing in the budget to show the Government is serious or cares about that.</P>
    <P>A fair amount of money was allocated to combat sports. However, there are a lot of other sports in our society that need money. They have to come forward with their begging bowls every year and make submissions for funding from the national lottery. Many of these organisations do a lot of good work. This was the time to recognise that work but we did not do it.</P>
    <P>A woman told me today that it costs her £25 every time she brings her child to the doctor. We could have done more for children under five years and their parents. There are huge costs involved in taking children to the doctor. A woman told me that it cost £37 to deal with just one illness.</P>
    <P>We talk about the stress, inflation and pressure in our society. The child care debate has gone on for some time. I will not repeat the arguments here because they are known. We need to do more work in that area.</P>
    <P>We spoke earlier about farmers. I was disappointed with the budget provisions for farmers. The BSE crisis received passing mention. The <Col N="107" /> Minister said today there are no plans to make moneys available to assist farmers who are suffering hugely because of the BSE crisis. I would like the Government to bring forward some plans in that area before Christmas. There are people on family farms who are extremely worried and are about to lose a lot of money. The Agri-Food 2010 report said the number of family farms will decrease dramatically over the next ten years. I hope that will not happen. It will be a choice that farmers will have to make, but I hope the Government will do everything in its power to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, stood up to speak tonight there were just two Deputies in the Chamber. There are a few more of us here now. I hope this institution will be reformed because many of our activities are archaic. It might take money to do that. I hope the suggestions put forward by my party, the Government, the Labour Party and others will be worked on soon. We need to do something to generate more interest in what we do here.</P>
    <P>We need facilities such as swimming pools in our towns and cities. There is no public swimming pool in my area of east Cork. I have asked many times for that in this House over the past three and a half years but it has not been granted yet. Perhaps it will happen before Christmas.</P>
    <P>We need to develop our rail service. I do not think one new length of rail track has been laid since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Government could not have done too much wrong in the budget as it had so much money to give away. However, I wonder about the Government policy of importing employment and workers. Deputy Noonan recently questioned that. Ministers make announcements about the importation of 5,000, 3,000 or 2,000 jobs around the country. The Tánaiste then goes to the other end of the world to find workers to fill those jobs. I would like to hear the Government's overall thinking and policy in this area. As Deputy Noonan said, the budget seemed to have been designed by a committee. A fundamental question is whether we would be better off looking carefully at this stage at whether it is wise to import thousands of jobs and then having to bring in thousands of workers to do them. Is there a mismatch there? Perhaps I am missing something and am wrong in this regard.</P>

      <P>In addressing the budget, I would like to set my remarks in the context of the framework the Minister for Finance announced on budget day. He set out four objectives, to secure continued prosperity, to improve the quality of life, to promote a fairer society and to reward work and enterprise through ongoing tax reform. We are entitled to regard those objectives as the benchmarks for what he set out to achieve.</P>
      <P>I will not deal with the minutiae of the budget in terms of the various aspects of it listed in the Budget Statement which have been well documented over recent days. However, there are aspects of it which stand out and are worthy of comment. There has been reaction to the budget in terms of the state of our economy. Our economy is strong at present, and Members of all parties can claim a certain amount of credit for their contributions to it. At the same time, most people realise that if the engine is running well, it should be brought in for a service at regular intervals. I question whether we are taking the necessary precautions in relation to a strong economy.</P>
      <P>We talk about the Celtic tiger, a term coined by an economist some years ago. However, the Celtic tiger bears a fair degree of analysis. I have said publicly on many occasions that I have worries and certain concerns about the Celtic tiger. That is not to take from its success, particularly in the latter half of the 1990s. However, we have become very dependent on American investment. I do not think one could argue against the person who says it is an American tiger located in Ireland. We have all gone out in the past 20 years, as did people before us, to bring in foreign investment. That has been very successful since the 1960s, although it has had its ups and downs throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My personal experience of foreign investment, which was shared by Limerick, Longford and Tullamore and my home town, was the great Burlington investment in the 1970s. At one stage it employed almost 2,000 people in Tralee. It is long gone, but at the time, like the Fruit of the Loom industry in County Donegal, it looked like a very attractive industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a day when the Irish-American relationship is manifest in events in this city today, it is ironic to note that 1,000 US companies are located in Ireland while approximately 100 of them are responsible for 50% of exports. Despite this, there is insufficient investment in research and development to sustain them and the Irish output from them. While IDA Ireland and SFADCo have been very successful, it must be asked if we have done enough to sustain their success. We will not if we do not have the investment in R&amp;D. Under the science and technology programme a framework for this is being put in place. Despite this I have no sense from the <Col N="109" /> Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance and subsequent contributions to the budget debate of what direction the Government wants the economy to take over the next four to five years. Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb.</P>
    <P>It is very important to prepare for the next phase of the development of this society. It will involve research and development and brain power. We need reassurances from the Government that it is doing what is necessary to put in place the wherewithal to enable us continue with the phenomenal economic growth rates and with the improvements in society.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether the economic growth has been shared in the creation of a fairer society. Independent judges would say we have not succeeded. Most parties in this House would say they have a political objective to promote a fairer society, yet if that is subject to critical analysis many in our society would say they have not shared the benefits of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>A number of industries are in crisis. There was a debate a couple of weeks ago and again this week on the crisis facing a very important sector. I do not wish to cut across my colleague, Deputy Penrose, my party's spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, but we have not yet faced up to the depth of the crisis Irish agriculture is facing. In the middle of 1997 the Minister, Deputy Walsh, then Opposition spokesman on Agriculture, asked to be given six weeks during which time he said he would have exports to Egypt resumed. It does not work like that. If we are to succeed in our exports we must set and observe standards. Exports are the linchpin of our agricultural communities.</P>
    <P>The Government is in denial with regard to the agricultural sector while the leadership of the agricultural organisations are in denial about the levels of crisis facing the industry. I do not refer to the week to week fluctuations in the price of cattle and exports but the direction of Irish agriculture <i>vis-à-vis</i> what is happening in the rest of the world. It is time we looked at what is happening to world pricing in the US, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
    <P>It is also time for the politicians and the leadership of the agricultural organisations to face up to the serious difficulties in the industry. We can fix things on a day to day, patchwork basis and the Minister can travel to Egypt with the aim or reopening the market, as he did after the EU Council of Ministers meeting last week. However, that is only a short-term solution. We must secure long-term markets and security for the industry. We must also make serious decisions in the foreseeable future about the nature of the agricultural community. We have not accepted, reacted or responded correctly to what is happening in world markets. It is vital to do so if we are to address the serious problems we face.</P>
    <P>A litmus test of a fair society is the quality of the health services it provides. There have been good and bad years in relation to the health services and many debates have been held in the <Col N="110" /> House on the quality of the services provided. Unfortunately, they continue to be open to the few but inaccessible to the bulk of the population. Any politician can say that spending has been doubled &ndash; that has happened over the past four or five years &ndash; but the level of spending does not matter if somebody cannot get access to the services.</P>
    <P>The orthodontic service for school children has broken down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not available. Every Member of this House, including I suspect Ministers, will have written to the Minister for Health and Children inquiring about access to this service. We tell people we are trying to secure a service, but with due respect to those who are trying to maintain it, the children will have outgrown the service before anything can be done for them. I ask the Minister for Finance if we are creating a fair society when there is no access to the health services.</P>
      <P>The relatively new Minister for Health and Children &ndash; he was a successful Minister for Education and Science &ndash; has taken on a very difficult brief. I wish him well. However, ultimately, it is not a matter of whether we spend £3 billion, £4 billion or £5 billion but whether people can have access to hospitals and medical care so that they do not have to be on trolleys or waiting lists. That test will be put to the Minister.</P>
      <P>More consultants are needed. For some reason we appear to have an incapacity to appoint new ones, but without qualified consultants we cannot provide the services required. The country has a proud record in education, yet not enough has been invested in this area to provide the necessary people to give the service required.</P>
      <P>With regard to the continuation of the prosperity and the quality of life, the Government is fortunate that the economy is doing well, otherwise society would be in chaos. The teachers' strike is an example. Lest I am accused of being biased I should declare an interest because a member of my family is studying for the leaving certificate. It is unfair to the students who want to sit their leaving certificate examinations. Not only the teachers, but railway and airline workers are on strike on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education system is at a crossroads. As a society we must decide if we want to pay our teachers an adequate amount of money to keep them in the profession. We all know what they would get paid in the private sector. All Members of this House are proud of the opportunities afforded them because of the education they received, made available to us through the sacrifice of others. Teaching is a public service in the same way as nursing. Teachers feel they are being left behind. It behoves the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, a very experienced politician, to consult with the teaching profession and find a resolution to this conflict. In the <Col N="111" /> interests of the examinations that are due to commence with the oral examinations next spring, it should be resolved before Christmas.</P>
    <P>At times people say we spend too much on the public service. However, we will not keep the economy going unless we maintain quality in the education system. We have been proud of the education system over the years and we have invested much in it. We have obtained value for money. It must be asked why should people go into the teaching profession when they see the salaries they could make by working in the private sector. While it is fine to celebrate the success of the economy and what has happened in Dublin today, we should not confront students with what they may have to face over the coming months. I urge the Taoiseach to consult the teaching profession and the unions and find a way to solving their difficulty.</P>
    <P>One only has to walk around the streets of Dublin to see how little effect a fairer society, continued prosperity and an improving quality of life have on so many people. It was brought home to us dramatically last week when an individual who was sleeping homeless rescued a bus driver from the River Liffey and then went back to sleep in his wet clothes in the location in which he had been previously. There is no reason any one individual in our society should be sleeping homeless in our towns and cities. That needs to be addressed. With the resources in our economy and the collective effort of the Government, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in particular, there is no reason any citizen should have to sleep rough at night-time. The numbers are manageable and facilities should be provided for them.</P>
    <P>Our infrastructure is being addressed but not with the urgency it requires. The country and the city of Dublin are virtually at a standstill. This is a successful economy, but there is absolute frustration in terms of the movement within it. I am sure many Deputies who are members of county councils are aware of the planning situation. We do not have planners. When a local representative contacts the planning office it is virtually impossible to get a response on what might or might not happen with a planning application. One will get the answer from the computer that the application has been received and a decision will be made in two months' time. It is different from ten or 15 years ago when one was entitled to consult and would get a considered response. The infrastructure deficit of which we are all aware is approximately £15 billion to £20 billion. It is an urgent matter which must be addressed in the short-term rather than the long-term if we want to maintain our economy.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about one aspect dramatically missing from the budget which the Government may have to come back to early in the new year. The Minister boasted in the budget that there are now 668,000 people out of the tax net. It is a <Col N="112" /> phenomenal figure, but it works two ways. We are admitting there are 668,000 people in our working community who are not earning adequate salaries to be able to pay tax. That is a sad reflection on the Celtic tiger. In fairness to the Minister, who was carefully watched in 2000, which he had not been in 1999 when he made the individualisation mess, he was drawn between both parties in Government. He gave a little bit to a lot of people but he took a lot of it back in terms of PRSI, in a country which is trying to continually attract industry. However, he failed miserably by not setting out a vision for where this country will be in three to five years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week's budget represented the biggest ever spending spree by any Minister for Finance, but the people on the lowest incomes continue to live in unacceptable poverty. It is clear from the analysis done all week by many people that those who earn the most are gaining the most, while those who earn the least are suffering the most and they have benefited only little from the budget.</P>
      <P>There were some commendable measures in the budget, such as the medical card for people over 70 years of age and the increase in child benefit. However, more could have been done. The medical card provisions could have been made wider to include all pensioners. The Labour Party would recommend free primary care for all citizens. This is a viable option given our current economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>The groups which fared the worst are those dependent on social welfare. An £8 increase for people on the basic rates is inadequate. In the past 12 months we have seen social welfare incomes totally eaten away by inflation. These increases neither compensate people for the effects of inflation nor protect them from possible inflation hikes in the coming year. At the very least, those on the basic social welfare rates, such as widows, carers and people with a disability, should have been given a minimum increase of approximately £11. The money was there to go well beyond this and that is why the Labour Party advocated a £14 increase in advance of the budget. The failure of the Government to increase the fuel allowance, for example, which has remained at the same level for the past ten years is disappointing.</P>
      <P>The hype which preceded the budget in relation to increases in the rate of old age contributory pensions was unwarranted. There was enough money to do more for pensioners than the £10 across the board increase announced. The £10 scarcely compensates for the impact inflation has had on their incomes over the past year. Non-contributory pensions remain under £100 per week and the majority of people in receipt of the non-contributory rate are women. This compounds the growing problem of poverty among older women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budgetary provision to extend the fuel allowance for an additional three weeks of the <Col N="113" /> year was abysmal. It beggars belief as to why the Government bothered to make changes to this allowance. Three weeks extra fuel allowance means only three days extra fuel. The level of the fuel allowance has remained static for ten years and it bears no relation to the current price of fuel. Those who most require the fuel allowance, the old and the sick, normally spend long periods indoors and they tend to live in poor quality accommodation which is difficult to heat. The additional fuel allowance would have made a huge difference to their quality of life.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit is welcome. It means the objective of £100 per month for child benefit, which the Government signed up to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will now be met within the lifetime of the programme. Child benefit is an anti-poverty tool and it should remain that. As a nation with one of the worst rates of child poverty in both the EU and the OECD, it is not acceptable to distort the perks of child benefit in an effort to get the Government off the hook. Other issues relating to crèche facilities have not been addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement this evening by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, about the radon remediation grant. I have been looking for this in an alternative life for a number of years and I am pleased to welcome it. However, it is long overdue and the amount being set aside is small.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring mentioned the health services and waiting lists. Any of us will be able to confirm that the orthodontic lists and the lists for speech and occupational therapists are appalling. Not a day goes by but each of us must address the need of many of our constituents for one or other of these services.</P>
    <P>The quality of life aspects of the budget have been seriously neglected. Little has been done to improve the standard and quality of life for those most in need. The budget helps the rich to get richer. It has been clearly identified by independent analysts over the weekend that those at the lower end of the scale continue to do least well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. However, it has missed an opportunity to tackle the inequalities in our society. The benchmark by which any budget should be evaluated or judged is whether we create a fair society and reach out to those who are excluded or marginalised or who are less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use introducing a budget which means someone like myself is £50 per week better off, while my father who worked for 41 years in Westmeath County Council for a miserable wage is £10 per week better off in gross terms. Inflation at 7% will eat into that and the small pension increase he got this year. He is £2.50 better off in net terms. Why should I be 25 times better off than my parents who contributed to this society? They are no different from other parents. We should not look after the well off. We should <Col N="114" /> ensure they pay more so that people at the bottom of the ladder are looked after better.</P>
    <P>What did the budget do for the carers in society who provide 24 hour care for their fathers, mothers and other relatives? It is important to look after people in their own homes rather than put them into institutional care. Carers are with them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Minister had a glorious opportunity to reach out to those people. However, he insulted them. He increased the income disregard to £250 for a married couple and £150 for a single person. It was a pathetic gesture which means that approximately 5,000 people will be added to the 15,000 already receiving the carer's allowance. Some 20,000 people will be looked after following this budget, even though the Minister had billions of pounds to spend. There are 100,000 people caring for relatives in their own homes with very little respite care. These people were insulted and given a Harvey Smith gesture. The allowance works out at a miserable 65p per hour for the 20,000 people who receive it, that is, one-eighth of the minimum wage. How can this budget be trumpeted as fair?</P>
    <P>Caring is a universal experience. We have all been cared for and will be carers at some point. I am not ashamed to champion the cause of these people. I am aware from family experience of the care they provide. This measure is an indictment of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs at a time when the Government was looking for ways in which to spend money. Those who are most deserving were deserted in the budget. What about personal assistants in the centres for independent living such as Kinnegad? They tried to get FÁS workers but they needed full-time personal assistants at a cost of approximately £10,000. The centre for independent living made a communal budget submission seeking approximately £10,000 for personal assistants. They did not get a penny. These people have been forgotten. Money should be provided for people who are marginalised and work hard for society.</P>
    <P>What about housing? There are approximately 8,000 homeless people sleeping on the streets tonight and we feel smug and happy. Is that not a sad indictment of the well trumpeted Celtic tiger and budget surpluses. If there is money in the fund, we should use it to introduce a crash programme. Deputy Reynolds said the other night that more could have been done. I am pleased that a fellow midlander knows exactly what it is like. We should be ashamed that people are lying curled up in blankets on the streets of our cities and towns. There are approximately 50,000 people on the housing waiting list while there has been a start up of just 3,500 or 4,000 houses. How many of these include social housing units? The figure of 50,000 will increase because access to private housing is now beyond the reach of couples on the average industrial wage. There are 400 houses in County Westmeath which do not have water or sewerage facilities. Money should be provided for local authorities to look <Col N="115" /> after these people. Many are elderly people living in rural areas who believe they are forgotten. They have been forgotten in the rush for self-congratulations on the Celtic tiger which is a myth to most people.</P>
    <P>What about single income families who are totally unhappy and feel discriminated against? The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, did not mention individualisation in this year's budget because he could not do so. An increase in the income tax exemption limit of £1,000 is discriminatory. Many people took note of this and, even though this fact was concealed in the budget, people are not fools. I recently spoke to a mother of two children who is working in the home. Her husband is earning approximately £30,000 and they pay £100 a week rent. This woman, whose children are aged one and a half and three and a half, was pleased about the increase in child benefit but not in relation to child care. Child benefit is a measure to tackle child poverty but child care is a separate issue. The budget clearly discriminated against these people. Given that this family must pay £100 per week rent, this woman will not be able to save for a mortgage.</P>
    <P>CORI's summary of the budget coincides with my analysis. The poorest people in society were betrayed because the budget favours the better off and increases the divisions in society. The gap between the rich and the poor will be substantially widened as a result of the budget, which is a scandal. We must look after our young people. The Minister did nothing in the budget for third level education grants. Issues are being fobbed off to committees. The Minister knows what needs to be done. Students who must live on less than £40 per week are paying £60 and £70 rent. Income eligibility limits must be increased to a decent level of approximately £30,000, followed by a graduated relief. That measure would increase the grant for many people.</P>
    <P>Free primary care and access to the health service is crucial for all citizens. A member of the well off brigade can produce a cheque book and within three days have hip or cardiac surgery carried out. What about the people I know with medical cards who are on hospital waiting lists for two and a half or three years and consultants tell them they may have to wait for a further six months, while those with the wherewithal can have an operation carried out within 72 hours? This is an absolute scandal at a time of plenty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Keaveney and Brady.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wonderful thing about economic theories is that there are so many different ones from which to choose. It has been observed before that if all the economists in the world were laid end to end, they would not even reach a conclusion. While in theory the Minister for Finance has an infinite variety of options open to him, in practice he is constrained by a myriad of factors, including <Col N="116" /> many political, social and practical difficulties which commentators can simply ignore. In truth, every budget represents a pragmatic compromise between a variety of conflicting objectives. In debating the merits of the budget, the question before the House is, did the Minister get the compromise right? We are most emphatically not required to scrutinise the budget to judge its merits by reference to some unattainable ideal standard of economic theory. The Minister for Finance is in the business of directing the economy, he is not in the business of writing a thesis.</P>
    <P>I am labouring this point for a purpose. The single most fatuous criticism to be levelled at the budget is that it is inflationary. The cornerstone of the Government's drive to prevent inflation spiralling out of control is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is widely accepted that the consensus between the social partners, reflected in the series of national agreements culminating in the PPF, lies at the root of our economic prosperity. Moreover, it is also accepted that the maintenance of national consensus and the protection of the PPF should remain national priorities. Without the moderation and balance provided by the PPF, the treadmill of rising wages chasing rising prices could speed rapidly out of control.</P>
    <P>The budget is a key element in the compromise necessary to keep the PPF alive. This budget, taken as a package, is the price that a sensible Government has quite rightly paid to protect the medium and long-term prosperity of the economy. This budget is the only way to retain control of a situation where the PPF was threatened by an overheating economy. Viewed from the ivory tower, the budget may not be perfect. Viewed from the standpoint of plain common sense, the integrated package of measures in the budget looks a whole lot better than any of the alternatives and has been widely accepted by the public, based on the most positive response to it. Nothing is impossible for the man who does not have to do it himself. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has been the beneficiary of a bizarre cocktail of conflicting advice from the hurlers on the ditch. Matters are always different when one is obliged to play on the field.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that the political business of the House should be tempered by a measure of compassion. On that basis, I record my sympathy for the dilemma facing the Deputies opposite as they struggle to find some fault with the budget. The spectre of inflation had to be dug up and paraded around to see if it could raise a scare. However, a budget which protects the PPF has at its core the most practical response to inflation available.</P>

      <P>More laughably, there has even an attempt to charge the Government with throwing money at the health service. I am tempted to reply &ldquo;We are guilty as charged &ndash; and proud to be so&rdquo;. As the Minister for Health and Children has already made clear, we are targeting resources at priority areas. Are the Deputies opposite living in some parallel universe where cutbacks are the solution to waiting lists? We do not deny the existence of those waiting lists, nor do we deny that the length of time people must wait for operations is unacceptable.

      <P>I wish to deal with a number of points raised by Deputies Stanton and Spring. Deputy Stanton is concerned that we might be placing too much emphasis on encouraging people who emigrated to other countries to return here and take up positions in employment. For the record, 48,000 people who were living and working outside Ireland two years ago are now living and working here. For far too long this country felt the effects of emigration and rampant unemployment. However, things have changed dramatically and we now face a different challenge. The Government is taking positive steps to maintain economic growth and increase employment by encouraging those who were forced to leave the country at a time of economic hardship to return here to take up gainful employment. We will continue to pursue that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to investment in research and development, everyone accepts that we would like to see multinational companies anchor a greater proportion of their research in Ireland. However, we have to develop further interest in this area and we will do so through investment in research in technology in our universities, in technological institutes and in the science and technology programme. During the period <Col N="119" /> covered by the national development plan, £640 million will be invested in this area. In addition, we must attract our best and brightest and encourage them to engage in these activities. This will create a root system to anchor the operations of increasing numbers of multinational companies in Ireland in the future. We must also encourage investment in indigenous industries.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government are to be congratulated on a budget which has more than fulfilled the Government's commitment to the programme it announced on taking office in June 1997. The comprehensive nature, balance and fairness evident in the budget will ensure that its measures will continue to contribute to the economic success and well-being of all our citizens.</P>
      <P>The programme set out by the Government has a number of key economic and budgetary objectives: to manage our economy; to secure our continued prosperity as a nation; to improve our quality of life in a variety of ways; to promote a fairer society; and to effect ongoing tax reform through removing those on low incomes from the tax net. Reducing the tax burden, particularly for those on middle incomes, and increasing the incentive to work will help to reduce inflationary pressures.</P>
      <P>I have a specific interest in a number of areas, such as agriculture, the environment, taxation and child care, and I will comment on each. I come from County Meath, which has a strong farming tradition heavily concentrated in beef production. I am extremely concerned about the livelihoods of so many of my constituents who are beef producers. It seems that we had only resolved the farm gate price for beef issue with the meat plants&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to obtain a copy of the Deputy's speech. Who wrote it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which meant that farmers were recovering some measure of confidence and looking forward with the not unreasonable expectation of prosperity to come, when another foreign generated BSE crisis caused another market collapse through the erosion and withdrawal of consumer confidence, at home and abroad, in beef quality and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the BSE crisis and matters pertaining to its being debated elsewhere, I firmly hope the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues will endeavour to take all necessary measures to ensure the future of our beef trade in terms of domestic consumption, processing and exports, which form a huge percentage of our overall agricultural exports. I welcome the Minister's introduction of incentives to increase farm investment. Farmers are being treated no less favourably than other business sectors in respect of this issue, particularly in terms of the increase in the annual <Col N="120" /> capital allowance for investment in plant and machinery from 15% to 20%.</P>
    <P>The removal of the general 25% stock relief and the special 100% stock relief for certain trained young farmers for a further two years from next April will be generally welcomed by the farming community. The period allowed for re-investment of roll-over relief for capital gains tax purposes is being extended where farmland is subject to compulsory purchase for road building. This is important because the national development plan provides for vastly increased expenditure in respect of the upgrading of roads.</P>
    <P>In another way the Government is also attempting to secure the future of a modern farm industry through the provision of additional funding for the payment of a training allowance of £150 per week by Teagasc to farm apprentices and second year agricultural students while on block release courses. It sees farming as an ongoing and vital component of Irish life and these measures are further testimony of its continued commitment to the sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 600 students, full time and part time, in St. Angela's College, Sligo. The full-time courses include B.Ed in home economics and biology or religious education, BA in economic and social studies and diplomas in nursing. Part-time courses range from MA programmes to diplomas and certificates. The potential to develop other courses in home economics and related areas such as food and textiles as well as education is huge.</P>
      <P>These courses provide university education in the north-west and it is critical for the future development of the region that this issue is considered closely. Nevertheless, the Department of Education and Science only recognises the B.Ed degree. With the total transfer of nursing to the college in 2002 as well as the continued provision of other courses, recognition by the Minister of all courses and the potential for the development of future courses is imperative.</P>
      <P>Why does the Department of Education and Science continue to cap the intake to the B.Ed degree at St. Angela's? The college has an excellent reputation for the delivery of this degree course and for the quality of teachers who graduate from the programme. The degree is the professional and academic qualification designed to provide participants with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for teaching home economics, biology and religious education in the post-primary. community and post-compulsory sectors. Graduates of the college have an excellent employment record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Angela's is the only teacher education col<Col N="121" /> lege north of a line from Dublin to Galway. As such, it is a key provider of teacher education on a regional and national basis. The existing B.Ed programme also lends itself to further expansion and the development of courses in related areas. Demand for the B.Ed degree, according to first preference figures, exceeds the number of places by five to one and it attracts students from all over the country. Additionally, there is an annual application of more than 1,200 students for 25 available places. There is considerable scope for the college to build on the over-demand and for the B.Ed degree in terms of course provision and to increase intake into the programme, based on demand for places by school leavers and the shortfall of qualified teachers. The development of the college is also important to the region.</P>
    <P>This matter must be addressed immediately. The school of nursing will be transferred next year and the need for funding to develop the college is critical. The North Western Health Board and Cregg House are committed to transferring nursing education to St. Angela's. A development plan is currently being assessed. It is important that a budgetary allocation is made for the upgrading of facilities at St. Angela's.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has visited St. Angela's College. The college is linked to NUI, Galway, and has joint accreditation. The college is currently negotiating with NUI, Galway, and the institute of technology in Sligo to decide on the best way forward. Of the 600 students in St. Angela's, 100 are funded by the Department. It is also important that this matter is examined.</P>
    <P>An impressive range of courses is offered in St. Angela's. Degree courses in home economics, diploma and degree courses in nursing and masters degrees in education are available. The adult and continuing education programme includes certificate courses in services and business studies, certificate and diploma courses in health promotion, certificate and diploma courses in the psychology of counselling, certificate and diploma courses in social care, a diploma course in archaeology and higher diplomas in religious education and chaplaincy studies.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department recognises these courses and gives appropriate funding for them and for the new school of nursing which will be located in the college. St. Angela's has a long history of developing innovative education programmes to meet emerging trends and to provide access to third level education to students from all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to respond favourably to this important issue for the development and growth of the north-west and to give recognition to the role of St. Angela's College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in the House and I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to this <Col N="122" /> issue on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>St. Angela's College, Lough Gill, Sligo, is a private institution owned by the Ursuline order. It is one of two colleges recognised by my Department for providing a home economics teacher training course &ndash; St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, Blackrock, County Dublin, is the other. The course is of four years duration and leads to the award of a B.Ed degree in home ecomomics Each college has a total of 100 full-time students on this course. My Department pays an annual grant to St. Angela's to cover approved B.Ed training course expenditure not met by the college's own income.</P>
      <P>The future of these colleges was to have been considered in the context of the outcome of the review of the steering committee on the future development of higher education. The president of St. Angela's, Sr. Marianne O'Connor, was a member of the committee representing the specialist colleges.</P>
      <P>However, when the committee issued its report in June 1995, it had not completed its examination of specialist teacher requirements, that is, home economics, art, music etc., which had been part of its remit. It recommended, however, that both the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority should jointly pursue a further necessary review and analysis. In May 1996 the then Minister for Education and Science requested the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the advisory group on the supply of and demand for second level teachers with revised terms of reference, focusing <i>inter alia, </i>on the determination of specialist teacher needs outside the higher diploma in education programme. The terms of reference also sought recommendations on the required intake by subject type.</P>
      <P>As part of the work of the group a number of analyses was conducted, including a survey of graduates of the home economics colleges in 1992, 1993 and 1994. The review was concluded in June 1998 and recommended that the intake to St. Angela's and St. Catherine's colleges of education remain at the then combined level of 53 students per annum.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Perry said. I was pleased to have been of assistance to St. Angela's in the past. The Department sanctioned grant aid for the college and I attended the opening of its major extension. I was also pleased to be of assistance to Cregg House. Both institutions do tremendous work and I wish them continued success. I believe they will continue to play an integral part in the education of graduates, particularly in home economics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know Mr. Tony Paget, one of 5,000 or so homeless people on our streets, who was awarded a Just in Time award by the Irish Water Safety Council yesterday. Mr. Paget, <Col N="123" /> a 26 year old man, with Mr. Dimitrios Paraskevakis, a civil engineer from Scotland working in Dublin, regardless of personal risk to themselves, rescued a Bus Éireann driver from the freezing waters of the River Liffey last Sunday week after an accident sent his bus into the waters below Butt Bridge.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger and the Government cannot prevent such accidents. However, the Celtic tiger could end homelessness for Mr. Paget and the 5,000 people who, like him, face wind and rain in the doorways and passageways of our towns and cities tonight, 12 December, and every night. No doubt the Minister of State will say that the Government has increased the capital funding for the provision of services for homeless people from £20 million to £40 million. However, is this being done to solve the problem or just as a politically motivated hand-out? The money is spread over five years so it will be £8 million for the coming year. Regrettably the use of the money is unlikely to be scrutinised by the House as closely as it ought to be every six months or so, as will spending on BSE, and rightly so, and many other issues. The BSE crisis was given a blank cheque in the budget, highlighting the seriousness of the issue. How bad does the problem of homelessness have to become before it is allocated a blank cheque?</P>
      <P>From its 30 years' work, the Simon Community has stated that homelessness is worse now than ever. Is this not a national scandal? Is the situation not worse than any titillating revelations from the Flood or Moriarty tribunals or the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Health and Children or other sources?</P>
      <P>More people sleep rough on the streets of Dublin than in the combined cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham and Oxford. The figure for homelessness in Dublin doubled between 1996 and 1999 and now involves 2,000 adults and 1,000 children. A total of 68% of those who sleep rough in Dublin have been homeless for more than a year and 30% for more than five years. When questioned by the Simon Community, 94% of them said they would take accommodation if available. Of the 12 people who did not want it, nine said they would take it if it was safe. It comes down to the fact that no one wants to sleep rough, despite the myths or ideas put out by the Government.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's response to this situation? Hostels are important but they will not solve the problem of homelessness. We need to remove the requirement to involve the Garda, particularly in the case of minors, which leads to the criminalisation of a social tragedy. We also need a hotline for the homeless and a place which can be easily accessed for help and advice. There is a need for an advisory service for the training of the homeless so they can find accommodation and employment and rescue themselves from their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> There is a need to co-ordinate services for the homeless for which the Government has responsibility. In its pre-budget submission last year, the Green Party proposed Dideán, the Irish for shelter, as a co-ordinating body. I ask the Minister of State to take this idea on board so that every six months or so the House would scrutinise the progress being made to end homelessness once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be in the House to respond to this matter and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Tony Paget and Mr. Dimitrios Paraskevakis for their bravery in assisting to rescue the bus driver last Sunday week.</P>
      <P>The Government is totally committed to addressing the problem of homelessness and in this regard Deputy Molloy published a formal integrated strategy to tackle homelessness last May. Despite what Deputy Sargent might say, there has been a very positive reaction from the voluntary sector to the policies set out in the Government's strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is getting worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, many more people are now seeking homes. This strategy provides for an integrated response to homelessness by all the agencies involved, both statutory and voluntary. As part of the strategy, local authorities, together with health boards and voluntary bodies, are drawing up local action plans detailing how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in these areas. This work is ongoing and local authorities have been urged to complete these plans as a matter of urgency. The action plan for the Dublin area is very close to being finalised. While it will take some time to ensure that all these services are put in place, it is vital that services for homeless persons are improved in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The Government is concerned that not even one person should be homeless and forced to sleep on the streets of Dublin or anywhere else. As part of the action plans, additional facilities and accommodation will be provided for people who are forced to sleep rough. However, as it will take some time for these to be put in place, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has recently asked Dublin Corporation to urgently develop proposals to provide additional night-time service facilities which would provide people on the streets with basic shelter and food at night-time as an emergency interim measure. Dublin Corporation is anxious to provide these facilities and is currently seeking suitable premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area where there has been some improvement recently is emergency bed and <Col N="125" /> breakfast accommodation. The strategy calls for the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for anything other than short-term emergency accommodation of less than one month, particularly for families, to be phased out.</P>
    <P>At the instigation of the Department, Dublin Corporation, as a first step, has carried out inspections of all such accommodation in the past year and has entered into agreements with landlords whereby many of these facilities have been converted into shared living accommodation rather than simply bed and breakfast accommodation. The residents now have free access to come and go and they do not have to vacate their accommodation during the day. In addition, there is 24-hour management and security. While this is a move in the right direction in that it resolves some of the acute difficulties, we still have a long way to go. This will take some time as alternative sources of accommodation will need to be found.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, local authorities will need to continue to use bed and breakfast accommodation to accommodate homeless persons on an emergency basis, but the use of it will decrease as alternative accommodation becomes available. A key element of the Government's strategy is the provision of additional accommodation and a greater variety of it to cater for the varying needs of homeless persons, including homeless families. In particular, additional transitional and move-on accommodation will be provided to enable people to move out of emergency accommodation, whether in bed and breakfast accommodation or hostels, into accommodation more suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated, the Government is committed to tackling homelessness and has made substantial additional funding available to local authorities to ensure that the measures in the strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years and current funding is being increased by £6 million per annum to increase bed-night contribution rates to voluntary bodies and other support services.</P>
    <P>Output in the voluntary housing sector is being increased to a target of 4,000 units per year over the lifetime of the national development plan. It is expected that at least half these units will be provided under the capital assistance scheme which is used extensively to provide special needs housing for certain groups, particularly the homeless. In addition, the expanded local authority housing programme of 25,000 units over the four year period 2000-03 will also provide additional accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>We will see real improvements in the provision of accommodation and support services for homeless people. The Government has set out a clear framework and there is a genuine willingness all round to tackle homelessness. I hope we can count on the support of the Deputy and <Col N="126" /> Members for measures to be implemented in his local authority area and throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is not in the House as he is engaged elsewhere. The Minister is not normally conspicuous by his attendance on the Adjournment debate, but that is no reflection on the Minister of State who is taking his place and who is a regular in the House for this debate. Many Ministers do not seem to think it worth their while to reply to Adjournment debate matters pertinent to their Departments.</P>
      <P>I raise this case as I see it as a dangerous precedent. The case involves a young woman who has a baby and who was investigated by the Department, as it is entitled to do, in respect of her one-parent family allowance. Like other Members, I would not condone any attempt to obtain a payment under false pretences. When investigated, this woman admitted that a boyfriend occasionally stayed with her but that was as far as it went. However, subsequently all the services were alerted, including the rent support system she receives from the health board. That was terminated. She received a natural justice type letter indicating she was about to be more fully investigated. An allegation was made that there was proof of her cohabiting on the basis of information submitted to the local authority by way of a housing application. No such evidence could be construed as being in any way conclusive. Any couple with two addresses are entitled to make such a joint submission to the local authority in good order and completely above board, which was the case in this instance. She and her partner made an application to the local authority because she thought she was likely to be favourably considered under that heading.</P>
      <P>One of the issues that emerged in the course of this investigation, submitted to me as proof of her alleged guilt, was that the alleged boyfriend was living at the house, as could be concluded from a court case, but the reverse is the case. Because of the court proceedings there was no possible way she could have been cohabiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept fully the Department's right to investigate each case and the Minister is entitled to approve that. While people may tend to cut corners in the current circumstances of the Celtic tiger, this happened under the Minister's Administration and during his watch. It represents a serious erosion of the civil rights and liberties of a citizen of this State. Any attempt to use evidence in the way it was attempted to use it in this case is unacceptable. Notwithstanding that the Minister may say he does not have responsibility for such matters, this happened under his Administration and during his watch. He has ultimate responsibility. If he wishes to proceed in that <Col N="127" /> fashion, there will be other cases. I have seen evidence of them, whereby it will be deemed to be expedient to proceed in a fashion that does not have due regard to civil rights of the person concerned. In a country such as this that witnessed so much deprivation and poverty down the years, we should know better. The fact we have had a few years of economic boom does not give us the right to set aside basic liberties that have long since been established.</P>
    <P>Because of the Department's intrusion in this fashion and it appearing to present conclusive evidence that does not exist, this person who is the mother of a child has substantial arrears of rent, which normally she would receive by way of rent assistance from the health board. It is coming up to Christmas, which is supposed to be the time of giving, cheer, charity, compassion and thinking about one's neighbours, but this neighbour will not be thought about in that way. If the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs wants to become the Scrooge of Christmas time, so be it. It is within the Minister's power to examine this case to determine whether due process has been honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the determination of entitlement under the statutory one parent family payment scheme or entitlement under any other statutory social welfare scheme is not a function of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The position has not changed since Deputy Durkan was a Minister of State in that Department. Under the relevant legislation, these are matters for deciding officers and, in the event of an appeal, for appeals officers appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on all claimants of one parent family payment to satisfy, and continue to satisfy, the conditions for entitlement to the payment. In the case of unmarried one family parent claimants, the conditions are that a claimant must have the main care and charge of at least one child, must not be cohabiting, must not have gross earnings in excess of £230.76 per week, must satisfy a means test and must make efforts to seek maintenance from the other parent of the child.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a duty to ensure that social welfare payments are made to those claimants who are entitled to them. Likewise, there is an onus on recipients to inform the Department of any changes in their circumstances that would affect their entitlement to a social welfare payment. There is a policy in my Department of carrying out routine reviews of claims in payment to ensure that entitlement to a payment continues to exist. I am sure the Deputy will agree that this is a reasonable approach for the Department to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in the case in question is that the person concerned made an application for one parent family payment on 3 July 1997. She was <Col N="128" /> interviewed by a local officer of the Department. Following a deciding officer's decision, she was awarded maximum rate one parent family payment with effect from the date of her child's birth. The person concerned is still in receipt of one parent family payment at the rate of £92.70 per week, consisting of a maximum personal rate of £77.50 and an allowance of £15.20 in respect of one qualified child dependant. Her payment has not been stopped or suspended.</P>
    <P>During a routine review of her one family parent payment in October last, the person concerned informed a local officer of the Department that she had applied for housing to Kildare County Council jointly with the putative father of her child. This officer also collected other information which supported the suggestion that she and another person were living together as man and wife. As the Deputy is aware, cohabitation as man and wife would automatically disqualify her for one parent family payment under the conditions applicable to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The person concerned also received rent supplement up to the end of September last. The supplement was suspended from that time by the health board as it had evidence of cohabitation and concluded that she might no longer qualify for the supplement on means grounds.</P>
    <P>The continuing entitlement of the person concerned to one parent family payment is being examined in light of the evidence indicating cohabitation. The matter will be determined by a statutorily appointed deciding officer in light of all the facts and of any evidence she submits in support of her case.</P>
    <P>The question of clarifying the information available to the Department on the cohabitation issue is now a matter for the person concerned. In accordance with natural justice procedures, the Department wrote to her on 27 November last setting out the evidence available and affording her the opportunity to comment on the matter. She has not replied to date. On receipt of a response from the person concerned or on the expiry of the 21 days allowed for reply, a decision will be made on her continued entitlement to one parent family payment and she will be notified of the outcome. Her one family parent payment will continue while this review process is being completed.</P>

    <P>The plague of joy riding continues unabated in many parts of Dublin and it has escalated in recent months because of the ease with which people can access cars on the black market. Some irresponsible people, who know their cars may not pass the national car test, conveniently leave them available to be stolen or go so far as to offer a financial incentives to have them taken away. Young people are being encouraged to take the <Col N="129" /> cars and drive them without care for their safety or that of anybody else. The policy of car testing was not thought through when the NCT was introduced. The outcome is that stolen cars, freely available, are being driven recklessly and are then abandoned and burned out.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Broughan, earlier this year called for a comprehensive programme of measures to control and end car related crime. He has asked repeatedly for multi-agency task forces similar to the drugs task forces to tackle joy riding. The resources identified as being needed to fund such an initiative include better education facilities in disadvantaged areas, more youth and community centres, motor courses to encourage first time offenders away from car crime, local estate management and additional help for hard pressed gardaí.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill in April last called for the prosecution of anyone who supplies or offers to supply a vehicle to an under age driver. Car owners and dealers must act responsibly and ensure that their older vehicles are lawfully disposed of. There is also a responsibility on the motor industry, vehicle manufacturers and car retailers to ensure the safe disposal and scrappage of their products.</P>
    <P>A further stumbling block to the disposal of cars is the lack of an adequate facility for disposal. As a matter of urgency it should be ensured that all cars taken off the road are disposed of in a secure manner and in a way that will not allow access to under age, uninsured drivers. Money must also be made available to ensure young people have access to community and sports facilities so they can focus their energies on safe and productive activities. Communities that are struggling against the odds are often the immediate victims of joyriding and the disposal of burnt-out cars. This has a demoralising effect on those working to ensure a good and safe environment for their children and is most lamentable. There has to be responsibility for the communities terrorised by gangs of youths involved in this anti-social behaviour. The communities deserve protection from these activities and a hard-line approach should be taken with anyone found guilty of encouraging or allowing lawbreakers to operate but equally, facilities and supports must be made available to allow young people caught up in joyriding to refocus.</P>
    <P>In my constituency this is an ongoing problem which is made worse by the ready availability of these cars. The real victims of this anti-social behaviour are the residents, who are terrorised on a nightly basis by dangerous and irresponsible driving followed by the abandonment and burning of the cars in their neighbourhoods. There are issues of law and order, safety, community support and the environment to be considered here. I ask the Minister to take decisive action to protect the affected communities and to contain this anti-social behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Seo an ceathrú Ábhar faoi bhráid <Col N="130" /> na Dála anocht. I am standing in for the Minister who is away on Government business in Italy signing the UN convention against trans-national organised crime.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed the House on previous occasions, he has been assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1993, are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner. Deputy Upton has raised this issue on many occasions and it seems obvious that there is another factor involved in that some people may be offering inducements or incentives to take these vehicles away, which is very serious.</P>
      <P>The unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle is a criminal offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended. The legislation pertaining to the investigation of criminal damage, such as burning out cars, is defined under section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991. Furthermore, section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, provides the Garda with the powers to stop and seize vehicles they believe to be driven by under age drivers, who by reason of their age are ineligible to hold a driving licence and insurance. Any amendments to the existing body of road traffic legislation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is responsible for all road traffic legislation. The Minister is determined to see that the Garda have all the resources they need to tackle all forms of crime effectively. As the House is aware, the size of the force now exceeds 11,400, the highest level ever recorded, and the Government is on target to meet the commitment to a strength of 12,000 by the year 2002.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the Garda vote has risen by nearly 50% since 1997. During that time, the Garda fleet has increased from 1,350 to 1,900 vehicles and the existing Garda fleet is modern, well-maintained, reliable and considered adequate by the Garda authorities to meet their current needs. The Garda air support unit has also become operational in recent years and an additional helicopter is being purchased.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that the unprecedented increase in Garda resources is making a real impact. Contrary to what some people might think, the Garda authorities report that the number of incidents of car theft reported to them in the Dublin Metropolitan Region for the first ten months of the year 2000 shows a reduction of 9% when compared to the same period in 1999. The problem of joyriding has been targeted with a multi-faceted response involving a number of measures specifically aimed at reducing the incidence of joyriding. First, persons serving sentences for persistent offences related to so called joyriding offences are not granted early temporary release except in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Garda operate special foot and <Col N="131" /> mobile patrols, targeting specific areas in response to identified local requirements. All vehicles the subject of unauthorised takings are technically examined when recovered and known offenders are targeted for these offences. Each division also has a traffic unit who, outside of peak traffic hours, target incidents of joyriding and enforce the Road Traffic Acts. The Minister understands the special plain clothes patrols which concentrate on identifying cars that could be seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, are showing some success. The air support unit has also been particularly effective in this area and last year assisted in the recovery of 62 stolen vehicles, and the arrest of 226 persons.</P>
    <P>Third, the Garda is constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are in operation which have proved valuable in dealing with offenders. Fourth, the Garda and local authorities are working together in relation to estate management and are actively reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the seizure of vehicles, well over 5,000 cars without tax and insurance have been impounded by the Garda in Dublin this year to date. These vehicles are removed to compounds at Infirmary Road and to Santry <Col N="132" /> Garda Station. The issue of further storage capacity is currently being considered by the Garda.</P>
    <P>In relation to abandoned cars, the Waste Management Act, 1996, specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with the abandoned vehicles. The enforcement and implementation of these provisions is a matter for the individual local authorities. I understand that in general the local authorities that provide this service have entered into agreements with locally permitted operators to take the vehicles in question for dismantling and or recovery.</P>
    <P>The resources which this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has devoted to the crime and problems associated with so-called joyriding leave no doubt as to his commitment and the commitment of the Government in this area. Vast resources have been made available to this important crime-reducing area.</P>

      <Quest>if local authorities have completed their authorised starts for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of authorised starts under the local authority housing construction/acquis-ition programme was 3,700 in 1997, 3,700 in 1998 and 4,500 in 1999. The number of completions and acquisitions in each of those years was 3,217 in 1997, 3,290 in 1998 and 3,713 in 1999.</P>
      <P>Most of the authorised starts in each of those years would not have progressed to completions until the following year. Also, in 1997 and 1998, at the request of Dublin Corporation, my Department agreed to allow the corporation to divert funding to the equivalent level of 200 new houses in both of those years away from the housing construction programme and into a programme of regeneration of older flat complexes. In effect this reduced the corporation's main housing programme from 500 starts to 300 starts in each of those two years with a knock-on effect on the overall completion totals.</P>
      <P>It became more evident in 1999 that the local authority programme was not achieving the level of completions expected and I decided to introduce, for the first time, a four year multi-annual programme for the period 2000-03 in order to assist better forward planning by local authorities and to increase output.</P>
      <P>As part of Action on Housing the Government increased the local authority housing programme by an extra 1,000 units in each year from 2001 to 2006. This increase of 6,000 starts in the local authority housing programme means that capital funding is now committed for 41,500 starts over the national development plan period to meet existing demand more quickly. I recently notified local authorities of the allocation of 3,000 of these extra starts for the period covering the multi-annual programme up to 2003. The four year multi-annual programme will, therefore, increase from 22,000 to 25,000 housing starts. This is indicative of the Government's commitment to increasing momentum in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are aware that the necessary funding for the capital programme is in place and there is no impediment on this front. In 1997 the number of house starts allocated to local authorities was 3,500. It has now been virtually doubled with latitude given to local authorities to front load programmes as much as they want. I believe that the implementation of the multi-annual housing programme will be successful and we will achieve targeted output over the period <Col N="134" /> of the programme. I envisage that there will be well in excess of 5,000 local authority houses under construction at the end of this year &ndash; the highest level for very many years and evidence that the multi-annual programme approach is beginning to bear fruit.</P>

The convention aims to encourage public authorities to adopt policies and measures at local, regional, national and international level for protecting, managing and planning landscapes throughout Europe. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, makes improved provision for the protection of landscape. In addition, in June this year I issued for public consultation draft guidelines for planning authorities on landscape and landscape assessment and the submissions received are now being considered. My Department is examining the provisions of the convention in the light of the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the draft guidelines, with a view to submitting proposals to Government early in 2001 in relation to signature of the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not compile, on a systematic basis, information on the numbers of vacancies for professional planners or any other types <Col N="135" /> of posts in the local authorities. The most recent survey of the larger local authority planning departments, such as county councils and county borough corporations, carried out by my Department on 16 October 2000 found that there were 404 authorised posts for professional planners, 103 of which were vacant at that time. The 301 serving professional planners in October represents an increase of 58 on the position in March last when there was 350 authorised posts and 107 vacancies.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the management of each local authority to ensure that they have adequate staffing resources to discharge their statutory planning functions. My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional-technical and administrative-clerical staffing in order to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. While my Department has approved requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional professional planner posts, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. However, as I already indicated, an additional 58 planners were employed by the local authorities between March and October this year.</P>
    <P>Measures have been taken to increase the capacity of the planning system and the number of planners. Following the publication of Action on Housing in June this year I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues. I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September this year new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street, will treble the output of graduate planners in two years' time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. Further additional courses are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the possibility of employing planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being examined. In this regard, my Department is working with FÁS to secure planners from abroad through the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign. To this end, my Department, the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála were in attendance at the FÁS jobs fair in London on 9 and 10 December which I officially opened. As well as jobs fairs in other EU member <Col N="136" /> states and locations such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the campaign also involves the use of the FÁS Jobs Ireland website and other means to obtain planners from abroad. My Department will also pursue with the local authorities and the Local Government Computer Services Board the use of information technology to streamline planning procedures.</P>

      <P>The requirements for taxi signs are set out in the Eighth Schedule of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations. The letters TAXI must be in yellow on a dark blue background. The rear-facing section of the sign to the left of TAXI and the front facing section to its right must have a yellow background with the licence number of the vehicle and the name of the licensing authority set out in black letters. The sign must be capable of being lit by an internal light. The reason for this specification is to identify the vehicle as a public service vehicle as distinct from any other commercial or private vehicle.</P>
      <P>As an additional safeguard, the specification for a taxi sign includes the provision that the sign, when lit, may not show a red light to the front or a white light to the rear of the vehicle. This is generally in line with the requirement under lighting regulations that only white or yellow lights may show to the front of a vehicle and only red lights may show to the rear. It should be borne in mind that these lighting requirements are, strictly speaking, addressed to the front and side lamps and to rear lamps of vehicles only.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the Deputy that, due to an inadvertent error, the reply to Question No. 206 of 15 November set out this position incorrectly. It has never been represented to my Department that this specification for taxi signs poses a traffic hazard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988). Article 4 of these regulations places a duty on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that water intended for human consumption meets these standards. This duty is performed under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland and a copy of the report for 1999, which is being published today, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The OECD report correctly indicates that all water supplies do not fully comply with the stringent drinking water standards and that private group water supplies are the most problematic. The report also acknowledges that measures have been put in place, particularly under the rural water programme, to rectify the deficiencies being experienced in these supplies.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of serious concern that any supply of drinking water is deficient in quality and, accordingly, the National Development Plan 2000-06 provides for largescale investment in water services. The total provision of 3.8 billion euros investment under the plan will include a particular focus on: the provision of additional water treatment and distribution capacity; maintenance of water quality standards; water conservation and leakage reduction; and network rehabilitation. The rural water programme, addressing the needs of private supplies with water quality problems, will receive £420 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several initiatives are in place to enable rural water problems to be tackled in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. New technologies for water treatment have been successfully tested and will be given widespread application. The federation, with the backing of my Department, is introducing a quality assurance scheme for the group water sector. Following a pilot project on source monitoring in 1999-2000 a new national source monitoring pro<Col N="138" /> gramme commenced in August this year and will run for a 12 month period. The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee is in place to advise on policy in this sector. This committee is currently examining proposals for a pilot source protection scheme, to commence early in 2001. I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken to rectify deficiencies in our water supplies as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and other concerned parties with a view to the development of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end of life vehicles. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on end of life vehicles. This directive entered into force on 21 October 2000 and member states must implement its requirements by April 2002.</P>
      <P>The directive incorporates a number of significant requirements, including measures aimed at: ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs; ensuring that all collected ELVs are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution; preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components; and minimising the use of hazardous materials/substances in vehicles.</P>
      <P>My Department, following consultation with interested parties and formal adoption of the directive in October 2000, recently responded to an initial SIMI proposal for an ELV management system for Ireland, and will seek early discussions with the society and other concerned parties, to progress the development of a practicable industry led scheme. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme and to give effect to Directive 2000/53/EC as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 28 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts by my Department with local authorities it is estimated that needs have increased over the past year by around 15%.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Focus Ireland recently published figures on needs which it obtained from individual local authorities. However, some of these figures represent the number of applicants rather than the assessed needs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the NESF recommendation on waiting lists it is incorrect to suggest that it recommended a 70% reduction in waiting lists over two years. The NESF recommended that 70% of households assessed as being in need of housing should be housed within two years of going on to the waiting lists and that a longer-term target should be fixed for the elimination of all waiting lists. Information available from the 1999 assessment of housing need indicates that two-thirds of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years and it is the case that a significant number of households on waiting lists are housed within two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is addressing the increased <Col N="140" /> need for local authority housing in every way that is open to it. Capital funding for the local authority housing programme will increase by 44% next year following an increase of 36% this year. Overall funding provided for the local authority housing programme at almost £450 million will have more than doubled since this Government came into office in 1997 and the overall provision for local authority and social housing will have trebled.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a range of measures to assist local authorities to expand their housing programmes and to expand overall social housing output. This has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000-3. I have also considerably expanded the voluntary housing programme. This year, expected output from the voluntary side is likely to be around 1,000 houses and most of these are allocated to persons on the waiting list. In addition, as part of the Government's Action on Housing the Government decided to increase the number of local authority housing units by an extra 1,000 units in each year from 2001 to 2006. I notified local authorities recently of the allocation of 3,000 of these extra units for the period covering the multi-annual programme up to 2003. The four year multi-annual programme will, therefore, increase from 22,000 to 25,000 housing units. By way of contrast, in the early 1990s local authority housing output was averaging about 1,000 units per annum. I have also encouraged local authorities to front load their programmes as much as possible to meet the increased level of need. In effect this allows local authorities to commence as many local authority housing projects as they can at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was 3,713, compared to 3,290 in 1998. I expect that completions including acquisitions for the year 2000 will be in excess of last year's level and possibly up to 4,000 units. I estimate that the overall number of houses commenced this year will be 5,000 units, the highest figure for many years.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. The local authority housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 10,000 households to be met this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households. This level of social housing output will impact positively on the number of householders on waiting lists.</P>

      <P>The definition of housing authority is set out in section 23 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992. There are 88 main housing authorities comprised of 29 county councils, five county borough corporations, five borough corporations and 49 urban district councils.</P>
      <P> There are 26 town commissioners who are also housing authorities but carry out a limited range of functions. The majority of housing functions within towns having commissioners are carried out by the council of the county in which such towns are situated.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the conservation grants scheme for protected structures which I launched last year. The statutory basis for this scheme of grants is contained under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. A total of £4.125 million was allocated for conservation grants in 2000. The amount allocated to each local authority is set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>The position on legal actions and complaints being investigated by the European Commission in regard to environmental matters, which fall within the remit of my Department, is as follows.</P>
      <P>There are two cases currently before the European Court of Justice. The first concerns the making of waste management plans. Ireland has submitted its defence and requested an oral hearing in this case, and the response of the European Court is awaited in this regard. In the second case court proceedings have been initiated in relation to statutory obligations primarily on certain private rural water supplies. Ireland is required to, and will, lodge a defence by 18 December 2000.</P>
      <P>Current reasoned opinions under Article 226 of the Treaty concern the establishment of water quality standards for certain dangerous substances and the safe disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls. Water quality standards for phosphorus were made in July 1998. Draft regulations for water quality standards for a range of other dangerous substances are being finalised and will be made early in 2001. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to address the safe disposal of PCB/PCT in the proposed national hazardous waste management plan.</P>
      <P>A further 15 complaints are at a preliminary stage of investigation and another 21 are the subject of correspondence with the Commission. Details of these are set out in the following tables which will also be sent to the Deputy and circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 29 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>My Department will be issuing the guidelines on the implementation of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the accompanying model housing strategy to planning authorities later this week.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities are now required to prepare their housing strategies under Part V by 1 August next. I have urged them to complete this process ahead of this so that they can operate the social and affordable housing provisions as soon as possible. Based on available information it appears that, in general, county councils and county boroughs are at the early stages in the preparation of their strategies. In Dublin, where the affordability issue is most pressing, the four authorities have been working together over the past few months on the preparation of their strategies. This work is at an advanced stage and it is expected that the draft strategies will be submitted to the respective councils early next year for consideration. I will ask county and city managers to report to my Department by the end of January next setting out the position in relation to the preparation of the housing strategy for their area at that time, and specifically when it is proposed to complete the draft strategy and the procedures to vary the development plan to incorporate the strategy.</P>
      <P>I commenced Part IX of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which contains the provisions in relation to strategic development zones, with effect from 1 November. As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 141 and 276 of 8 November 2000, I gave approval at the end of October to a more detailed analysis by local authorities of 11 of the 25 sites put forward by them as potential strategic development zones for residential development under Part IX of the Act. Submissions have been received in relation to each of the sites and an assessment of these submissions is currently being finalised by my Department. I expect on this basis to be in a position to designate the first tranche of strategic development zones in January.</P>

      <P>The primary aim of the town renewal scheme is to restore, consolidate and improve the existing built fabric of towns. The guidelines which issued to county councils to assist in the preparation to town renewal plans stated that:</P>
      <P>plans should not normally provide for the demolition of existing buildings that are structurally sound. By the nature of the scheme, demolition and rebuilding will not qualify for incentives where refurbishment of existing structures would have been possible.</P>
      <P>Given that the town renewal plan submitted by Sligo County Council for Bellaghy-Charlestown sought new build incentives only for this site and the proposed development would have led to the demolition of existing buildings, no incentives were awarded. The expert panel considered that refurbishment would be more appropriate for this site. The county council did not apply for this in the town renewal plan submitted.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the town renewal scheme, as provided for in the guidelines and the Town Renewal Act, 2000, the expert panel were confined to considering recommendations on incentives made by the county council only. Therefore, it was not open to the panel to award refurbishment incentives in this case as these had not been sought by the council.</P>
      <P>The panel exercised an independent role in the assessment of the plans submitted, their recommendations were accepted in full and this was the basis on which designations under the scheme were announced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 32, 35, 38, 59 and 309 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to implementing the new taxi regime set out in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, and in accompanying policy measures which I have also announced. This position has been made clear in discussions with taxi representative groups which have so far been held on 28 November, 7 December and 8 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to this, it has also been explained to taxi representatives that the Government is anxious to progress a number of mitigating <Col N="149" /> measures, involving a proposed tax relief for actual capital loss in the value of a licence by reference to the actual sum paid for the licence, and an administrative scheme to address high licensing fees paid to certain local authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to this tax relief, the Minister for Finance has separately stated his willingness to consider hardship cases in the context of the provisions to be incorporated in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>A joint statement of the first set of discussions with taxi representative groups on 28 November is available in the Oireachtas Library. This also makes clear my willingness to work with taxi service providers, and others, to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium-term. Additionally, both sides are committed to continuing the process of dialogue and this is being taken forward.</P>
    <P>I stated in announcing the new measures that it was desirable to ensure that new applications for taxi licences were bona fide for the purpose of providing public service. The £5,000 initial fee for the grant of a taxi licence is, <i>inter alia</i>, designed to support this requirement. More frequent and systematic testing of taxi vehicles will also encourage higher standards and investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements recognise the continuing need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis. Measures in support of this involve a considerably lower level of licensing fees applicable to wheelchair accessible taxi licences and the commitment that, by the end of 2003, the process will commence of making all taxis wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>The granting of taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences continues to be the responsibility of individual local licensing authorities to whom applications for taxi licences are made and detailed information regarding the numbers of recent taxi licence applications or of taxi licences issued would be available from such authorities. I understand that strong interest in obtaining new taxi licences is being demonstrated in the main taximeter areas in the country. I am advised that by early this week at least 1,750 conditional offers of new taxi licences and some 60 new licences had been issued by local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan sets out a strategic framework <Col N="150" /> for the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006 and provides for a total investment of approximately £21 billion, 1999 prices, for such development. The NDP has been further elaborated in the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme and in the Operational Programmes for the Border, Midlands and Western and the Southern and Eastern Regions, which have recently been approved by the European Commission. Of the total planned investment, approximately £15.7 billion is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including: national roads &ndash; £4.7 billion; non-national roads &ndash; £1.6 billion; water and waste water &ndash; £2.9 billion; housing &ndash; £6.0 billion; waste management &ndash; £0.65 billion; and urban and village development &ndash; £0.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Work is now well under way in my Department, local authorities and the National Roads Authority on the detailed programming of the work required and in the planning, design and implementation of individual infrastructure projects. Expenditure on these programmes in 2000 will amount to £1.791 billion, which is in line with NDP targets.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of improved infrastructure throughout the country. As part of the effort, a broad ranging package of measures is being pursued under the direction of the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure Development to support the process of implementation. These include the promotion of public private partnerships, new procedures for improved management of projects, improved arrangements for dealing with archaeological requirement, a communications strategy at home and abroad to gain maximum support for the programme of investment, measures to increase the capacity of the construction industry, and the transfer of certain project approval functions to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a good start has already been made and that progress will continue towards achieving the ambitious objectives set out in the national development plan.</P>

      <P>Cork County Council has been allocated non-national road grants of £23.295 million in 2000 compared to initial allocations of £21.746 million in 1999 and £15.8 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>It is responsible, out of the above funding in addition to its own resources, for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and bridges in its area.</P>
      <P>In principle, the very considerable funds available to local authorities for non-national road maintenance and improvement are designed to cover contingencies arising from flooding, storm damage and other severe weather conditions. My Department's Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads provides that the cost of such remedial works must be met from these resources and that local authorities should set aside contingency sums to finance such works. Local authorities are reminded of this requirement each year.</P>
      <P>My Department will consider sympathetically any request from a county council to adjust their current multi-annual restoration programme so as to prioritise works necessitated by flood damage to particular roads.</P>
      <P>I will announce the 2001 non-national road grant allocations early next year and significant funding will be again provided to local authorities to assist in further improving the non-national road network.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is <Col N="153" /> however more complex than for alcohol. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</P>
    <P>In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, my Department has pledged additional funding, of which some £100,000 has so far been allocated, to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to carry out a two year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens.</P>
    <P>The preliminary findings of this programme were made available earlier this year by the MBRS. These findings are based on blood and urine samples submitted to the MBRS between 1 July and 31 December 1999 which proved to be under the legal limit for alcohol. Within this sub-set of blood and urine samples, further MBRS analysis screened some 37% as being positive for drugs, the most common being cannabis.</P>
    <P>These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the road safety strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I must stress that under existing legislation it is already illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy on child care is to increase the number of child care places available and to improve the quality of child care services for the community. I published draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities for public <Col N="154" /> consultation in May of this year. The consultation period has now elapsed and the submissions received are being considered with a view to publishing final guidelines as soon as possible. The draft guidelines explicitly acknowledged that planning permission for child care facilities had been identified as an area of concern in relation to child care service development. The draft guidelines are intended to address this concern by ensuring a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities and to identify the planning issues appropriate to such facilities.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans and will also be of interest to developers, builders and child care service providers. The guidelines will also assist the planning authorities in fulfilling the requirement under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, that the provision of services for the community, including crèches and other child care facilities must be included as an objective in development plans. In view of the importance of the issue, when issuing the draft guidelines, I asked planning authorities to take them on board straight away. The final guidelines to be issued early in the new year as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which came into operation on 1 November 2000.</P>
    <P>In considering individual applications for planning permission, planning authorities are restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area, regard being had to the provisions of the development plan and ministerial guidelines. In individual cases, depending on factors such as location and traffic conditions, planning considerations may give rise to the attaching of conditions limiting the number of children to be accommodated in a crèche at a level below that approved by the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development. Some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing. In addition to the three pilot national roads projects already identified in the <Col N="155" /> plan, the National Roads Authority has announced a further eight PPP schemes for the national road network. These new schemes, together with the pilot projects, will involve total estimated investment of over £1,000 million, with a potential private finance input of some £700 million based on user tolls.</P>
      <P>User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>
      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. The exercise of these powers has been subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Following commencement of the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, ministerial approval will no longer be required for toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters are being brought within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively.</P>
      <P>In parallel, under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Roads Act, 1993, has been amended to provide for the issue of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions, with which they will be obliged to comply. Any such policy directives may not relate to particular tolling schemes and would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The average size of local authority hous<Col N="156" /> ing projects has increased from around eight to nine houses in 1999 to some 12 houses this year. I consider that there is scope for further increasing the size of schemes without loss of design, quality or amenity and avoiding an excessive concentration of rented local authority housing. In particular, different household tenures as between affordable, voluntary and local authority rented houses can now be more readily accommodated within larger schemes. I also believe that larger schemes are likely to attract a greater level of interest from building contractors in tendering for local authority schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department has now written to local authorities requesting that they consider increasing project sizes and that restrictions set in 1992 on the size of local authority housing projects no longer apply. The limits were set following a period when local authority housing output averaged around 1,000 per year.</P>
      <P>I am aware of capacity constraints in the building industry which are impacting on the delivery of the social housing programme, including local authority housing. The final report of the Forum for the Construction Industry on Expanding the Capacity of the Construction Industry was published in October. An interdepartmental group, led by my Department, is now finalising an action plan to increase the overall capacity of the construction industry, including the housing sector, drawing on the forum's recommendations. This action plan will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine the level of expenditure on individual local services as part of its annual estimates process. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources, including the Local Government Fund, rates, fees and charges. Local authorities may use these general sources of funding, <i>inter alia</i>, to intensify enforcement of the litter laws, including in tourist areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, since 1997 I have allocated a total of almost £1.4 million to local authorities for public education and awareness initiatives against litter. My Department also provides financial support for the An Taisce led project, national spring clean, aimed at raising public awareness and participation in local anti-litter clean-ups and awareness actions to improve the local environment; the project, which provides a key role for local authorities, has been run for the past two years and will run again in 2001. Total Exchequer funding for anti-litter measures in 2001 will be <Col N="158" /> £950,000, an increase of nearly 19% on the 2000 provision.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, primary responsibility for the development and implementation of management and enforcement responses to deal with the litter problem rests with local authorities under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming to office, I have commissioned three reports on the housing market from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, each of which contained evidence of strong investment demand for residential properties. The most recent report, The Housing Market in Ireland: an Economic Evaluation of Trends and Prospects, published in June 2000 identified continuing strong investment demand for residential properties and also referred to evidence that investor activity was pricing first-time purchasers out of the market, particularly at the lower price range.</P>
      <P>In June last the Government introduced a wide range of measures in Action on Housing to address these and other housing issues. Government strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time purchasers. It is too early at this stage to assess the full impact of the measures taken in Action on Housing, but the indications to date are positive. House price increases are moderating, housing output has increased and first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market, which may be attributed to reduced investor activity in response to the measures introduced in Action on Housing and to increases in housing output at the lower end of the market.</P>
      <P>In their recently issued annual property survey for 2000, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute indicated that average rent increases were 14% nationally in the year to November 2000, compared with a figure of 13% nationally in the year up to November 1999. This could not be regarded as a sharp increase in rents. They also referred to a significant projected increase in rents, to which the Deputy may be referring, but this relates to rental properties in premium locations in Dublin and not the wider private rented residential market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government aims to develop a thriving, diverse and well managed private rented sector. In addition to measures designed to increase the overall supply of housing, actions taken in recent years include specific incentives for the provision of rented residential accommodation in urban renewal areas and for the provision of student accommodation. This Government has also improved the position of tenants in the private rented residential sector by increasing the ceilings for income tax relief, in the past two budgets. The ceiling for income tax relief in respect of rent paid by tenants under 55 has doubled. In the case of tenants over 55 a doubling of the ceiling, coupled with standard rating of the relief means that 80% of such tenants gain a doubling of relief. A rent-a-<Col N="160" /> room scheme was announced in the recent budget which provides for an exemption from income tax in respect of gross rental income of up to £6,000 per annum, for accommodation provided in a person's principal private residence. This measure will facilitate the provision of accommodation thereby easing the pressure on the private rented sector and will improve the utilisation of the housing stock.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission on the private rented residential sector, published in July of this year, identified a growing need for accommodation in the private rented sector and set out a number of recommendations to increase supply, including recommendations aimed at increasing long-term investment in private rented accommodation. The Government is considering its response to the report of the commission.</P>

In further support of the more sustainable use of sewage sludge in agriculture, which is the objective of the directive, I have had prepared a code of good practice for the use of biosolids in agriculture and a guidance document for the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities. These authorities are now in the process of preparing individual sludge management plans, with the assistance of funding from my Department. Correspondence has been received from the European Commission relating to some technical issues in regard to the transposition of the directive. My Department is preparing a response.</P>

      <P>There is a range of accommodation provided by local authorities and voluntary bodies <Col N="161" /> for homeless people. Hostel accommodation, which is the main source of emergency accommodation for homeless persons, includes long-term, transitional or medium-term accommodation where, in many instances, people can remain during the day and avail of meals and laundry facilities. Overnight emergency accommodation is usually vacated every day, although in some cases the same persons might come back nightly. In addition to the availability of hostel accommodation, bed and breakfast accommodation is also used to accommodate homeless people, where necessary. In some cases, health care and welfare services are also provided to homeless persons.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for asylum seekers is procured by the directorate for asylum support services in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The provision of accommodation for homeless persons and asylum seekers is not directly comparable as asylum seekers are provided with accommodation on arrival in the country on a dispersal basis at various locations throughout the country. The Government's integrated strategy on homelessness has identified a need for the provision of more accommodation and of a wider range of accommodation for homeless persons. I expect that local authority action plans for homeless services will set out the range and amount of additional accommodation to be provided over the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming to office, I have commissioned three major reports on the housing market with a particular focus on the supply and demand for housing and the affordability of housing. The Government has responded positively to the findings of these reports in Action on House Prices, published in April 1998, Action on the Housing Market, published in March 1999, and earlier this year in Action on Housing.</P>
      <P>Government strategy, which is proving effective, is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers.</P>
      <P>Total housing output last year was over 46,500, an increase of 20% over 1997, and output is expected to reach 50,000 units this year, a 29% increase on output in 1997.</P>
      <P>House price data for recent months indicate further moderation in the rate of increase in average house prices. There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market. These trends may be attributed to reduced investor activity in response to measures introduced in Action on Housing and the sustained increases in housing output.</P>
      <P>The provision of £6 billion for social and affordable housing in the national development plan, augmented by further investment of almost £1 billion announced in Action on Housing, will ensure that the social and affordable housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies to address the housing needs of all sectors of the community, including those in need of social and affordable housing. This requires local authorities to make an assessment of current and projected needs for housing in their areas, to prepare housing strategies and vary their development plans to incorporate the strategies. Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies, together with a model housing strategy will be published shortly. These, together with earlier measures, provide a comprehensive and coherent response to housing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety whose first progress report published in July 1999 and second progress report published in August 2000 detail progress with key actions. Copies of both reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made in the first two years of the strategy period in relation to its primary targets. By end 1999, road deaths had been reduced by nearly 13% relative to 1997 and serious injuries from road accidents had been reduced by over 15%. Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with nearly 300 schemes now likely to be completed by the end 2000. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for the reduction of speeding and an increase in seat belt wearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the Road <Col N="165" /> Safety Strategy. Over 175,000 on-the-spot fines issues in relation to speeding offences in 1999, and more than 160,000 up to mid-September this year. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. Nearly 70,000 on-the-spot fines have been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. Evidential breath testing is being progressively introduced in relation to drink driving enforcement.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy envisages a penalty points system as a key measure in support of road safety enforcement. The Government approved the drafting of legislation necessary for this measure on 26 July 2000. The design of the system has, as stated in the strategy, required careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. The Bill will also provide for some elements of random breath testing and the further refinement of the legal framework for the detection and processing of offences. The drafting of the Bill is now proceeding as a matter of urgency with a view to its publication as early as possible in the new year.</P>

      <P>Current and proposed regional waste management plans aim to achieve the ambitious waste recovery targets specified in the policy statement changing our ways. Over the period ahead, my Department will be providing practical support and assistance to local authorities as they address the delivery of the services and infrastructure provided for in these plans.</P>
      <P>The national development plan anticipates £650 million of capital investment in waste management in the period to 2006, and operational costs may also be expected to increase significantly.</P>
      <P>Major infrastructural requirements can best be addressed through the establishment of public private partnerships delivering integrated regional solutions. Additionally, local authorities will provide or arrange for the provision of, supporting waste recovery infrastructure, as well as segregation at source and separate collection of recyclable and organic materials for waste recovery purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> Changing our ways places a strong emphasis on the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle in financing the provision of waste services by or on behalf of local authorities. Within each region, it is essential that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services that they provide by means of use related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial/ business concerns.</P>
    <P>Within this overall context, EU/Exchequer support of £100 million will be available under the NDP, through the regional operational programmes for the period to 2006 in respect of the provision of waste recovery infrastructure. It is envisaged that financial support will be made available towards planning/procurement costs associated with the delivery of major regional infrastructure and the capital cost of recycling infrastructure, for instance, civic amenity sites and materials recovery facilities, provided for in regional and local plans.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming policy statement on waste prevention and recovery will outline a range of measures that will be undertaken to minimise waste generation and ensure a sustained expansion in national recycling performance.</P>
    <P>Overall, local authorities generally will receive a significant level of financial assistance and support in their implementation of the waste recovery and recycling objectives of the waste management plans currently being adopted.</P>

      <P>Since 1976, all new local authority housing has been built with wall cavity, attic and floor insulation. The standards of insulation required have been progressively improved in 1982, 1991 and, most recently, following the 1997 revision of the building regulations.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have figures concerning the number of pre-1976 local authority houses remaining in the local authority stock as many of these houses would have been sold to tenants under the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department financially assists local authorities in upgrading, renovating and redeveloping their housing stock through the remedial works scheme and funding for regeneration and redevelopment projects. Works under the remedial works scheme must comply with the building regulations. The extent of works carried out to dwellings varies from project to project. Where an extensive programme of refurbishment works is carried out, measures are taken to improve thermal insulation in accordance with the building regulations. Some 14,500 dwellings have been refurbished since the inception of the scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department also funds local authority redevelopment of certain flat complexes in urban areas involving some new build, refurbishment of some flats where this is considered feasible, and the demolition of other flats and their replacement with new housing. All these works would comply with the current building regulations; including the requirement for improved insulation.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, wrote to me in June 2000 suggesting that an amendment to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, should be included in the then Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which was about to be discussed on Report Stage in the Dáil. The amendment proposed was to introduce new controls on greenhouse gas emissions in the integrated pollution control licensing system. I indicated in my reply that it would be inappropriate to include such an important environmental amendment at that late stage in the planning Bill, as it would have delayed the passage of the Bill, and that I intended to address this issue in an integrated manner in the context of amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made on the mandate given by the Government to my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy which will translate the overall approach to regional development contained in the national development plan into a more detailed framework for spatial development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>On foot of that mandate, my Department established a spatial planning unit to manage the preparation of the strategy. An interdepartmental steering committee, with representation from all relevant departments, established to oversee the development of the strategy at policy level, has met on a number of occasions. The interdepartmental committee is supported by a technical working group and sub-groups to facilitate a co-ordinated input to the preparation of the strategy from departments, State agencies, regional assemblies and other bodies whose policies, functions or operations are relevant to achieving the objective of more balanced regional development. In addition, I have established an expert advisory group which provides a vehicle for my Department to avail of the advice of leading national and international figures in the area of spatial development and planning.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy is being prepared in four stages. The first stage of the process was completed in May 2000 with the publication of a report entitled, The National Spatial Strategy &ndash; Scope and Delivery. This report sets out the background to the strategy, identifies its objectives and the challenges it faces to achieve those objectives, gives details of the work to be carried out during each stage of the process of preparing the strategy, sets out the organisational structures which have been put in place and the arrangements which have been made for the participation of relevant interests and the public generally in the process. A copy of this report has been circulated to all Members of the House.</P>
      <P>Stage two of the process of preparing the strategy, which has just been completed, required extensive research into the spatial structure and functioning of Ireland under a number of different headings. External consultants have assisted with a number of these research projects. This research includes in-depth analysis into such areas as population and labour force projections and future housing demand broken down on a regionalised basis, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, enterprise development, quality of life issues, transport infrastructure, energy, educational access, environmental protection and availability of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research and analysis phase of preparing the strategy is being followed by the preparation of policy option papers which will be the subject <Col N="171" /> of a broad based consultative process during the first half of next year. The final stage during the latter half of next year will see the drawing together and reconciliation of the emerging strands of policy and drafting of the strategy itself, including the proposals for the future functioning of urban areas of different sizes, with a view to publication of the strategy by the end of 2001.</P>

      <P>The expert panel on town renewal recommended that incentives be refused for the properties referred to by the Deputy as they were in the view of the panel capable of being developed without the aid of incentives given their central position in the town. To award incentives in these cases would constitute deadweight, that is, support for development likely to proceed without the aid of tax incentives. The guidelines for the scheme required that scarce public resources must be targeted at areas of greatest need and potential and incentives could only be justified where it could be shown that they would assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to desired development. The guidelines also required that the selection process should also address issues such as deadweight. To have awarded incentives in this case would have been contrary to the objectives of the scheme and hence, the panel did not recommend these sites for incentives.</P>
      <P>The role of the expert panel was to assess the county councils proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by county councils. The panel exercised an independent role in assessing the various plans submitted, their recommendations were accepted in full and this formed the basis on which the designations were announced.</P>

      <Quest> the way in which it is proposed to make employers aware of the opinion of the Registrar of the Courts and of the Office of the Attorney General that guaranteed gratuities can be considered as part of an employees basic hourly minimum wage; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The schedule to the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, specifies the reckonable and non-reckonable pay components in calculating an employee's average hourly rate of pay in a specific pay reference period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers arose in the context of the Hotels Employment Regulation Order, Statutory Instrument No. 283 of 1999, which has a reference to guaranteed gratuities. In the course of drawing up proposals for a new employment regulation order, the chairman of the hotels joint labour committee, which has representatives on it from the Irish Hotels' Federation, IBEC and SIPTU, sought legal advice as to whether guaranteed gratuities were a reckonable or non-reckonable pay component under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. Legal advice from the Registrar of the Labour Court and the <Col N="177" /> Office of the Attorney General was that guaranteed gratuities come within reckonable pay components under part 1 of the Schedule to the Act. The hotels joint labour committee subsequently published reformulated proposals on the 10 November 2000.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Court makes a new employment regulation order, it is widely distributed to employers covered by the order and an advertisement is also placed in newspapers advising that an order has been made. Thus employers are made aware of their legal obligation under an employment regulation order.</P>
    <P>Staff of the employment rights information unit of my Department deal with inquiries from, and offer information to the public on the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. Where the information offered by the staff of the unit relates to the interpretation of guaranteed gratuities such information is given in accordance with the legal advice received. Labour inspectors, in their enforcement activity of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, also operate in accordance with this advice.</P>

      <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> carried an article in its edition of 12 November which reported that the safety study commissioned by the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission &ldquo;Had found rail standards in the country to be safer than those in the UK&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the contents of the report by Sedgewick Wharf who were the safety consultants appointed. I am, however, satisfied that the report has been treated in confidence by the small number of people in the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission who have seen it.</P>
    <P>I expect that the report of Sedgewick Wharf will be made available to both the management and unions involved in this case shortly, when the Labour Court and LRC issues the findings of their joint investigation.</P>

      <P>As of 30 November 2000 my Department had received 756 FOI requests. Of these requests 743 had been dealt with at that date, with 13 being transferred to other Departments and 165 withdrawn or dealt with outside FOI. A decision was taken to grant the request for access in 137 cases, to part-grant in 188 cases and to refuse the request for access, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, in 240 cases. It should be noted that of those requests refused, 67 were refused on the grounds that they were frivolous and vexatious and pertained to an individual who had made 196 requests to my Department.</P>
      <P>The treatment of FOI requests is constantly monitored by the FOI unit of my Department, which, like other areas of the Department reports to management in the normal course of business. The FOI unit also inputs to the FOI central policy unit of the Department of Finance which reports on FOI implementation measures to the Oireachtas on a yearly basis, in accordance with section 15(6) of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. I am satisfied that FOI requests are dealt with expeditiously by my Department. Apart from the individuals referred to earlier, who submitted 31 appeals, only five appeals involving my Department have been referred to the office of the Information Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The manning requirements and qualifications for officers serving on Irish fishing vessels are contained in the Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 289 of 1988) as amended by the Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 192 of 2000). These requirements and qualifications are broadly in line with the International Maritime Organisation's STCW(F) (Standards of Training, <Col N="180" /> Certification and Watchkeeping) Fishing Convention, 1995.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the marine survey office of my Department is responsible for the examination and certification of seafarers, including those in the fishing sector, in Ireland. It would be essential that any non-EU national seeking employment as an officer on an Irish fishing vessel would have to satisfy the marine survey office that their qualifications are in line with the STCW(F) convention before they can be recognised or certified by my Department.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to ratings is that while under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Fishing Vessels) Regulations, 1999, introduced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, there is a duty on the part of employers to provide training for their workers, as specified in the regulations, this training does not require to be certificated. As I have already indicated in my Parliamentary Question reply of 7 December, I have directed that discussions occur immediately in relation to the question of the introduction of mandatory certificated safety training for fishermen, especially new entrants, and in this context the position regarding non-EU nationals being recruited as ratings on Irish fishing vessels is to be considered.</P>

      <P>The ice plant at Bunbeg, owned by BIM, was installed in 1992 and leased, on a commercial basis, to the local fishermen's association. I understand from BIM that that production has been minimal as requirements for ice from the facility have been at such a low level since its installation.</P>
      <P>Operating the plant at such low production levels has made the cost of producing ice prohibitive and is an unreasonable burden on the resources of the fishermen's association as the lessee. Given the operational costs and overheads, it is not economically viable for either the local fishermen or for BIM to operate the Bunbeg plant.</P>
      <P>BIM's decision to remove the facility from Bunbeg was notified to the fishermen, following consultation with the association. The BIM ice plant at nearby Burtonport can adequately service the relatively small demand for ice from Bunbeg fishermen.</P>

    <P>I will arrange for a definitive list of these projects to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as the local authorities provide their final reports and claims and the final expenditure figures for 2000 can be ascertained.</P>
    <P>In so far as the marine tourism and leisure programme is concerned, the savings arise for three reasons. First, the fact that the marine tourism and leisure scheme could not be finalised pending the approval by the European Commission of the regional operational programmes of the National Development Programme, 2000-2006, and a sum of £3 million. Such approval was forthcoming in November. Second, a scheme which will facilitate the provision of grant aid to mining tourism projects will not be in place until January 2001, which will cost £1.78 million approximately. Third, funding to cover the expenses and outgoings of the adventure activity standards authority could not be disbursed pending the enactment, expected next year, of the legislation establishing that body at a cost of £60,000.</P>

These include a clear separation between the judicial, legislative and executive powers, and the adoption of new civil and criminal codes as well as legislation on local self government. The Venice Commission, a specialised organ of the Council of Europe, with expertise in the field of constitutional law, continues its assistance and co-operation with the Ukrainian Parliament, the Office of the President and the Ukrainian Constitutional Court in the ongoing constitutional and legal reform process in Ukraine.</P>
    <P>In the field of press and media freedom, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly has expressed concern regarding the case of the disappearance of a Ukrainian journalist, Georgiy Gongadze.

      <P>Human rights in Algeria continue to be a serious cause of concern. In ongoing discussions with our EU partners on this issue, we have emphasised the need for a constructive dialogue with Algeria. In this context, the EU has encouraged key reforms, including modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has funded constructive assistance through the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In the dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society. The dialogue is conducted under the Barcelona Declaration of November 1995, whose aim is to lead to a strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and balanced economic and social development, measures to combat poverty and promotion of greater understanding between cultures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that Algeria's membership of the partnership can make a valuable contribution towards ending civil conflict in that country. Each partner country has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN Charter and the universal declaration of <Col N="186" /> human rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that with up to one-third of its population unemployed, and one-third under the age of 30, social and economic stability in Algeria is crucial and can, in time, provide the basis for a peaceful future for that country. The social and economic aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership clearly have an important part to play in this. The negotiations, conducted by the Commission on behalf of the EU, on an association agreement under the partnership, resumed last April. These negotiations fully reflect the human rights commitments under the Barcelona declaration.</P>
    <P>Algeria is also party to several human rights conventions, including the international conventions on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. We remain concerned to see that these commitments are fully implemented in practice.</P>
    <P>The European Union welcomed the outcome of the referendum in September of last year in which the Algerian people endorsed President Bouteflika's vision of national peace and reconciliation. The amnesty introduced by President Bouteflika was a positive step. At this stage, further steps are clearly necessary and it is essential that all groups work for the reconciliation and security of the country.</P>
    <P>Internal security has continued to be marked by killing over recent months. These outbreaks of bloodletting both violate human rights and jeopardise the programme of national reconciliation. The Government wants to see the Algerian people finally emerge from the violence they have suffered for so long. We are strongly encouraging all efforts towards the achievement of that goal.</P>

      <P>The report of the Secretary General of 4 October 2000 on the establishment of a special criminal court for Sierra Leone is still under consideration by the Security Council.</P>
      <P>This report considers, in a substantive and constructive manner, a number of the issues that Amnesty International has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We share the concern of Security Council members on the need to establish a court which is both equitable and effective in bringing to justice those responsible for the atrocities committed in <Col N="187" /> Sierra Leone. This will necessitate a balanced, practical and legal assessment of the best means of achieving this goal. As a member of the Security Council next month, Ireland will be working closely with other council members to that end.</P>
    <P>In so doing, Ireland will of course take into account pertinent recommendations of the NGO community together with the observations made and questions raised in the report of the Secretary General.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>Since the Patten report was published in September 1999, the Government has been in regular and ongoing contact with the British Government on the proposals set out therein for police reform in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In particular, we have had detailed discussions &ndash; at both ministerial and official level &ndash; on the Policing (Northern Ireland) Bill as it progressed through its various stages. As originally published, the Bill fell short of Patten's recommendations in a number of important areas. In the course of the legislative process substantial improvements were made to the Bill and it was passed into law on 23 November last.</P>
      <P>The immediate focus is the revised implementation plan which is due to be published shortly. My most recent meeting with the Secretary of State was on 5 December last when we discussed a number of key issues relating to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including policing. My officials have also had discussions with their British counterparts in recent days on the revised plan.</P>
      <P>The Government is working constructively with the parties and the British Government in trying to address outstanding concerns. As I said in the Seanad recently, we are seeking to build on the improvements that have been achieved. We also need to work to build confidence and to provide reassurance that the vision and values of the agreement and of the Patten Commission continue to lie at the heart of the policing project. That work continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of bonded labour in India is a matter of serious concern to the Government and to the international community.</P>
      <P>Bonded labour has long been recognised as a contemporary form of slavery and is forbidden by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, by the 1956 Convention on practices similar to slavery and by the International Labour Organisation.</P>
      <P>The question of bonded labour in India has been raised at a number of international organisations, in particular the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation. The working group on contemporary forms of slavery, a working group of the sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of bonded labour. At its session in Geneva in July 2000, the working group devoted priority attention to the question of bonded labour, in particular in India, and adopted a number of recommendations aimed at eliminating this practice.</P>
      <P>The ILO has been addressing bonded labour, and in particular bonded child labour, in India since 1992, through a large series of action and other programmes. The programmes are designed to raise awareness of the problem and to provide education and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to supporting efforts to eliminate this fundamental abuse of human rights and all other forms of slavery. Ireland fully supports the work under way in the UN and ILO to eliminate bonded labour and our concerns have been voiced on this matter in all relevant international fora.</P>
      <P>Ireland has provided financial assistance to the UN voluntary trust fund on contemporary forms of slavery, which was established in 1991.</P>
      <P>This trust fund assists NGOs to participate in the work of the working group on contemporary forms of slavery and to provide assistance to individual victims of contemporary forms of slavery, such as bonded labour.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work for the elimination of this unacceptable practice.</P>

      <P>The allocation of trains to particular lines is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for the purchase of additional and replacement mainline rail rolling stock over the life of the plan. Iarnród Éireann is currently undertaking a tender process for the purchase of new train sets for intercity routes. These train sets are being ordered in two equal tranches of 20. Delivery of these new carriages is expected in 2002-03.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the coming into service of 20 new diesel rail-cars for Arrow services over the coming weeks will have the effect of freeing up some Dublin outer-suburban rolling stock for use on intercity, routes particularly at weekends.</P>

      <P>No detailed discussions have taken place in relation to a gas station at Bellacorrick. Clearly with the electricity market now open to competition and due to be fully liberalised in 2005, power generators, including the ESB, will make decisions on investment in new plant based on commercial criteria. I expect that the ESB will be looking at all opportunities which arise including the potential for a new gas station in the west if the conditions are right.</P>
      <P>The ESB has recently met representatives of the North Mayo Action Group on this and other matters and I have no doubt that these contacts will continue.</P>

      <Quest>the steps she will take to ensure that the cost of bandwidth here is made more competitive in view of the fact that costs in Seattle, USA are one-twentieth of those in Ireland which places Irish companies at a serious disadvantage when trying to compete on a global basis.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications and broadband services is a matter in the first <Col N="193" /> instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. The communications market was liberalised in December of 1998 because it is my belief that through increased levels of competition that the cost of these services to the end user will come down. There are now over 60 licensed communications operators with the ODTR. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
      <P>In recent years I have put in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure and competitiveness in Ireland, both nationally and internationally.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Government entered a contract with global crossing, worth more than £77 million, to build high capacity, seamless, telecommunications infrastructure between Ireland and 36 cities in Europe and the US. As a result of this contract, the levels of international bandwidth available in and out of the country have been greatly increased and now priced at internationally very competitive rates. This bandwidth has been available on the Irish market from August this year and contracts were signed to sell the capacity to six companies thus promoting competition in international bandwith.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, £21 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to £147 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and E-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced broadband infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>The first call for proposals under the measure was executed this year and the proposals are currently being ranked. I anticipate that I will sign contracts to the value of £77 million by the end of the year. The resulting increase in the competition in the supply of services will result in a downward pressure on prices.</P>
      <P>A large number of project submissions from both the Border, midlands, west and south and east regions have been received. The submissions are currently being assessed and evaluated at arm's length by independent consultants under the competition criteria. It is anticipated that contracts on selected projects will be signed before the end of the year and work on further extensions to broadband networks will start early next year.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to investment in the public transport system. The national development plan provides for the investment of £1.6 billion to improve the public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area &ndash; including enhanced services in the Kildare-Carlow area.</P>
      <P>As many as 16 new diesel railcars will enter service on the Connolly to Maynooth rail line on 2 January 2001. A further four new diesel railcars will enter service in February 2001. These new diesel railcars will provide an enhanced service between Maynooth and Dublin allowing increased passenger capacity and a more frequent service in both directions.</P>
      <P>A further 60 new diesel railcars have been ordered for delivery in 2002-2003 to provide for enhanced suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area. In addition, the national development plan provides for the quadrupling of the rail track between Hazelhatch and Sallins to separate long distance and suburban services on the Kildare line allowing for a greater frequency of suburban trains.</P>
      <P>The NDP identifies the provision of enhanced rail services to the development centres identified in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, including Naas, Newbridge-Kilcullen, Athy, Kildare and Monasterevin, as an option in the future development of the suburban rail network. The Dublin Transportation Office in its recent strategy document, A Platform for Change, sets out the strategic framework to maximise the use of existing rail lines and improve suburban rail services. A key element of this strategy is upgrading the signalling and rail track on the Kildare line to allow for a substantial increase in the number of peak hour trains. The DTO is currently preparing a plan for the implementation of this strategy which will be the basis for Government decisions in the matter.</P>
      <P>I recently met a delegation from Athy UDC in regard to improvements to rail services to and from the town. Their main concern was to improve the frequency of rail services and I have contacted Iarnród Éireann in relation to these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these anticipated improvements to the rail services, Bus Éireann is also examining the feasibility of an improved service with higher frequencies on the Portlaoise-Kildare-Newbridge-Naas-Dublin route. Improved bus services <Col N="195" /> should complement enhanced rail services in providing a substantially improved commuter services to passengers in the Kildare area.</P>

      <P>The accident involved a UK registered Cessna 172, which was visiting Kilrush Airfield. While aborting a landing, the aircraft struck the airfield's boundary hedge, bounced into the next field and crashed through the next hedge, coming to rest on the N78 Kilcullen-Athy road. Neither of the two occupants, both UK citizens, was injured, but the aircraft was substantially damaged. The report did not sustain any safety recommendations.</P>

The herd of the person named was inspected on 13 October 1999 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and it was found that seven animals were not tagged, another seven animals were not registered on the database and consequently had no passports, and 22 animals were not entered in the official herd register of bovine animals.

    <P>The second inspection of his herd took place on 9 October 2000 and it was found that the sale of 48 animals, which again he had not applied on under the scheme, was not recorded in the bovine herd register.

      <P>Thirty-seven Leader boards, 34 local action groups and three collective bodies, are operating the current Leader II programme now in its concluding stage. Some 13 Leader boards cover one county only. Eight counties &ndash; Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Limerick, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary &ndash; are catered for by more than one Leader board, that is, between two and five Leader boards. In addition there are two groups catering for islands and Gaeltacht areas. According to 1996 census data, the number of Leader groups with catchment areas of less than 40,000 people is six while eight groups cater for populations in excess of 100,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force on the integration of local government and local development systems, whose recommendations were endorsed by <Col N="206" /> Government, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that the county-city unit was to be the basic structure for local delivery arrangements. The report recognises that the bottom up nature of Leader may involve groups that cross county boundaries. The EU Commission requirements for Leader+ indicate that groups must be bottom up in nature and that artificial divisions of local areas will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>A cross-Department group in which my Department participates is overseeing the implementation of the task force report. Leader groups are participating fully in the county development boards &ndash; CDBs &ndash; established under the task force and groups appointed under the new Leader arrangements will also be required to participate. This entire process will, in line with Government policy, bring a greater coherence to local delivery arrangements including the Leader programmes.</P>

      <P>In its proposals for the scheme that commenced on 27 November 2000 which forms part of the rural development plan for the period 2000-06, my Department had included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The Commission indicated that this was not acceptable and that a fixed rate must be set. My Department then proposed a rate which was the average of the scale initially put forward. That was accepted by the Commission and is the rate provided for in the new scheme.</P>

    <P>The fee paid for each slaughter at the meat plant was £50 per animal until February 1998 when it was increased to £60. In cases where an animal is diagnosed with BSE, it is slaughtered on the farm of origin. The remainder of the herd is sent to a designated slaughter plant, slaughtered and sent for destruction. The slaughter of these herds is governed by Commission Regulation No. 1112/97. Article 1.2 of the regulation stipulates that no part of the animals slaughtered shall enter the human food or animal feed chain or be used for cosmetic or pharmaceutical purposes. The slaughterer is allowed retain the hides for leather production only. To this end the internal surfaces of the hides of these animals are stained to prevent harvesting of gelatine and other products that might potentially be used for animal feed or human food products.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an application under the 2000 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes on 30 May 2000.</P>
      <P>When finalising checks were carried out it was found that one animal was not in the ownership and possession on the date of application. Consequently the person named is not entitled to payment under the 2000 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes in line with the terms and conditions of those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was advised of the position on 14 November and asked to provide documentary evidence regarding the purchase of the animal in <Col N="212" /> question. Independent evidence was not provided and as a result the person named was informed of this decision on 8 December 2000. This letter of notification affords the applicant an opportunity to appeal the decision within 21 days.</P>
    <P>Prior to the information regarding the missing animal coming to the attention of the Department the person named was paid £1066.20 under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 25 October 2000 and as matters stand at present these moneys are now due to be refunded to my Department.</P>

      <P>Following an inspection by my Department in 1999 of the farm of the person named, a penalty was imposed because a habitat listed on the farm had not been retained. Retention of habitats is a fundamental requirement of the REP scheme. An appeal was lodged to the REPS appeals committee on behalf of the person named in January 2000 and this was forwarded to my Department's regional office for investigation. Because of the complexity of the case, two inspections have taken place and it is expected that the matter will be considered by the REPS appeals committee in January next and the person named will be informed of the outcome directly in writing.</P>

      <P>The schemes referred to which are EU co-financed have been closed to new applicants by my Department for a number of years. The closing date for the completion of investment works under these schemes has been extended by my Department on two occasions during the past 12 months in order to facilitate farmers who had encountered difficulties in completing their works by the specified closing date. However, I have asked my Department's officials to examine sympathetically individual cases where genuine reasons have prevented completion of works within the extended timeframe.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission brought forward proposals on 17 November 2000 for a draft directive on electronic invoicing. This will amend the EU sixth VAT directive to harmonise the rules on invoicing so that firms operating within the internal market will no longer have to cope with 15 different sets of rules on invoicing. It is expected that it will be discussed in the near future and will have to be agreed by the Council of Ministers before it can be transposed into national law.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no record of an application or enquiry by the person concerned regarding relief under the disabled drivers and passengers scheme. The position is that an application for the relief cannot be entertained without the issue of a primary medical certificate by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health authority. From inquiries made with the South Eastern Health Board, I understand that an application for a primary medical certificate has only recently been received and that this certificate has now been issued.</P>
      <P>The certificate should be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners, Central Repayments Office, Coolshannagh, Monaghan &ndash; phone (047) 82800, together with the appropriate application form, where the application for relief will be processed in the normal way. Application forms and further information on the scheme may also be obtained from that office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the first two years of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, that is, 21 April 1998-end March 2000, the statistical information available to me indicates that, in the Civil Service, of 12,650 or so requests received during this period, 2,130, or 17% were either transferred to another public body, were withdrawn or handled outside the Freedom of Information Act, or were still being processed. Of the remaining 10,532 requests, 8,273, or 78%, were granted either in full or in part. This leaves some 2,250 requests that were refused at the initial decision stage, pending the possibility of an internal review or an appeal to the information commissioner.</P>
      <P>In the local authority sector, of 2,628 requests received, 442, or 17%, were either transferred to another public body, were withdrawn or handled outside the Freedom of Information Act, or were still being processed. Of the remaining 2,186 requests, 1,793, or 82%, were granted either in full or in part leaving 393 requests that were refused at the initial decision stage, pending the possibility of an internal review or an appeal to the information commissioner.</P>
      <P>In the health boards, the relevant figures are: 2,966 requests received of which 709, or 23%, were either transferred to another public body, were withdrawn or handled outside the Freedom of Information Act, or were still being processed. Of the remainder of 2,257, 1,912, or 85%, were granted either in full or in part leaving 345 requests that were refused at the initial decision stage, pending the possibility of an internal review or an appeal to the information commissioner. More up-to-date statistics, that is, to include requests from March 2000, are currently being compiled, which will be forwarded to the Deputy when completed.</P>
      <P>With the aim of ensuring best practice and having regard to my functions and responsibilities under the Act, the operation of the Act has been kept under constant review, both centrally within my Department and also through the various fora established before the Act commenced in 1998. Of central importance in this regard is the FOI interdepartmental working group which is in turn supported by various user networks comprising FOI Officers from the public bodies that are subject to the Act. The information commissioner also has an important statutory role in reviewing the Act and may at any time carry out an investigation into the practices and procedures adopted by public bodies generally, or any particular public body, for the purposes of compliance with the Act generally or with any particular provisions of the Act. I understand his office will shortly undertake a general review of the operation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to ask each public body to review the terms of the operation of the FOI Act. Having regard to the statutory and administrative framework described, the role of the information commissioner and the extraordinary investment <Col N="219" /> in training staff for the implementation of the Act over the past two to three years, I am satisfied that adequate mechanisms exist for monitoring the operation of the Act on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>Under current valuation legislation child care facilities are liable for rates unless specific criteria for exemption can be shown. The principal grounds for such exemption from rates relate to the use of a property for public, charitable or educational purposes. In the area of education, exemption is limited to schools funded wholly or mainly from the public purse which do not rely to a large extent on fees, and which are not conducted for a profit. Consequently commercial child care providers are currently liable to rates. The Valuation Bill, 2000, does not alter this position.</P>

    <P>The relevant ceilings for first time buyers in 1999-2000 were £2,500 for single persons, £3,600 for widowed persons and £5,000 for married couples in respect of mortgage interest relief. The ceiling for widowed persons was increased to £5,000 for 2000-01. Assuming the enactment of the changes announced in the 2001 budget regarding granting the relief at source, the cost to the Exchequer in a full year, estimated by reference to the expected number of claimants in 2001, of increasing the existing ceilings to £5,000 and £10,000 respectively would be of the order of £11 million. These figures are provisional and subject to revision.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the International Monetary Fund proposals in respect of debt repayments will leave Zambia in a worse off position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29566/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficult situation faced by Zambia where, despite the application of the terms of the heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative, repayments on loans taken out during the 1990s and which are due to start next year would have lead to an increase in its debt repayments.</P>
      <P>I have expressed my concern to the Bretton Woods institutions, through the Irish representatives at both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund boards, that Zambia would still face an increase in debt service payments even after receiving full debt relief under the current terms of the initiative. I have stressed that Ireland will support any action necessary to ensure that Zambia's debt service obligations are reduced, and that account be taken of the capacity of Zambia to service debt post-HIPC.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the International Monetary Fund has now recognised the exceptional circumstances facing Zambia and on 1 December 2000 changed the rules governing IMF assistance under HIPC to permit the fund to accelerate debt relief for Zambia. This action was taken to address a hump in the country's total debt service payments resulting from Zambia's clearance of IMF arrears in 1995. It will buy some time to more fully address the problem of the hump in debt service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the IMF board's decision, and coupled with decisions by other creditors under the HIPC framework, Zambia's debt service payments in each of the next three years will now be lower than this year. In the absence of HIPC <Col N="222" /> assistance, Zambia's debt service would have more than doubled next year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recognise that the IMF and World Bank are constrained by the terms of the HIPC initiative which reflect the willingness of donor countries to meet the cost of whatever measures are to be taken.</P>
    <P>Debt relief, however, is not the whole picture. Fresh donor assistance to Zambia is already several times more than debt service. It is expected that overall net transfers to Zambia will rise by about $100 million next year to some 15% of GDP. The IMF too will be putting in more than it is taking out.</P>
    <P>The combination of accelerated debt relief and increased aid is expected to allow Zambia to raise social spending from $150 million this year to around $250 million in next year's budget. And that, more than the precise pattern of debt payments, is what matters most.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure the House that I will continue to work for the maximum possible degree of generosity to be shown toward Zambia and for the HIPC initiative to be implemented so that it achieves it original objective of giving the countries concerned an exit from the burden of unsustainable debt.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes does not have sufficient information about the taxpayer's pension income to determine whether the taxpayer is liable to pay income tax. As a married person over 65 years of age, the taxpayer's income up to £15,000 in the current year is exempt from income tax. The inspector has written to the taxpayer requesting information about his income. When he receives the information, the inspector will review the taxpayer's tax-free allowances and amend them as necessary so that any overpaid tax can be refunded to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The fact that the taxpayer ceased self-employment some time ago does not have a bearing on his tax liability, if any, in the current year. In relation to the taxpayer's PPS, formerly RSI, number, the inspector is satisfied that the correct number is being used in the tax office records. The other number referred to by the Deputy is a company number which ceased on 12 December 1996.</P>

This comprised £24 million for the State laboratory, £50 million for the laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and £9.5 million for the Marine Institute. These were preliminary estimates based on limited information available at the time. Since then a full and comprehensive evaluation of requirements necessary to meet modern laboratory standards, to allow accreditation of various laboratory procedures in line with EU directives and to meet health and safety requirements, has been completed and the total estimate is now £157 million for the relocation of the State laboratory and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories to Backweston. This estimate involves almost double the floor area originally envisaged. The estimate is still being examined. The Marine Institute is relocating to Galway and final costs are not yet available. In addition, a £3 million contract for the building of new conference and library facilities at the State laboratory in Abbotstown had to be terminated at a cost of £0.6 million including compensation to the contractor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189, 216, 217, 226 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new grades of clinical specialist and the therapy assistant are being progressed by my Department through talks with IMPACT on the implementation of the expert group report of various health professions. Unfortunately, speech and language therapists have withdrawn from this process.</P>
      <P>If and when speech and language therapists wish to rejoin the process, my Department and the Health Service Employers Agency are available to enter into discussions with them on the issues raised, including the clinical specialist posts.</P>
      <P>As referred to in last week's reply to a Parliamentary Question, talks are ongoing with IMPACT on the establishment of a therapy assistant grade and a training scheme for them. I am not in a position to give a date for the commencement of a formal training course. It is my aim to proceed with this as soon as possible, and my proposed expansion of the health professionals policy unit in my Department will facilitate this.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the therapy assistant grade has, as referred to in the expert group, the potential to provide the very necessary practical support for therapists in the delivery of an efficient and effective service. Such a development is intended to enhance the quality of care being provided to clients and, as such, it is not intended as a substitute for existing therapists but rather to complement the role of the therapist and ensure that patient care is maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group report recommended that talks commence between employers and staff in relation to the creation of a clinical specialist post for the therapy professions. The creation of this post will allow for career progression for those <Col N="226" /> who do not want to move into management. It would also ensure that clinical expertise is not lost to the profession.</P>
    <P>My Department has assigned a number of new clinical specialist posts to the speech and language therapy profession. However IMPACT states that it cannot accept any arrangements on behalf of the profession at the moment. Once the speech and language therapists rejoin the process, my Department will be in a position to allocate these new posts, which are part of a first tranche of such posts. The position will be reviewed by my Department after 12 months and an increase in the number of these posts will be considered at that stage.</P>
    <P>I am aware that training colleges are experiencing difficulties in accessing the appropriate number of clinical placement opportunities for students in a number of therapy professions. Officials of my Department have had initial discussions with the Higher Education Authority on the matter and further talks are scheduled for later this month. It is then intended that a meeting with the heads of the schools of training will then be held to review the position. It is essential that all parties adopt an imaginative approach to resolving this issue.</P>
    <P>The expert group report recommended the payment of an allowance to those involved in the clinical placement process. A sub-committee of the implementation group was established to refine this recommendation and it has produced an agreed report which is under consideration by the main group. I am confident that the improvements suggested by this report will be of considerable assistance in resolving this matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that my Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists. The report is expected by end-year and will address the number of additional training places required by these professions. Dr. Bacon has had talks with the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists in relation to the current issues of concern to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191, 245, 246 and 247 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed information concerning numbers of participants and locations of trials is not available in the Department and I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's questions to the Irish Medicines Board and requested that it provide me with the information sought, upon receipt of which I undertake to respond to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, introduced strict regulatory controls on the conducting of clinical trials in Ireland. Since the introduction of this Act, proposals for clinical trials must be assessed by the Irish Medicines Board and the IMB's approval must be obtained for all clinical trials including those conducted in psychiatric hospitals. All proposals to carry out trials are first assessed by internal staff of the IMB and then discussed at a clinical trials sub-committee meeting. The members of this committee are all physicians/surgeons in clinical practice and include a professor of psychiatry as a member. A decision to approve or reject a trial is then forwarded to the executive committee of the IMB and subsequently to the Human Medicines Advisory Committee. The IMB has also advised that all trials are conducted according to internationally accepted standards of good clini<Col N="228" /> cal practice &ndash; GCP. The IMB has a GCP inspector on its staff to ensure that these standards are applied. The proposed trial must also have the approval of an ethics committee in the hospital or institution concerned prior to commencement.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, sets out the requirement for informed consent by participants in clinical trials. Properly given, informed consent constitutes an important safeguard for the participant. For the purpose of ensuring that the consent is valid, the Act requires that the consent must be given in writing and signed by the person who is to be the participant in the trial; and the person consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent, and the consent is obtained by or on behalf of the person conducting the trial.</P>
    <P>To ensure informed consent, the Act &ndash; section 9(4) &ndash; requires that the person conducting the trial make sure that the volunteer is made aware of the following matters the objectives of the trial, the manner in which the substance or preparation is proposed to be administered; the risks and any discomfort involved in and the possible side effects of the trial; and whether the trial will involve the administration of placebos.</P>
    <P>The consent must be given in writing and signed by the person who is to be the participant. There are special provisions applying under section 9(7) in the case of patients who, for practical and other reasons, are unable to give their written and signed consent. These provisions require: (a) where the patient is capable of comprehending the significance of his consent, he can give his consent to the doctor treating him for that illness in any other manner provided it is clearly given and in the presence of two witnesses who are present at the same time. In such cases the consent must be expressed in writing and be attested by the signatures of the two witnesses; (b) where the patient is incapable of comprehending the significance of the consent to be given, he can only participate in the trial if written and signed consent to such participation is obtained from a person, or persons, who in the opinion of the Ethics Committee is or are competent to give such consent on his behalf. Such a person or persons must be independent of the person arranging to conduct the trial and of the doctor or dentist conducting the trial.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in both these instances it is not permissible to conduct a clinical trial unless the substance or preparation under trial is to be administered for the purpose of saving the life of the patient, restoring his health, alleviating his condition or relieving his suffering.</P>
    <P>In his 1999 report, the inspector of mental hospitals noted that all drug trials in psychiatric hospitals are the subject of approval by local ethics committees and are in conformity with existing legislation. The Mental Health Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas, will prohibit the conduct of clinical trials on patients who are held involuntarily for psychiatric care and treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Given that there is a solid legislative framework in place for the conduct of clinical trials generally and given that there is a rigorous process provided for specifically in relation to the matter of consent, I do not propose to undertake an investigation at this stage. However, if the Deputy has specific concerns about an individual case or individual areas, I will have enquiries made if he lets me have the details.</P>
    <P>Question No. 192 withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any formal application to my Department for the setting up of a complementary traditional medicines board outside the remit of the Irish Medicines Board and I do not propose to establish such a body. It has been the established policy of successive Governments and enshrined by the Oireachtas in the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, that responsibility for the licensing of medicinal products, including the giving of advice in relation to the control and use of such products, would be carried out by the Irish Medicines Board, including its expert advisory committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the board has the necessary expertise in traditional and alternative medicinal products and I am aware that it also has available to it a panel of experts that may on occasions also be consulted on individual licence applications and on certain aspects arising in applications. My Department also sanctioned the appointment of a herbal medicines project manager to the board <Col N="230" /> earlier this year to facilitate a detailed review of the arrangements to be put in place for the introduction of an interim licensing scheme for &lsquo;traditional and alternative' medicinal products.</P>

      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children has submitted an overall development proposal to the Eastern Regional Health Authority which has overall responsibility for the provision of acute hospital services in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>The authority has included some development at Our Lady's Hospital in its outline plan for utilisation of the national development plan moneys. The ERHA is examining the hospital's development plan in the context of the overall national development plan and the delivery of paediatric services in the eastern region as a whole. It will arrive at a decision in discussion with the hospital and based on priority of need in the context of the authority's competing demands for new developments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the theatre development at the hospital, I want to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is in a position to respond to the demand for its cardiology-cardiac surgery services. It was in this regard that my Department sanctioned the major theatre development at the hospital. This theatre development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. The necessary planning for this work is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that tenders for the work will issue in January 2001 with commencement of work on site in spring of 2001. This development is expected to cost in the region of £20 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that my Department approved two consultant posts for Bantry General Hospital earlier this year. The appointment of staff is a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The procedures in filling a consultant post involve, in the first instance, the submission of an application form to the Department of Health and Children, from the relevant agency, which identifies the financial and service implications of the post. The Department assesses this application and if considered appropriate from the financial and policy perspectives, would furnish approval to the agency. The agency then submits the post for clearance to Comhairle na n-Ospidéal. It should be noted that Comhairle can only consider an application for a consultant post on foot of Departmental approval.</P>
      <P>A post approved by Comhairle na n-Ospidéal is classified as vacant until an appointee takes up duty on a permanent basis. The selection and appointment process to be undergone following Comhairle approval can take some time. This involves preparing the necessary documentation, advertising the post, constituting an interview board, making a recommendation and ultimately agreeing a starting date between the employer and appointee.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as many factors can impinge on the time taken to complete this process, the Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to give a precise indication as to when consultant posts would be approved and filled.</P>

In <Col N="235" /> relation to the findings of the inquest in this case, my department has requested the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Western Health Board to consider the coroner's report.

    <P>In relation to the Cork centre, my Department made available capital grants totalling £524,000 to the IBTS during 1998 and 1999 to enable it to provide a new components processing laboratory and other improvements at the centre. In its report for 1999, the IMB noted that while the components area of the Cork centre is now of an acceptable standard a number of other problems <Col N="236" /> remained, including the basement area used for storage referred to by the Deputy. My Department has been advised that deficiencies in the areas identified by the IMB have been or are being rectified by the IBTS. Specifically, the IBTS has already identified the need for further capital investment in the Cork centre and has approved an outline planning brief. A more detailed planning brief is now being prepared and a project team has been established within the IBTS.</P>

I have already referred, in some detail, to the initiatives which have been taken at national level and in each health board in relation to inter-country adoption assessment. The statistical data provided shows the considerable progress made in this area in the last year. I am making a copy of the report of the group charged with implementing the recommendations of the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reasons for long waiting lists for assessment, I wish to refer the Deputy to chapter 1 sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the report, pages 5-6, chapter 6, which contains statistical data for the service, pages 43-52; and chapter 7, which refers to the implementation group's findings and includes a commentary on the waiting lists and planning for the future in a demand led service where demand is somewhat unpredictable, pages 55-56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will note from the statistics available that there were already more applications for assessment up to the end of September 2000 this year than in the total of 1999. Notwithstanding this trend, the national waiting list showed a marginal drop in the last quarter, September <Col N="238" /> 2000. I am satisfied that the initiatives already taken have brought about improvements in the nature and duration of assessment, as well as waiting times. I am optimistic that despite the increase in the number of applications this year that this trend will continue. It is in view of the continuing increase in demand that I have also had an additional £360,000 made available to health boards in 2001. This additional funding has been allocated with reference to waiting lists in each health board area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of refuge accommodation for victims of domestic violence is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant health board. In the eastern region the Northern Area Health Board has been assigned administrative responsibility for the refuges and domestic violence support services on behalf of the three area health boards in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the ERHA area there are three refuges for women and children who are fleeing violence from their partners-spouses. In these refuges there are a total of 24 units of accommodation for women and children. The Northern Area Health Board is aware that there is a shortage of refuge accommodation and has been working with three voluntary refuge management/development committees towards the creation of an additional three refuges in Newbridge, Tallaght and Blanchardstown. The total number of additional spaces on completion will be 18. The system of recording the number of women and children not admitted to refuges in the ERHA does not eliminate double counting which can lead to confusion. An improved recording system will be introduced in 2001 to rectify this situation. If a woman and children cannot be accommodated in a refuge they are referred to the Northern Area Health Board's homeless persons unit. If they cannot or do not wish to remain in their homes they are offered bed and breakfast accommodation until a refuge space becomes available. In 1999 the total number of women and children accommodated in this way was 53 and the number of individual women accommodated was 18.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At the request of my predecessor, the National Cancer Forum was asked to review symptomatic breast cancer services. A sub-group of the forum carried out this review. The sub group had the following terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer <Col N="240" /> screening programme, the increase in the target population, the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
    <P>The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs, the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services, the resources required to develop these service and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
    <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought regarding how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
    <P>The sub-group found that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>I have received the report of the sub group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. I established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group has met with Western Health Board officials and clinicians. I have provided additional funding to the Western Health Board in the letter of determination for 2001 for the development of symptomatic breast disease services. I understand that the Western Health Board is currently considering how best to develop breast disease services in its area and the board will submit a plan for the development of this service when complete.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to downgrade the service or facilities currently available in Mayo General Hospital. I intend to work with the Western Health Board in ensuring a comprehensive and coherent regionalised approach to the development of services for symptomatic breast disease in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is under way in my Department on a framework for a new pharmacy Bill which will update and consolidate existing legislation governing the practice of pharmacy.</P>
      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to bringing Ireland into line with other EU/EEA States where such controls exist in one form or another, improving standards in existing pharmacies and promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. In view of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the Free Movement of Pharmacists Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is proactive in promoting <Col N="247" /> a quality driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Because of public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licensing and supply of pharmaceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services throughout the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I met recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union during which, <i>inter alia,</i> the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects and also in the context of a new pharmacy Bill which I indicated that I would be bringing forward next autumn.</P>
    <P>The appropriate balance to be struck between public safety considerations and the general desire to remove any unnecessary obstacles to competition will be considered in the context of preparing the new legislation and reviewing the operation of the regulations.</P>

      <P>A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally over the years into possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields, EMF, surrounding power lines. The research has not substantiated a definite link between exposure to electromagnetic fields and ill health. Further research is ongoing involving the World Health Organisation and at EU level. The international EMF project was established by the WHO in 1996. In collaboration with international agencies and organisations, the WHO is pooling resources and knowledge concerning effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields and trying to identify gaps in knowledge in this area. This includes recommending better focused research programmes that allow better health risk assessments to be made and updating critical reviews of scientific literature. The WHO is working towards an international consensus and resolution on the health concerns. I have no plans to initiate research in this area.</P>

The renal dialysis unit was established at Mayo General Hospital in 1994 and the service is provided under the supervision of the consultant nephrologist. The consultant nephrologist also holds a clinic at Mayo General Hospital once a month. The Western Health Board will receive additional funding of £300,000 in 2001 to further develop renal services.</P>

    <P>The drug payment scheme is a community drugs scheme for non medical card holders to assist them with the cost of approved prescribed medicines and other items.

      <P>Following the publication of the report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I made available a total of £3.78 million to the health boards in 1999 and 2000 to expand and develop the home help service and provide appropriate training for home helps as recommended in the report.

    <P>Significant improvements have been made to the pay of home helps; the national minimum <Col N="252" /> wage of £4.40 per hour was implemented with effect from 1 April 2000, up from the £3 per hour minimum rate in April 1999.

I recently received a copy of a petition from a group of parents and teachers which requested that the Guidelines be amended in so far as they relate to the siting of masts in residential areas or near schools.

      <P>While I am aware that health, care and welfare services are provided to homeless persons, information on the level of these support services is not available in my Department. All the services provided to homeless persons by statutory and voluntary agencies fall to be comprehensively reviewed in the action plans which are now required to be prepared at city and county levels under the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness. As part of the development of these plans, all existing services for the homeless will be examined with a view to identifying any service gaps or deficiencies which exist, and putting in place together with appropriate responses to deal with these gaps or deficiencies.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional funding has been made available to assist in the delivery of services to the homeless. Capital spending over the next five years is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million to enable local authorities provide additional suitable accommodation, particularly move-on and sheltered accommodation. Current funding is being increased by £6 million per annum to fund increased payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement and outreach services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some homeless people are vulnerable and in need of additional support. In this regard, local authorities and voluntary bodies have been asked to consider, in the context of the action plans, the <Col N="255" /> need to provide additional transitional and sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons to move into accommodation that is more suitable to their needs. In addition, a £5 million capital allocation was made available to Dublin Corporation in last year's budget specifically for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction. Dublin Corporation is currently seeking to source suitable premises for these hostels.</P>

      <P>In the light of Ireland's obligations under Council Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste, and the position indicated by the National Waste Database Report for 1998, I appointed consultants to review generally the policies and measures in place for achieving our packaging waste recovery targets and, in particular, to evaluate the performance of Repak Limited to date, the prospects for achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery target for 2001, having regard to the activities of Repak Limited and other relevant or prospective developments; and the additional measures or structures which appear to be required in order to meet Ireland's packaging waste recycling-recovery targets for 2006.</P>
      <P>This review will include recommendations regarding further measures that could be undertaken by Repak Limited to support the recovery of packaging waste from the municipal waste stream, increase the recovery rate for packaging waste generally, and support the development of indigenous reprocessing capacity for packaging waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect very shortly to receive the final report of the consultants. In the interim, Repak Limited has initiated a new scheme of payments to waste contractors to further incentivise the recovery of <Col N="257" /> packaging waste. Funding is also available from Repak Limited to support the implementation of segregated household waste collection services such as that introduced this year in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for devising and implementing flood relief measures and provides local authorities with whatever support is requested in carrying out its responsibilities to relieve flooding. My Department's primary concern is to ensure that, when adverse conditions arise, local authorities are geared to respond promptly and effectively to help offset the worst effects in relation to those aspects for which they have direct responsibility. My colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, outlined to the House on 16 November, on the Adjournment, the actions taken by South Dublin County Council in this regard in response to recent flooding in Lucan.</P>
      <P>The River Griffeen catchment management scheme is being progressed under my Department's water services investment programme in the context of major development of water services infrastructure in the Lucan area. The scheme includes a range of works, such as stormwater retention ponds, surface water sewers and earthen berms to attenuate flows in the river. I approved the contract documents for the scheme last June. While the council is anxious to press ahead with the work urgently, I understand that fisheries concerns, and the likelihood of difficulties with earthworks in winter conditions, will mean that they will not be in a position to proceed until spring. However, the work will be finished before the end of the summer and, when completed, will reduce the potential for flooding and provide an increased level of protection in the area concerned. I have no direct function in relation to the other matters referred to.</P>

      <P>Design drawings and specifications for stage two of Shrule sewerage scheme, which would serve the areas referred to, were submitted to my Department in 1990 but have not been approved. The scheme was twentieth on the list of schemes submitted by Mayo County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme, 2000-2002, announced in July. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time. However, an application for an extension of the existing Shrule scheme to Dalgan Road under the serviced land initiative is being considered in the Department following receipt, on 27 November, <Col N="264" /> of additional information on the proposal from the council.</P>

The right to vote at parliamentary elections, subject to certain qualifications, was extended to women by the Representation of the People Act, 1918. Universal suffrage was provided for under the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann and the Electoral Act, 1923. A referendum to reduce the voting age from 21 years to 18 years was approved by the people in 1972 and provided for under the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1973.</P>

      <P>I have reviewed the manner in which the claw-back arrangements in the local authority low cost sites scheme apply to groups such as the Ballyowen Home Ownership Co-operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 June 2000 a subsidy was introduced by my Department to assist local authorities in the provision of low cost sites to eligible applicants. In addition a claw-back provision related to the difference between the market value of the site and the price at which the site was made available to the applicant was also introduced. The provision of a subsidy financed from public funds is necessary to encourage and assist local authorities to make sites available at low cost to eligible households seeking to attain home ownership while the provision for a claw-back is also neces<Col N="266" /> sary to ensure that there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house provided on a subsidised site.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently preparing regulations providing for the site subsidy and claw-back provisions. In this context transitional arrangements will be introduced which will provide that the claw-back provision will not apply where a formal written offer of a site was made by the local authority to an applicant on or before 15 June 2000. These transitional arrangements will apply in the case of the Ballyowen Lane co-operative. I have notified the Ballyowen group and the local authority accordingly.</P>

      <P>Depending on the type of PPP approach that is adopted in a particular case, be it by design-build, design-build-operate, or through the provision of a long-term service contract, there will be significant variations in the arrangements governing the management and operation of a sewerage treatment plant. In the case of a DBO contract or any long-term service contract, operation and maintenance of the plant will be the responsibility of a private company under a contract awarded by the local authority concerned. In the case of DB contracts the local authority will operate and maintain the plant.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I arranged for the publication of a report by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers on a policy framework for public private partnerships which provides general guidance on how the PPP approach is likely to operate within the roads, water services and waste management sectors. A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
      <P>Following on from this report the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the social partners and in line with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will be publishing further guidance in the form of a framework document setting out the principles governing the choice and implementation of PPP projects generally.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear, however, that it is envisaged that sewerage treatment plants will remain within public ownership and that no change is proposed in the position regarding domestic water and sewerage charges which were abolished under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>The legal basis for the administration of the town renewal scheme is provided in the Town Renewal Act, 2000. Detailed guidelines on the town renewal scheme were issued to county councils in July 1999, and these set out the objectives of the scheme, the criteria for the selection of appropriate towns, the criteria for the preparation of town renewal plans in those towns, detailed advice on planning and design considerations as well as advice on partnership, co-operation and consultations with relevant interests. The functions of a county council provided for under the Town Renewal Act, 2000, are not reserved functions.</P>
      <P>Town renewal plans submitted to the Minister by county councils were examined by an expert panel, established by the Minister to assist him in the performance of his functions under the Act. The panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and in making recommendations on the sites to be designated. In a number of cases, including the case of the town renewal plans submitted by Cork County Council, the expert panel sought clarifications and additional information from the relevant councils to enable recommendations to be made. In each case, including the case of Kanturk, the expert panel made an informed decision on the basis of all the information and proposals submitted by the county council.</P>

      <P>While section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, provides power to make regulations, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, requiring works to be carried out on newly constructed or improved roads to mitigate the effects of road traffic noise, this issue is at present dealt with on a case by case basis through environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>Forecasts of road noise levels are included in all environmental impact statements for major road schemes. Objections can be made on a wide range of grounds to proposed road developments, including the impact of increased noise, and objectors may raise their concerns at a public inquiry. The approval process for road projects, now operated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, but soon to be transferred to An Bord Pleanalá, can require modifications to be made to the scheme in relation, <i>inter alia, </i>to noise mitigation, and such modifications have been imposed as required.</P>
      <P>In view of the above approach, regulations have not been made under section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, in relation to noise mitigation on newly constructed roads nor are such regulations at present proposed.</P>

      <P>Detailed guidelines on the town renewal scheme were issued to county councils in July 1999. The guidelines set out the objectives of the scheme, the criteria for the selection of appropriate towns, the criteria for the preparation of town renewal plans in those towns, detailed advice on planning and design considerations as well as advice on consultations with local interests. Guidelines setting out the certification procedures to be implemented by county councils in connection with residential developments to be undertaken under the scheme will be issued shortly; guidelines dealing with commercial developments will issue when EU approval to this portion of the scheme is available, which is expected in late January or early February.</P>
      <P>A further set of guidelines providing for arrangements in relation to the monitoring of the scheme by county councils will be issued in the new year.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own revenue resources. The approval of my Department to the use of such funds is not required. Where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated housing estates the installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken. Local authorities may, if they so wish, on a case by case basis, seek approval to the use of their internal capital receipts which are in excess of the requirements of their programmes for the provision of local authority houses and the remedial works scheme for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings. Apart from the foregoing, there are no funds available from my Department for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In response to their request for funding for the provision of central heating in houses in Croke Avenue, Wexford Corporation were informed, in January 2000, that the Department would be prepared to consider a proposal from them to use internal capital receipts for this purpose. No such proposal has been received in the Department.</P>

      <P>My Department received a proposal earlier this year from Westport Urban District Council for approval to using internal housing capital receipts to fund an extension to the community centre at the rear of the council's old persons dwellings scheme at Ploughastal Court, Dis<Col N="274" /> tillery Road, Westport. However, as local authority internal housing capital receipts are required to fund the provision of new local authority housing and as no new local authority housing was involved in this particular proposal, the Department was not in a position to approve the proposal.</P>

In addition to motor tax, income from driver licence duties and certain miscellaneous fees and duties together with a contribution from the Exchequer are paid into the fund. The fund is distributed to local authorities as non-national road grants and general purpose grants. In 2000 Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council was allocated £8.15 million in respect of non-national roads and £21,369,728 as general purpose grants.</P>

      <P>The post of county or city planning officer exists only in Dublin and Cork cities and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin counties. The post is at the same level as the post of county or city engineer in each case. The proposals for strengthening management structures and abolishing the dual structure currently under discussion in Cork city and the three Dublin counties include the suppression of these posts in favour of the creation of new senior management posts of director of services. Under the new arrangements, the planning function in each of these authorities will be headed up by a director of service at management <Col N="277" /> level who will have responsibility for the management of all of the staff, both technical and administrative, dealing with planning matters. The new structures will have adequate numbers of senior planning staff to deal with technical matters. I support this approach, which is in line with what has been agreed nationally in relation to the post of county and city engineer. It is also in line with the approach outlined by the previous Government in Better Local Government. It would be inconsistent with this approach to agree to the creation of a new post of county planning officer in Cork County Council.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 envisages a penalty point system as a key measure in support of road safety enforcement. The Government approved the drafting of legislation necessary for this measure on 26 July 2000.</P>
      <P>The administration of the penalty points system will be supported by the proposed computerised national driver file, NDF, the application for which is currently being funded. In prospect of the NDF becoming available in 2001, a project team involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda and the Court Service has been set up to progress a penalty points capacity within the NDF and to ensure that relevant IT programmes of the Garda and the Courts Service, which are now also under development, can also handle a penalty points system. It is envisaged that the penalty points system will be in operation by 2002.</P>
      <P>The preparation of an Irish penalty points system has involved study of comparable systems operating in other EU member states both from a legal and organisational perspective. The intended design of the Irish system is unlikely, however, to permit any significant replication of the models operating in other countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 318 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, NDP, together with the community support framework and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, form the strategic policy context for the improvement of the national road infrastructure over the next seven years. In accordance with the Roads Act, 1993 it is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, within this framework to promote the detailed programming of the work required by the NDP and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, and the private sector in the context of public private partnerships, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
      <P>Major national road investment projects traditionally have had long lead-in times and the level of activity represented by the national development plan will require considerable acceleration of the road planning and design process. Progress is already being made in bringing major road projects to construction in the fastest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts are being made through better and earlier public consultation and through comprehensive environmental impact assessments to reduce the potential for objections to projects. Furthermore, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, streamlines certain statutory approval processes and the timing and nature of judicial appeals. It provides for the transfer of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes, compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements to <Col N="279" /> An Bord Pleanála, which must aim to decide on these matters within 18 weeks of the closing date for receipt of submissions. The requirements for ministerial approval of tolling schemes and associated by-laws are also being removed.</P>
    <P>A code of practice in relation to protection of archaeological heritage has recently been agreed between the NRA and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In addition, a broad ranging package of measures to improve the management of the planning and implementation of projects is being pursued by the NRA. The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development provides high level oversight and assistance in relation to delivery of the NDP.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that significant progress is being made on the advancement of the national roads programme as set out in the NDP, and that stated targets will be met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 328 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 recognised the need for safer roads and <Col N="280" /> included improvements at identified high accident locations among a range of measures designed to deliver this objective.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national road network, the strategy set a quantified target of implementing specific accident reduction measures, under NRA co-ordination and financing, at more than 400 additional locations by 2002. Measures of this kind have to date been put in place at some 293 additional locations on national roads and a further 69 remedial measure schemes will have been approved by the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy noted the greater difficulty of accurately identifying high accident locations on the non-national road network. It proposed first to improve the identification of such blackspots through appropriate geographic information systems, GIS, and that, with the assistance of this improved information and guidance from NRA, local road authorities should develop counter-measures in relation to accident blackspots on non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Improved GIS systems have now been widely implemented in line with the above. In addition, a new sub-programme of the non-national roads programme has commenced this year, and will continue, with the objective of reducing accident blackspots on non-national roads. In this first year of the sub-programme, it is estimated that some 45 blackspots will have been treated. This programme is expected to continue next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316, 317 and 320 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of almost £3 billion over the period 2000-2006 on water and sewerage services, divided into £1.3 billion in respect of water supplies, including the rural water programme, and £1.7 <Col N="281" /> billion for sewerage schemes. This is approximately three times the size of the expenditure for these services by comparison to the 1994-99 period.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I announced the first phase of a rolling three-year water services investment programme to cover the period 2000-02, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library. The programme contains details of 529 schemes which are at various stages of planning or construction. The schemes contained in the programme are drawn mainly from the results of the assessments of water services infrastructure needs completed by local authorities in 1999.</P>
    <P>Significant progress is being made in the advancement of water and sewerage services projects. This year will see the substantial completion of 23 major projects including Drogheda, Dundalk and Leixlip sewerage schemes. In addition 20 major water and sewerage schemes have commenced this year such as the North Fringe Sewer, part of the Dublin Bay project, Lisdoonvarna sewerage, the Limerick treatment works and Westport sewerage scheme. Among the significant schemes approved to enter planning are Ennis-Clarecastle sewerage, Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant, Lough Mourne-Letterkenny water supply, Enniscorthy and New Ross main drainage, Carrickmacross sewerage and Skibbereen sewerage.</P>
    <P>An important focus of water and sewerage investment is to facilitate new housing development in locations such as Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan and Athlone. The £2.1 billion Water and Sewerage Services Investment Programme for 2000-2002 also provides for the construction of a number of key housing related schemes in Dublin identified in action on housing,<i> viz.</i> Leixlip to Ballycoolin rising main, £10 million; Ballycoolin storage reservoir, £10 million; Swords north water main, £5 million; Balbriggan-Jordanstown storage, £10 million; north fringe water main, £12 million.</P>
    <P>Sewerage schemes that will have a specific impact on increasing the supply of housing have been approved for Patrickswell and Adare in Limerick, Oughterard and Headford in Galway and also in Tullamore and Mullingar. New water supply schemes supporting housing development have been approved for Kilkenny and Wicklow and an analysis of future water supply options for Kildare will also be undertaken to provide for future development in the area.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made with the serviced land initiative, which is a component of the Government's strategy for boosting housing supply to meet the unprecedented demand created by our economic success. By the end of 2001 schemes producing some 129,000 sites will have been completed or will be at various stages of construction. Other schemes are being looked at currently and I hope to announce a further package of funding under the SLI shortly. Once schemes have commenced the associated housing can usually be built in parallel. The positive <Col N="282" /> results of the investment in water and sewerage services over recent years in terms of housing is evident by the extent of serviced housing land currently available both in Dublin and in other key areas around the country.</P>
    <P>Overall, the expected out turn in expenditure on water and sewerage services in 2000 is £335 million, an increase of 16% on 1999 expenditure, which in turn represented an increase of 50% over the 1998 figure. This level of expenditure will continue to underpin continued sustainable social and economic development and is evidence of the progress being achieved in implementing the NDP objectives for the water services sector.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme, which involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low income purchasers on land provided by the local authorities, was launched last year as an additional measure to enable local authorities to assist low income house purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of suitable sites, including, <Col N="283" /> where necessary the acquisition of land, and the planning and construction of houses does, of necessity, require some time to arrange. While the expected output for this year at some 100 houses with 1,800 at various stages of planning is less than I had hoped, I am confident that additional measures which I introduced will assist in increasing output next year.</P>
    <P>These measures, as outlined in the Government's policy document Action on Housing, 15 June 2000, include a site subsidy of up to £30,000 in major urban areas and £25,000 in other areas which is now available to local authorities to enable them to provide houses at an affordable price and at a sufficient discount from market value. This subsidy will also apply to houses built for sale under the shared ownership scheme. These improvements, together with the provisions of Part 5 of the Planning and Development Bill will facilitate local authorities to acquire land to provide houses under the affordable and shared ownership schemes.</P>
    <P>The affordable housing scheme complements the shared ownership scheme and many local authorities are developing housing projects to provide low income house purchasers with an option to purchase under either scheme. Transactions under the shared ownership scheme increased significantly from 805 in 1998 to 1,314 last year and this increased level of activity is being maintained this year.</P>

      <P>At national level, responsibility for emergency planning rests with individual Government Departments for their own areas of responsibility. Each of the front-line emergency services, gardaí, health boards and local authorities, including fire brigades, have their own plans and strategies for dealing with major emergencies. The plans conform to the broad guidelines laid down in a framework plan for co-ordinated response to major emergencies which sets out the responsibilities of each service in an emergency and requires that plans be co-ordinated between services.</P>
      <P>In the case of the recent flooding, reports submitted to my Department indicated that major emergency plans were activated in six local authorities, also three local authorities activated local emergency plans. The local authorities, including the fire service, gardaí, Defence Forces, including Civil Defence, and health boards all played a role in responding to the situation and I would like to avail of this opportunity to again thank them for their tremendous efforts.</P>
      <P>While there is no national emergency plan an interdepartmental committee, IDC, chaired by my Department and comprised of representatives of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Defence was established in 1986. This committee is an advisory body only with no involvement in or responsibility for operational matters. It monitors and advises on the preparation, co-ordination and testing of plans by the local emergency services and monitors and advises on the co-ordination arrangements at national level to facilitate the response of the local authorities, health boards and Garda Síochána to major emergencies, etc.</P>
      <P>A meeting of this IDC took place on 6 December 2000 to review the response of the emergency services to the recent flooding. The meeting agreed to prepare a report reviewing the emergency management by the responsible agencies during the flooding situation under various relevant headings, for example, pre-planning and preparedness, response, recommendations for improvement etc. The report, which is being undertaken as a matter of urgency, will be submitted to me for consideration.</P>

      <Quest>his proposals to amend the free travel scheme to Irish pensioners living in Britain when returning home; if he will consider making provision for such cases in view of the special circumstances of such Irish immigrants.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The  free travel scheme, as in the case of other social welfare schemes in Ireland, is available to all eligible persons, residing in the State, irrespective of nationality. It would not be possible to extend the scheme to Irish nationals resident in Britain as this may be contrary to EU law, which in many instances prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality. This would mean, therefore, that if the scheme were to be extended on the lines suggested, it would have to be extended to all pensioners who are EU nationals coming to Ireland for temporary stays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of extending the free travel scheme to EU pensioners was examined in the review of the free <Col N="288" /> schemes which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, last April. The review considered that the primary objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it concluded that extending the scheme to visitors would not be in keeping with the objective of the free travel scheme. It should also be noted that such an extension would have significant administrative and cost implications, of the order of £8 to £15 million, depending on the level of concession granted. The free travel scheme is based on spare capacity and CIE have already expressed their concern about capacity constraints on the public transport system. Therefore, it is unlikely they would grant any further extension of the scheme on the current concession basis.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the review, my officials re-examined the recommendation on EU travel and concurred with the conclusion in the review. It was also noted that the free travel scheme is but one element of a package of benefits provided to older people and people with disabilities in Ireland. Governments in other member states provide varying packages of benefits, including higher cash benefits combined with reduced travel concessions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the free travel scheme were extended to visitors to this country, they would benefit from whatever provision is made for travel in the package of benefits they receive from their country of residence and access to full free travel here. The effect of this would be to disadvantage Irish residents who cannot avail of free travel concessions in other EU countries, particularly when they visit relatives in the UK. Thus, they would be more disadvantaged in travel terms when they go abroad than the visitors who come here.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if Ireland were to unilaterally extend free travel to senior citizens visiting from abroad, it would be, in effect, discriminating against many other groups in our society who could receive great benefit from the scheme and could be considered to be in greater need, discriminating against those covered for free travel here, who are not eligible for free travel when they go abroad, and over compensating many of those receiving it whose package of benefits from their own country of residence would reflect local travel costs.</P>
    <P>It is considered that any bilateral or multi-lateral arrangement would need to have the following elements at least: reciprocity &ndash; travel concessions for eligible visitors coming to Ireland would have to be reciprocated in the case of eligible people from Ireland going abroad, appropriate identification procedures &ndash; some internationally recognised travel pass would have to be introduced, issued by the country of main residence, for identification purposes and cost shar<Col N="289" /> ing &ndash; arrangements for sharing the costs between countries would have to be worked out.</P>
    <P>Given the detailed arrangements required to set up such a scheme, which is outside the remit of my Department, it might be considered more appropriate for the EU which is examining a broad range of concessions for older people in the social, cultural and travel area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 12 October 2000. Her case has been referred to an investigative officer of my Department for a means assessment and to confirm that the conditions for receipt of carers allowance are satisfied. Her entitlement will be further examined in the light of the investigative officer's report.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing an efficient service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
      <P>Whilst there has been an overall increase in the number of carers allowance applications awaiting determination, the majority are at an advanced stage of processing. The average time for deciding an application for receipt of the allowance is currently in the region of 12 weeks.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to carer's allowance there are medical, means and residency conditions to be satisfied and there is inevitably a time lag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable decisions to be made. The Deputy will also be aware that in recent years there have been a number of significant improvements to the scheme. The number of persons who now receive a carer's allowance has increased from 10,330 at the end of December 1997 to 16,405 at the end of November 2000.</P>
      <P>The substantial increase in the number of new claims affects the time taken to process claims generally. However, the level of resources required and the standard for claim processing will be kept under review to ensure that applicants receive a good quality service having regard to the conditions governing the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the recent budget I introduced a number of improvements <Col N="290" /> which greatly enhance the carer's allowance scheme. From April 2001 carers under 66 will receive an extra £8 per week and those over 66 will get an additional £10 per week. I have also raised the income disregards by £50 per week and £100 per week for single people and couples, respectively. This will enable an extra 5,000 people approximately to qualify for the allowance. I have also raised the respite care grant to £400 from June 2001. Carers looking after more than one person will receive £800 from that date.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide a basic weekly allowance to people who have little or no income. Those eligible for assistance under the SWA scheme have to satisfy a number of criteria, including a means test.</P>
      <P>People with low incomes may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, that is, rent and mortgage interest payments, or a payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have. The scheme is administered by the health boards and this Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The health board was contacted in the case of the taximan whose details were supplied by the Deputy. The board advised that the person concerned did not qualify for a payment based on the person's income assessment over the last 52 weeks and because the person has access to substantial savings.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's <Col N="291" /> school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. This represents an increase of £20 on last year's rates.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by low income households when faced with providing clothing and footwear for children at back to school time in September each year. I am also very conscious of the importance of supporting low income families so that their children can participate fully in the education system to the maximum extent possible. In that regard, I have established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is examining all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues.</P>
      <P>I expect to have the working group's report early in the new year.</P>

    <P>*The figure for 2000 includes the additional funding of £5 million which I secured during the year for the improvement of strategic Gaeltacht roads.</P>
    <P>As regards provision of funding for the improvement of roads in the Meath and Waterford Gaeltacht, I should point out that I together with officials of my Department recently met with officials of Meath and Waterford County Council in relation to the preparation of a programme of works for the year 2001 and subsequent years for the improvement of strategic Gaeltacht roads and also to have initial discussions on other schemes such as scéim na mbóithre áise administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to announce details of the strategic Gaeltacht roads to be funded in 2001 in the different Gaeltacht areas including Meath by early in 2001.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995 and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recently launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to Waterford Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building <Col N="294" /> which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am advised by Waterways Ireland that it is satisfied that the operation of the proposed hydro-electric scheme will have no adverse effect on navigation. The proposed development was assessed from a nature conservation perspective by the national parks and wildlife section of my Department. The proposed site is not in any special area of conservation, special protection area or natural heritage area nor would the proposed development have a significant negative impact on any such site. Likewise, it would not significantly impact on any protected plant or animal species.</P>

      <P>My priority with regard to the funding of RTE is to finalise my consideration of the application made by RTE to increase the television licence fee by £50. I have engaged the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers to advise my Department on the matter. When the application has been considered fully, I will bring whatever <Col N="296" /> proposals may emerge to Government for approval. In addition to licence fee revenue, RTE can generate commercial revenue through advertising and other commercial activities. I have no plans at present to make any changes to this situation.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of an impending EU Directive in regard to public service broadcasting. I understand that the European Commission is currently drawing up internal guidelines to assist it in dealing in a consistent manner with complaints under State aid rules relating to the funding of public service broadcasters. No such guidelines have been published as yet. As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 120 on 4 October 2000, my position, which is a position shared by all the member states, is that public service broadcasting, as recognised by the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty must be upheld and cannot be allowed to be undermined.</P>

      <P>The £78 million in capital funding for the built heritage which I announced on 5 November last was in respect only of properties in the care of the State. This funding will be provided through the capital allocation for the built heritage in the Vote of my Department and the total programme reflects the funding to be made available to me from the Exchequer under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>In deciding on where funding for the built heritage should be allocated in the period to 2006 I gave full consideration to the 740 properties under my control and reached the decision that the emphasis for the period in question should shift from the provision of new or improved facilities for visitors at heritage sites, which has been the main focus for the last decade or so, to the conservation of heritage properties. To this end, and following the review of properties I just referred to, I identified approximately 100 sites which I considered were in need of investment from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view and I allocated £65 million to allow the necessary work to be undertaken in a phased manner in the period to 2006. A further £13 million will be available for minor works at national monuments and historic properties in State care in the same period.</P>
      <P>In this context the following properties in County Kildare will be addressed in the programme &ndash; Maynooth Castle, Jigginstown Castle, Castletown House, Moone High Cross and Grange Castle.</P>

      <P>Over the ten year period from 1989 to 1999 the emphasis in relation to national monuments and historic properties was the provision of new or improved facilities for visitors at sites in the care of the State. As a result of this emphasis we now have quality facilities for both the general public overseas visitors at more than 70 sites across the country. Examples of the type of facilities provided over the ten year period I refer to, include the new visitor centre at Dún Aonghusa on Inis Mór, the completion of new visitor, restaurant and educational facilities at the Botanic Gardens and the completion of a new pier to improve visitor access to Scattery Island. Full details of all the facilities available at heritage sites in State care are available in the booklet Visitor Information of Heritage Sites of Ireland. I am arranging for a copy of the 2001 edition of this booklet to be sent directly to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> I am satisfied that this investment in visitor facilities is sufficient to meet current demands on sites and for this reason I decided that the main emphasis for the period to 2006 will be on the conservation of heritage properties. However, my Department will be undertaking the upgrading of audio-visual displays at a number of key sites, as well as an extensive programme which will involve providing information panels at important sites where there is no guide service.</P>

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services which is responsible,<i> inter alia, </i>for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers is currently providing emergency full board accommodation for approximately 3,200 asylum seekers around the country. The directorate has been accommodating asylum seekers under these arrangements since 10 April 2000. Prior to this, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers was handled, in the main, by the Eastern Health Board in whose administrative area the majority of asylum seekers are located.</P>
      <P>The average period of time that an asylum seeker in such emergency accommodation is dependent on the processing time for applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> In that regard, the objective is to minimise the time taken from the date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards and enables applications to be processed within six months.</P>
    <P>To that end, the Government in July of this year approved a further staffing package of 370 for the asylum-immigration area of my Department. The arrangements for recruiting these staff members are now well under way.</P>

      <P>Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations under international law and the Constitution to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers. For the most part, it represents a cashless <Col N="301" /> system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full-board basis.</P>
      <P>All offers of accommodation for asylum seekers are assessed by the Directorate for Asylum Support Services in conjunction with other relevant authorities, such as the local environmental health services who inspect premises to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</P>
      <P>When sourcing and procuring accommodation suitable for asylum seekers, of which there is a severe shortage throughout the State, the directorate makes every effort to ensure access to a range of necessary services. Social welfare, health and educational services in Ireland are organised on a regional and local basis and asylum seekers have the same access to these services as the indigenous population.</P>
      <P>In the case of family accommodation, every possible effort is made to achieve the right match between configuration of rooms and family size/gender composition.  </P>
      <P>With regard to catering arrangements, all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that different ethnic tastes are catered for and any complaints about menus are promptly examined by the directorate.</P>
      <P>Every newly arrived asylum seeker receives an information pack (available in 22 different languages) on the asylum process, the location at which s/he is to be settled and entitlement to services.</P>
      <P>The refugee legal service &ndash; RLS &ndash; provides a comprehensive and quality legal service to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process regardless of their location. The RLS has adapted its services to take account of the dispersal of asylum seekers and plans to develop its services on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of Government policy in relation to the determination of claims for asylum is to reduce processing times to a maximum period of six months, without compromising the fairness of procedures and as a consequence, to minimise the time spent in direct provision correspondingly.   </P>
      <P>I believe the system of direct provision represents a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers. While the scheme of direct provision is being monitored on an ongoing basis, I have no plans, at present, to introduce alternative arrangements.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my written answer to Parliamentary Question No. 160 of 6 December last regarding the names of <Col N="302" /> those offered appointment to the Human Rights Commission.</P>
      <P>I advised delegates at a Conference on Human Rights in Dublin Castle over the weekend, that the Government, having regard to the recommendations of the selection committee, took some time to ensure that the balance of skills and representation on the commission was, in its view, the best that could be achieved in line with the statutory and international criteria that are relevant in the case of national institutions of this type.Colour RGB 0,0,128 Following on from this considerationColour RGB 0,0,128<b>, </b>the Government is putting in place a commission that will cover as wide a spectrum of interests in the human rights sphere as possible, to satisfy the requirement of representation as set out so clearly in the enabling legislation. Of necessity, that Government decision required that a choice be made by reference to a range of considerations, and I believe that the combination of expertise that the selected people will bring to the task will ensure that the public generally, in all its diversity, will be well served in terms of human rights and protection.</P>
      <P>However, as I also said at the conference, I am taking the views of the NGOs on board with a view to addressing their concerns.</P>

The review group is due to report before the end of the year and, while I personally favour the abolition of the height restriction, I will carefully consider whatever recommendations are contained in their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> In relation to the present height requirements, any recommendation for change in this regard would, if acted upon, require the amendment of the existing Regulations (the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988).</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 359 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> The administrative arrangements for the provision of transcripts of criminal trials are a matter for the Courts Service and I have no direct function in the matter.</P>
    <P>Once again, I have checked with the Courts Service and it has informed me that, unusually, the verbatim note of this trial was made by three different stenographers. At the outset, the service was provided by one of the Courts Service's own staff stenographers, who was forced to withdraw after the first day due to illness. Sadly, she has since died. Two firms of freelance stenographers were engaged to complete the trial.</P>
    <P>At the time the reply to the Deputy's previous Question was being prepared, both firms of stenographers had provided their transcripts to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It was only when the transcripts were subsequently examined by the Courts Service that it came to light that the note for the first day of the trial, which had been taken by the Courts Service's staff stenographer, was not included. As the person concerned had died, there was a delay in locating her tapes of the trial. These have been located and I understand from the Courts Service that arrangements have been made for the remaining transcript to be provided to the Court of Criminal Appeal as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The solicitor in question has been informed by the Courts Service of the reasons for the delay in furnishing the transcripts in this case.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the position whereby long-term foster children are currently treated differently from natural children for inheritance tax purposes. Where specific provision is made by a testator for a foster child, a foster child can, of course, inherit and, following the announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the Financial Statement of 6 December, the child will, following implementation of the forthcoming Finance Act, be treated as a natural child for the purposes of payment of inheritance tax.</P>

      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, at present before this House, which introduces radical new measures to deal with those who commit sexual offences, also introduces for the first time in our law, separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases during applications to adduce evidence or cross-examine on the complainant's past sexual history. This measure shows the determination of this Government to do all it can to encourage the victims of these crimes to report, and participate in the prosecution of, those responsible.</P>
      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill arose primarily from an analysis of the views received on the chapter of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which dealt with a sex offenders' register and post-release supervision. When that Bill is enacted the remaining chapters of the discussion paper will be examined in the light of an analysis of the views received on them. Amongst the wide range of issues addressed in the discussion paper was the position of the complainant in the criminal trial process. Chapter 5 of the paper sets out the measures already introduced over recent years in order to improve that position. The question of whether there is a need for any further legislative or other measures will form part of the forthcoming examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no record in my Department of any formal application being received for a Garda CCTV system in Drogheda.</P>
      <P>Representations were received earlier this year requesting the installation of a Garda CCTV system in the town and detailed responses issued at the time advising, <i>inter alia</i>, of the procedure to follow in this regard. No formal application has, however, since been received either in my Department or by the advisory committee, that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV applications, in respect of Drogheda.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. They may then be considered by the advisory committee who will make a recommendation to me in this regard. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting, etc.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime and public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances or needs that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced an expansion of Garda CCTV sys<Col N="309" /> tems. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to will be installed in the period 2001-2002. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme in 2001 to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The life sentenced prisoner to whom the Deputy refers, Mr. Thomas Murray, was convicted in the Central Criminal Court last week, on 5 December 2000, of the murder of Mrs. Nancy Nolan, a retired school teacher, on or <Col N="310" /> about 14 February 2000. I share the horror of all right thinking people at this murder and I join all those who have extended their sympathy to the family of the victim in their tragic loss. I readily acknowledge the public's concern that the offender was on temporary release from prison at the time he committed the murder.</P>
      <P>There are long-established procedures in place in relation to the administration and eventual release of life and long-term sentenced prisoners. The current procedures have been followed by successive Administrations since 1989.</P>
      <P>In most cases, including this one, a person serving a life or long-term sentence may have the sentence reviewed by the sentence review group, SRG. The SRG, which functions on the same general lines as parole boards in other jurisdictions, is a non-statutory body established in 1989 to advise Ministers in relation to the administration of long-term prison sentences. It includes persons with long experience of working with ex-prisoners and their families. The SRG reviews the cases of individual offenders who have served seven years or more of a current sentence including life sentences but excluding offenders serving sentences for capital murder. Following review, the SRG makes recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform advising of an offender's progress to date, the degree to which that offender has engaged with the various therapeutic services available, and how best to proceed with the future administration of that offender's sentence.</P>
      <P>The criteria applied in reviewing the cases of life sentence prisoners includes the following assessment of potential risk to the public; the seriousness of the offence committed; behaviour while in prison; the views of the Garda Síochána; compassionate grounds; and recommendations by the sentence review group. The process leading up to recommendations made to the Minister involves consultation with various individuals and agencies who are best placed to make an assessment as to the individual's readiness or otherwise for temporary release but the overriding concern, when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, a number of serious offenders have benefited from temporary release concessions under these arrangements. Eighty offenders who were committed on life sentences are currently on release in the community. The majority of these offenders served between nine and 16 years in custody. In practice, all such offenders were granted renewable temporary release whereby, unless the conditions of release are breached, there has been no requirement to return to prison except to renew the temporary release at specified intervals. Offenders on renewable temporary release must be of good behaviour. Other general conditions include supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service and reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station. Other specific conditions may be applied to fit individual circumstances. Temporary <Col N="311" /> release automatically ends if any conditions are breached. In such an event the individual concerned can automatically be returned to custody without warrant or without any further court proceedings. There are currently six life sentenced prisoners in custody who have been recommitted following their failure to abide by the conditions of their release. These offenders were initially released between October 1996 and January 2000.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is unfortunately the case that, despite the most careful assessment being made in advance, certain individuals will tend to breach the trust that has been placed in them and will reoffend, sometimes, as in this case, with serious and tragic consequences. Other jurisdictions, sadly, have similar experiences.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, make the point that I have put a stop to the revolving door syndrome whereby offenders were released because of a shortage of prison accommodation. Prisoners are not now released for this reason and most of those who are released are released under some form of supervision or reporting arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, some time ago, I announced my intention to establish a statutory parole board &ndash; it is part of our current Government programme. I have also announced my intention to establish this board, in the first instance, on an administrative basis and I shall make an announcement on this in the very near future. It would be less than frank, however, not to acknowledge that, even where full statutory parole systems operate, cases, sadly, arise from time to time where offenders granted parole proceed to breach the trust placed in them.</P>
    <P>Because of the very serious consequences which arose from the granting of temporary release in this case and the very understandable level of public concern it has generated, it requires and deserves a specific response and I have, therefore, decided to have all aspects of the handling of the case reviewed as a matter of urgency. The review will be undertaken by Mr. John Olden, the retired former Secretary General at the then Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who has practical prior experience of Irish prisons administration and is currently the Irish member of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane Treatment in Custody. I propose to make the results of Mr. Olden's investigations available to the House and the family. I will, of course, consider carefully any recommendations emerging from this review.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing free fees for part-time students generally, similar to those given to full-time students, could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. However, the White Paper on Adult Education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, indicates that arrangements will be implemented so that higher education fees, in respect of certain courses, will not apply to part-time students, who satisfy the residency clause, and who are social welfare means tested or unemployment payment recipients or dependants, medical card holders or dependants, persons in receipt of family income supplement or dependants.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1996, as amended by the Finance Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses which are of a minimum duration of two years and are followed in colleges approved for the higher education grants scheme or in colleges which satisfy the prescribed codes of standards.</P>
      <P>In the 1997 Finance Act provision was made to extend tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</P>
      <P>In relation to the above reliefs, the maximum level of qualifying fees is £2,500.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 and 400 together.</P>
      <P>I have previously welcomed the report, referred to by the Deputy, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post-primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements, are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. The Deputy will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the <Col N="319" /> funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and it is my intention that this report will inform policy on future school funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the meeting of 22 November was to discuss, with representatives of the main survivor groups, plans for the establishment of a national office to support victims of abuse, and in so far as possible to involve those groups in the operation of this office. Representatives of the Right of Place, Aislinn, ORIA, SOCA UK and Irish SOCA groups were present. All these groups operate on a national basis &ndash; SOCA UK in the UK. In addition, representatives of two smaller groups, which operate in particular local areas, Right to Peace and JHFA, were also present.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the office which my Department has established, together with the Department of Health and Children and the relevant health board, is to provide information and support to victims of abuse in childhood. In particular, it will provide information to the victims on the various Government initiatives designed to meet their needs, including the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the counselling services provided by the health boards. It will also provide, more generally, information on a wide range of education and social programmes and will assist, as far as practicable, victims of abuse to access these services.</P>
      <P>It has always been the intention that the main survivor groups would have a meaningful role in the operation of this office. These groups, who have direct and ongoing contact with the many survivors nationally, can ensure that the services and activities of the office are best suited to survivors' needs. The office will also provide support services to the groups involved, that is, telephone and fax facilities and meeting rooms.</P>
      <P>The meeting of 22 November was called to allow for the formation of a management committee comprised of the main survivor groups, who would advise the office manager on the operation of the office.</P>
      <P>Regrettably before the meeting itself was opened, disagreements broke out between some of the groups attending, which ultimately led to the departure of the representatives of Irish SOCA, and the two smaller regional groups, JHFA and Right to Peace. The representatives of ORIA also left the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following their departure, the remaining groups, who together represent the majority of survivors in both Ireland and the UK, were strongly of the view that the process of establishing the office must continue. Accordingly, a management committee drawn from these groups has been put in place, to advise the office manager on the operation of the office. The involvement of the other groups on the management committee will now be a matter for the committee and the office manager. My Department will not now have a direct involvement in the operation of the office, other than to assist the office <Col N="323" /> manager, and the management committee as they request.</P>
    <P>I would be happy for officials of my Department to meet the Deputy to discuss this issue further. Alternatively, the Deputy may wish to discuss the matters directly with the management committee, who may be contacted through the office manager at 01-8728182, or if the Deputy should contact my office, I will be happy to facilitate such a meeting.</P>

      <P>The preparation of a mission statement is part of the school development planning process. The school development planning initiative &ndash; SDPI &ndash; was established with effect from 1 September 1999 to assist schools in furthering the process of collaborative whole-school planning.</P>
      <P>As part of the initiative, at second level, there is a panel of approximately 75 trained facilitators who are available to schools on a part-time, occasional basis. These and other facilitators are engaged by the schools and are paid fees and expenses by the schools, depending on the service they give; these payments are in accordance with guidelines based on rates applicable to inservice provision generally.</P>
      <P>The Department does not keep records of the facilitators engaged by schools or the amounts the schools pay them.</P>
      <P>The work of the facilitators is co-ordinated, supported and supplemented by full-time regional co-ordinators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> At primary level, there are 16 full-time facilitators serving as part of the school development planning initiative; all of these were appointed since I took up office. The names of the facilitators are: Margaret J. Bleach, Christy Carroll, Dympna Daly, Roisín Doherty, Fiona C Dunne, John Ewing Fitzgerald, Mags Jordan, Steve Lane, Anne Lynch, Sally McGinley, Caoimhín Ó hEaghra, Mary O'Leary, Bernadette Uí Mhaolbhuaidh, Mary Martin, Rosemary Dunne and Enda Flynn.</P>
    <P>For the period of their assignments, facilitators are paid on the following payscale, with effect from 1 October 2000: £30,754 &ndash; £31,893 &ndash; £33,033 &ndash; £34,171 &ndash; £35,311, adjusted as appropriate in accordance with general pay round increases which may arise in the future.</P>
    <P>They are placed on the point of this scale that is nearest to and above their current annual salary, including allowances. Appointees are, on an exceptional and personal basis, allowed to retain their existing teacher salary and allowances if this is higher than the maximum of the above scale.</P>
    <P>The work of the facilitators at primary level is also co-ordinated, supported and supplemented by full-time regional co-ordinators.</P>

      <P>In addition to the financial assistance available under the grant schemes for further and higher education, hearing impaired students attending courses in third level colleges-institutions and post leaving certificate centres, may apply for assistance from the special fund for students with disabilities. The purpose of the fund is to provide grant assistance to students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities towards the cost of special equipment, including computers, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated to the fund has increased substantially each year from £80,000 in 1994 to more than £1 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for assistance under the fund are received by my Department at the beginning of the academic year. Completed application forms are normally forwarded to my Department by the disability officer, or the responsible officer of the institution. In the current academic year, institutions were requested to return all completed application forms by 20 October 2000. The fund is administered centrally by my Department with the assistance of an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group which consists of representatives of the Department, a representative from the Association for Higher <Col N="325" /> Education Access and Disability &ndash; AHEAD &ndash; and a representative of the Higher Education Authority &ndash; HEA.</P>
    <P>Allocations from the fund are being finalised at present and my Department will be notifying the relevant colleges-third level institutions of allocations under this year's fund within the coming week. Individual applicants will also be notified directly of the outcome of their application and the level of their award.</P>
    <P>The Government is providing for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities at third level education. Accordingly, in September 2000, I established an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by the three target groups. I have asked the group to report to me within three months.</P>

      <P>The ASTI lodged its claim for an immediate 30% increase last March. My Department negotiated with the ASTI and made an offer on its claim. The offer was not acceptable to the ASTI. The matter was then referred to an agreed independent board to adjudicate on the matter. The ASTI accepted that the independent arbitration board was the appropriate body to adjudicate on its claim and both the ASTI and my Department put our arguments to the board. The board rejected the 30% claim and recommended the pay increases applying to other teachers and public servants under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness should be applied to ASTI members. It also recommended that its claim should be further examined by the independent body, under the chairmanship of a High Court judge, set up to examine all public service pay and known as the Public Service Benchmarking Body. The board further stated that it did not believe that &ldquo;it would be appropriate for it to determine the pay for one particular group of workers outside the norms which have been accepted by the majority of workers having regard to all the consequences which could flow from such a course of action.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I immediately implemented the recommendations of the independent arbitration board which has resulted in an increase of 8.5% being applied to teachers' salaries from 1 October last. The improved terms of the PPF agreed between the social partners last week will give teachers improved increases over the next two years amounting in total to a cumulative pay increase of almost 22% under the PPF. In addition teachers will also receive the benefits of tax cuts under the PPF worth at least a further 10%. The new PPF terms also provide that one quarter of any increase arising from the report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body will be implemented with effect from 1 December next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met ASTI on Monday, 4 December. This was in response to numerous public statements from them seeking to meet me and the clear expression by both the Taoiseach and myself of our willingness to listen to its views. While I listened carefully to the views and suggestions put to me, it was clear that the ASTI position had not changed and that it wanted to be treated completely separately from other public service unions. However, I am shocked and dismayed at the latest ASTI decision to escalate its industrial action to include further strike days and the ban on co-operation <Col N="327" /> with leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations. The fact that this decision was made at the end of a week in which the improved terms of the PPF together with the budget tax concessions were accepted by other public service unions, including the other two teacher unions, as meeting their immediate concerns makes the ASTI position even harder to understand.</P>
    <P>The social partnership framework provides appropriate and adequate means of addressing the issues of concern to the ASTI and I am available at any time to meet the ASTI to progress matters within that framework. However, I am in complete agreement with the views of the independent Arbitration Board that the ASTI members cannot be dealt with outside the norms which have been accepted by the majority of workers, including other teachers.</P>

      <P>The national reading initiative was launched on 21 January 2000 as a one year initiative with two briefs: to raise awareness in the general public of the importance of reading and to lay the foundation for improving the quality of the teaching of reading in the formal and non-formal sectors.</P>
      <P>The initiative was a community-wide initiative, collaborating with schools, libraries and voluntary community groups. Opportunity was given to local groups across all sectors to apply for funding to design, organise and run community-based projects aimed at increasing reading use and-or improving reading standards. The interdepartmental and interagency involvement, together with the public response from all sectors and all counties in the country has made this initiative a great success.</P>
      <P>Since the launch, in January of this year, the initiative has been involved in a multi-media campaign; a book project where five free books are being distributed through the health boards to every baby born in 2000; an international reading conference; a teaching aid video on the implementation of the revised English curriculum &ndash; primary; a summer course for teachers entitled Nurturing Lifelong Readers; a transition year competition.</P>
      <P>The initiative is now nearing the end of its one-year term and all of the planned projects are either up and running or nearing completion. Success of an initiative of this kind is very much determined by its defined timeframe and I do not believe that prolonging the initiative for a further period would yield equivalent results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the importance of literacy in <Col N="328" /> surmounting the barrier between exclusion and inclusion within our society. Literacy is a concern of constant focus for my Department and the national reading initiative is one of a number of measures I have initiated which will ensure a definite and lasting contribution.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the valuable groundwork laid by the national reading initiative is utilised fully, a final report on the different elements of the initiative will be prepared in the coming weeks and my Department will review the results achieved.</P>
    <P>This review will assist me in identifying the elements of the initiative which could be repeated or enhanced in future years.</P>

      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by these students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as a purely initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that I would expect that some 10,000 students will benefit from this measure. This is, of course, a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference require that it advise <Col N="331" /> me, <i>inter alia</i>, on the development of targeted interventions and actions and the identification and tracking of the target groups.</P>
    <P>The action group will advise on the operational details of the measure and, in the meantime, it is not necessary for grantholders to apply for the special rate of maintenance grant. Once details have been finalised, arrangements will be made by my Department to ensure that all qualifying grantholders are placed on the special rate of maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>The aim of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for rural pupils who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending school regularly. Given the high costs involved, this must be achieved in an efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the centre referred to by the Deputy was that the school bus service in question was oversubscribed at the start of the current school term. It was not possible to operate an additional run by that bus to cater for the surplus pupils. There was another school bus service available with surplus capacity, within a reasonable distance, but the families refused to avail of this service and demanded that an additional vehicle be provided. I understand that there were four pupils involved.</P>
      <P>As a temporary measure and in order to accommodate the pupils in question, it was decided to introduce an additional bus, pending a review by Bus Éireann of the overall transport situation in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this review it was determined that an alternative arrangement could be made at considerable less cost than an exclusive bus and with little time inconvenience for the pupils con<Col N="332" /> cerned. This involved utilising a minibus, which provides a primary school service in the general area, to take the surplus pupils to post-primary school. Approval was given to Bus Éireann to put this alternative arrangement in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question raises a number of points in relation to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as issues related to the curriculum are concerned, I wish to outline a number of ways in which the issue of sects is addressed either directly or indirectly. In summary, these are to be found in the social, personal and health education programme at primary level and in the civic, <Col N="334" /> social and personal education and religious education syllabi at second level.</P>
    <P>Social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; is a new subject which is included for the first time in the recently revised primary school curriculum. It is designed to be delivered in three ways: through the attitudes, values and practices conveyed in a positive school climate and atmosphere, through integration with other subject areas in a cross-curricular approach and through dedicated curricular time. Among the aims of the SPHE programme are to promote the personal development and well-being of the child, and to enable the child to make informed decisions and choices about the social, personal and health dimensions of life both now and in the future. Pupils are taught to be aware of and to respect the various cultural, religious, ethnic or other groups that exist in their communities. They are also taught self-protection and safety skills such as identifying and avoiding situations and people who make them feel threatened and accepting an increasing degree of responsibility for their own safety and well-being as they get older. They are encouraged to be assertive, to know when to seek help and to confide in people, whom they consider to be trustworthy, such as their parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>At second level, civic, social and political education &ndash; CSPE &ndash; prepares students for active participatory citizenship. The syllabus is based on a number of central concepts which collectively inform and clarify the concept of citizenship. These include democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity and law. The syllabus helps students to develop their ability to explore, analyse and evaluate. It enables students to become skilled and practised in moral and critical appraisal and capable of making decisions and judgments, based on human rights and social responsibilities. In its methodology and assessment procedures, there is a significant bias towards the application of practical skills required for participatory citizenship. Thus, students are equipped to confront such issues as the work of groups who might seek to impose their beliefs on others by illegal means or through the use of undue pressure or duress.</P>
    <P>The phased introduction of a new religious education syllabus for junior cycle was begun in 50 schools in September 2000, with the first junior certificate examination in the subject scheduled for 2003. This syllabus deals with the foundations of religious belief through a study of major world religions. It is understood that a leaving certificate syllabus, which is at an advanced stage of preparation, allows a more detailed study of world religions incorporating new religious movements. The syllabus will focus on the definition of a cult, on common characteristics and new religious movements. The treatment of this topic will be in the context of the educational rationale for the inclusion of religious education in the curriculum as outlined in the syllabus. Among the stated aims of religious education are the follow<Col N="335" /> ing: to foster an awareness that the human search for meaning is common to all peoples of all ages and at all times; to explore how this search for meaning has found and continues to find expression in religion; to appreciate the richness of religious traditions and to acknowledge the non-religious interpretation of life.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's question also raises the issue of school attendance. The recommendation of the Council of Europe,<i> inter alia</i>, calls on the Governments of member states to ensure that legislation on the obligation to enrol children at school is rigorously applied and that appropriate authorities intervene in the event of non-compliance. This is entirely in line with the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which provide specifically that children must be enrolled in recognised schools, unless they are receiving an adequate education in another specified-registered setting. The Act also provides for the establishment of a new agency, the National Education Welfare Board, which will play a key role, through its officers, in ensuring that the constitutional rights of children within the specified age groups are delivered in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418, 425, 426 and 430 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grants. The reference value for inflation <Col N="336" /> is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000/01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
    <P>Similarly, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to depart from these indices as a guideline.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year, expenditure on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million. In view of the scale of expenditure involved, and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced, on 11 November, that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I established an action group on access to third level education last September to advise on measures which would tackle under-representation by disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than <Col N="337" /> 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the Finance Act, 1999. A survey by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in September 1999 to gauge the effect of the tax incentives indicated that 7,500 bed spaces were in various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage, rather than an across the board increase in grant levels which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the proposal to which the <Col N="338" /> Deputy refers. My Department's inspectorate is currently pursuing possible arrangements for the establishment of an autism specific educational service for children with autism in the Galway area. As part of this process, one of my Department's inspectors recently met with some of the parents of children with autism in the area. The inspector has also had discussions with representatives of the service providers in the Galway area. The inspector will be submitting a report to my Department in the near future.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a range of new measures to enhance the level and quality of special education services available for children with autism. These measures include: the immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for all children with autism; the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the introduction of these additional measures will make a positive contribution to the development of a satisfactory response to the educational needs of children with autism in the Galway area.</P>

      <P>School management authorities are responsible for the management and usage of spare accommodation in schools. The Deputy may be aware that the Government wishes to prioritise the development of the child care sector and, in particular, to increase the number of child care places available. My Department is working closely with other Departments and agencies with responsibility in this area, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has primary responsibility for the development and implementation of appropriate strategies in relation to child care provision.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently carrying out a survey of spare classroom accommodation in all first and second level schools. The survey information will be relayed to Area Development Management Limited for use in targeting State support to areas most in need of additional child care places. It is envisaged that where suitable school accommodation is identified and confirmed, appropriate supports, including financial assistance, will be made available to bring the additional capacity on stream as quickly as possible. I will make any necessary arrangements to support the use of spare school classrooms in this way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy participated in the recent survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools. Under the new programme, schools found to have the highest concentrations of pupils with characteristics that <Col N="341" /> are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving will be allocated resources that reflect the levels of concentration and the relative needs of pupils at risk. The programme will cost in excess of £25 million over three years and will involve the allocation of 200 new teaching posts and financial assistance to selected schools.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act was enacted on 5 July 2000. The Act itself provides that all of its provisions must be commenced within two years of enactment. The Act provides for the raising of the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16, or the completion of three years of post-primary education, whichever is the later. It also provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Departments. As most of the nominations have now been received I will be in a position to establish the designate board in the near future.</P>

      <P>It is a cause of concern to me that any students, and particularly those in leaving certificate year, are experiencing disruption in their education as a result of the industrial action by the ASTI. The decision by the ASTI to escalate the industrial action to include further strike days and the ban on co-operation with leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations is difficult to understand particularly when the decision came immediately at the end of a week in which the improved terms of the PPF together with the budget tax concessions were accepted by the other public service unions including the other two teacher unions.</P>
      <P>I have written to the ASTI today outlining my views on the dispute and inviting them to meet me so that we can find a way to resolve this dispute in a mutually acceptable and satisfactory way in the interests of the students.</P>

      <P>Resource teachers are allocated to provide teaching support for children with special educational needs arising from a disability, who are fully integrated in mainstream national schools, where there are no other adequate support teaching resources available to the children. The level of resource support is established following consideration of assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals.</P>
      <P>Resource teacher posts may be sanctioned on a full-time basis, either in a single school or in a cluster of schools, provided there are sufficient children with special educational needs arising from a disability to warrant a full-time post. Alternatively, part-time hours may be sanctioned to provide support teaching for individual children or where there are insufficient children with special educational needs to warrant the allocation of a full-time post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has sanctioned the appointment of 500 full-time resource teaching posts and the equivalent of a further 205 posts in part-time <Col N="344" /> hours since October 1998. The estimated cost of this scheme in the current year is £19.1 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to allocate resource teaching support in response to assessed levels of needs.</P>
