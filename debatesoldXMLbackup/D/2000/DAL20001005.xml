      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I take the opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann the Honourable Kandy Nohova, Chairman of the National Council of Namibia, who is here with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. On my own behalf and that of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I extend to you, Mr. Chairman, a most sincere welcome to our country. I trust that your visit will further strengthen the ties of friendship and co-operation between our two parliaments and countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters I would like to raise, the first in regard to promised legislation. The Appropriation Bill has been promised. Will that Bill make extra provision this year for adequate compensation for those who suffer from autism and who have not had their legal rights over a number of years as found by the courts yesterday? Will it contain measures to ensure that we learn from the past and that all children who are being denied a right to education will be given it straight away without hav<Col N="1055" /> ing to go all the way to the Supreme Court to obtain it? Will the Taoiseach deal with this matter as a priority in this year's Appropriation Bill and in this year's Estimates and not next year's or wait for some other court case to be taken by somebody else? </P>
      <P>The second question I would like to&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, if I may.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this is an issue that will attract broad consensus across this House and when we are belatedly recognising the rights of every citizen to have full citizenship &ndash; and that begins with basic education &ndash; will the Taoiseach say whether the Minister for Education and Science will exercise his right under Standing Order 42 to come into the House and make a statement today on the response of the Government to yesterday's judgment in the broadest possible context to ensure that every citizen, whether those suffering from autism or any other disability, will be able to participate fully in the education system and in other systems of this State? That would be a very welcome initiative and perhaps the Minister might reflect on it and accept that he should do that today.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputies Bruton and Howlin, the Government is very conscious of that this is a very serious matter. There is no doubt that, over many decades, the State failed to provide the sort of education for children with special needs which they have a right to receive. We have been trying to develop a system capable of responding in a flexible and professional way. Over the past two years more than 350 specialist teaching posts and more than 800 child care assistants posts for children with special educational needs have been appointed and specialist classes for children with autism are being established in various parts of the country.</P>
      <P>We recognise that we have to do more. The Department is working to do more and the Minister will publish details of a proposal to establish a dedicated special educational support agency which will provide advice and professional support for parents, teachers and schools. In addition, a special task force on education for children with autism will report this month. All of those issues should assist in this case. This judgment will be and is being carefully examined by the Minister for Education and Science. Perhaps today would be too soon to give a reply but I will ask the Minister to reply as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that all Members agree with the fine and eloquent words he has spoken about this case? However, <Col N="1057" /> many would question why Mrs. Sinnott and her son had to spend, I think, 27 days in the High Court fighting the Government to win this judgment and that taxpayers' money was devoted to fighting this case and resisting Jamie Sinnott's claim. Have any lessons been learned? These mistakes have been made in the past and no one is free of criticism. However, we should not fail to learn and we should not go on fighting cases which are eminently just when they could be settled much less expensively and with much less pain. Does the Taoiseach agree that lessons must be learned from this case and that the other 1,000 autistic children should not also have to go to court and go through the same pain and worry of whether they will succeed or lose their homes depending on whether they win the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Bruton and by way of seeking clarification from the Taoiseach, we are all learning from cases such as this. As a society and as a nation we have to change our ways to ensure that we do not put barriers in the way of anyone trying to vindicate basic rights. In welcoming the Taoiseach's commitment that the Minister for Education and Science will make a response, will he make a statement rather than wait for a question under Standing Order 42 at an appropriate time next week? Can we have that commitment?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point being made by Deputies. The case has been going on for years. <Col N="1058" /> It was lodged in the lifetime of other Governments but we should not get into an argument on it. The argument put forward by the Department of Education and Science in this case was that it was offering what it believed to be adequate education but that was not in a primary school, which was what the parents put forward. We have to take account of that. The courts have made their judgment and that has to be looked at in light of the decision in this case and the right of people to be entitled to an education system. That is what the Department was fighting for. The case is over and the judgment is made. We are doings things differently now to what we used to do with special needs. We have moved significantly in recent years but there is still some way to go. It will be addressed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>As regards European policy, is it a deliberate tactic on the part of the Government to imitate the classical figure, Janus, who had two heads facing in opposite directions so that Fianna Fáil MEPs vote against enlargement of the Union while Fianna Fáil Ministers at home, when speaking to ambassadors from applicant countries, say they are in favour of enlargement? Is this a deliberate tactic of speaking out of both sides of one's mouth on Europe, just as the Government does on virtually every other question where there are concerns to be allayed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1996 Act has proven to be one of the most effective legislative measures enacted by these Houses by enabling the forces of law in the State to seize the ill-gotten gains of those involved in serious crime here. It was part of a legislative and operational package put in place with inputs from all sides of this House. I readily acknowledge the role of the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in putting forward his proposals in this regard, which were accepted by the then Government, of which I had the honour to be a member, and were built upon and expanded into an effective package of measures and operational procedures which had such a forceful effect on organised crime. It was the most co-ordinated and effective response to serious crime ever seen here.</P>
      <P>The procedural improvements, which the Minister has brought before the House in this amending Bill, seek to bring about the streamlining of the operation of the existing law regarding the position of clarity and certainty and the tendering of evidence in the course of court applications. All those procedural changes are supported by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996-97 initiatives were effective. Many criminals who operated in the State were <Col N="1066" /> deprived of their loot and many more were put out of business entirely. Some abandoned the State. Unfortunately some now operate criminal activities from outside the jurisdiction, but even that has proven not to be an insurmountable barrier and the forces of law in the State have combined with those in other countries such as the Netherlands to reach out beyond even our statutory borders.</P>
    <P>The work of the Criminal Assets Bureau in particular is to be commended. It is highly regarded at home and abroad. I avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the personnel involved in this difficult and dangerous work. It is no easy task to involve oneself in facing up to the vicious thugs and criminals who are willing to perpetrate viciousness and assault for their own ends. Therefore, those involved deserve our support and will get it from all sides of this House because their work is among the most important work to be done in the criminal justice system in the State.</P>
    <P>I have said that those people have been remarkably successful in tackling a criminal underworld which had developed in this city and in the State. There are two areas, however, which I want to put to the Minister where the Criminal Assets Bureau has not been visibly active and which seem to be tailor made for its intervention. The first is tackling organised crime by proscribed organisations, so-called paramilitaries who are involved in the State in such areas as cross-Border smuggling, racketeering and, indeed, drug-peddling. A variety of proscribed organisations, so-called patriots and others, have been involved in a variety of nefarious activities, all of which impact horrendously on the quality of life of many of the citizens of the State, particularly in the most vulnerable and deprived areas of the cities. These same individuals often present themselves as saviours of working class communities. It is surprising that the effectiveness with which the Criminal Assets Bureau and the other mechanisms which were available to the Garda Síochána and the agencies established have not dealt with this dimension of crime with the same force and effect.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Mandelson, recently said that legislation similar to the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, will be introduced in the UK Parliament, focusing particularly on the paramilitaries which operate within the UK jurisdiction. If that recognition is there, it is surely just as applicable to this jurisdiction and I would welcome a response from the Minister to that issue when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>Another dimension which is increasingly a matter of concern for citizens is the increase in white collar crime. There seems to be a disproportionate focus on what used be called ordinary criminal activity and less on the damaging effect of white collar crime, even the estimate of which is much more damaging in economic terms to the well-being of the State and our ambitions, for <Col N="1067" /> example, of establishing Dublin as a hub for international finance and commence, particularly e-commerce. We are playing a losing game of catch-up in monitoring white collar activity, money-laundering and e-commerce fraud. In recent times some initiatives have been taken on this matter but it is an area on which there does not seem to have been the same focus by the forces of law and order as on the more regular and visible types of criminal activity perpetrated in the State.</P>
    <P>There is a view, because of that lack of focus, that so-called white collar crime is more acceptable even on a huge scale than the petty theft which is focused on by the forces of law. Those two areas, the activities of the paramilitary organisations and the focus on the new types of more subtle, more complicated white collar crime, merit and demand particular attention and focus by the criminal justice system to ensure a common attack on criminal activity of all types and equal treatment for all citizens. There is often a different socio-economic background for those engaged in white collar crime than for those engaged in the more regular types of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>There were remarkable achievements by the criminal justice system under the stewardship of the Minister's predecessor in 1996-97. That progress has been steadily undermined, particularly in the past 12 months. New criminal gangs have grown to replace those that were successfully smashed in 1996-97. These new gangs that have emerged on the criminal scene in Dublin are more vicious, savage and ruthless than those who went before. The Minister, rather notoriously, in a statement some time ago described the current crime rate as akin to the 1950s. The grim catalogue of serious crime, murder, rape, vicious and serious assault and armed robbery, mocks that statement and the Minister's complacency when in the past few months there have been newspaper headlines such as &ldquo;Godfathers of crime &ndash; 13 gang syndicate&rdquo;. This headline referred to a report from the EU Justice and Home Affairs meeting which said there is a 13 gang syndicate operating in a vicious underworld in this State. Litanies of murders, names and circumstances, are printed in our national newspapers. Murder was once regarded as a rare and notorious event and was commented on for months or years. Murder is now a regular event and it does not shock us to the degree it once did. Newspaper headlines read &ldquo;Gangland murderers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Young criminals set up the violence&rdquo;.  There have been the most horrific types of murders involving gangland assassinations, drownings, killings and shootings, the details of which are catalogued in the national newspapers.</P>
    <P>There has also been an increase in street assaults. Some 1,400 victims have been treated for assault in Dublin this year. A newspaper headline such as &ldquo;Gangland killings on the increase&rdquo; is an indication of the new upsurge in viciousness that <Col N="1068" /> has been allowed take place particularly in the past 12 months. The success achieved in 1996-97, when the will of this Parliament mirrored the will of the people and a determination by the forces of law, the divisions of An Garda Síochána, was remarkable but has not been maintained. The criminal underworld has pushed its way back. That stands as an indictment to the complacency of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The willingness of the last Administration, of which I had the honour to be a member, to accept good ideas and bold initiatives from any quarter in our common battle&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely untrue. It is disingenuous of the Deputy to say that. I shall catalogue the measures we brought before the House in this Dáil which were voted down by the Government. This is not a partisan issue. Nobody has a monopoly of wisdom. This is a parliament. In a parliament good ideas which are for the public good should be accepted by the Dáil. There was a willingness in the last Administration that had a clear majority to accept good ideas and to acknowledge them. I have already acknowledged them in my contribution. The fingerprints and hallmark of the current Minister from the Opposition benches are there to his credit. Because he walked across the hallway to sit on the Government side does not mean any person who sits on this side has no good ideas and that he must find an argument to vote them down because they were not his. I regard it as the hallmark of a good Minister to accept good ideas from any quarter rather than to be conceited and arrogant enough to believe that only ideas authored by himself or herself have merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a common objective as parliamentarians to provide the basis of law that will allow our citizens to go about their lawful business without let or hindrance, without fear, and in safety. That is one of our primary responsibilities. Above all, that responsibility falls on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Yet any initiative, no matter how worthy, even when supported by the Minister's backbenches and colleagues, is voted down by him if authored by Members from the Opposition. That is a sign of inadequacy. A view often entertained by Departments is that if it does not come from the confines of the Department it is, by definition, flawed. A strong and good Minister overcomes that and understands the principles of a parliamentary democracy. We do not run our business by executive authority. Parliament disposes, Ministers propose. Members can also propose. A willing, good and efficient Minister accepts good ideas. For example, the Labour Party Bill dealing with joyriding was an extremely important measure to tackle an important issue for the streets of Dublin. Deputy Keaveney may not be familiar with joyriding as an issue in her area of <Col N="1069" /> Donegal. In Dublin it is a very serious issue that impacts catastrophically on the lives of a huge number of citizens here. It is not a joke or a laughing matter. That proposal from the Labour Party benches was strongly supported by a phalanx of Dublin Fianna Fáil Deputies. Yet they were whipped to vote against it. We have seen no alternative from the Minister. He could have accepted the Labour Party Bill and it would be the law of the land by now.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Deputy Higgins of Fine Gael proposed a Bill dealing with enforcement of court orders. That was killed off by the Minister not because it was without merit but because the idea was not his. That is an indictment and a negation of the rights of Parliament. All of us filter the views of the people and what should emerge is a consensus of views. There is no monopoly of wisdom on either side.</P>
    <P>While the Minister adopts that arrogant position, the promises he made in Opposition now stand hollow and empty. The Minister no longer dares to speak the words &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo;, a phrase that evokes hollow laughs in the media and among people when set against his record. Zero tolerance, as explained by the Minister when he was in Opposition, meant all offences and misdemeanours would be acted on. There would be no exclusions under the law and all people would be treated equally. I doubt that even the Minister is brazen necked enough now to suggest that his record could demonstrate that this was the policy implemented by the Administration in the last three years.</P>
    <P>There is much to do in the reform of our criminal justice system. A remarkable start was made under the previous Administration when we looked at, under the stewardship of the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, the creation of a number of agencies to run the courts and prison services, to be responsible and accountable and to bring to the administration of justice the ideas of accountability that were demanded in every sector of public life. We sought to bring transparency to all aspects of the justice system, to improve its responsiveness to public need and to make it more effective.</P>
    <P>There is much to do because those ideas have progressed slowly. I do not have a huge criticism to make in that regard because it is difficult to establish a new courts system through a new administration. It is also constitutionally difficult to provide the degree of accountability in the courts system that the citizens of this country require and demand. However, we must be responsive to those needs. It is our job, as legislators, to deal with them effectively and well.</P>
    <P>Later today my parliamentary question relating to judicial accountability will be dealt with. I will be interested to hear the Minister's response. However, it is certainly a requirement now, whether with regard to An Garda Síochána, the operation of the Judiciary, the operation of the prosecutorial services or the operation of the Department, that transparent, accountable and <Col N="1070" /> consistent decisions are made which can be justified and accepted by the people through this Parliament and its committees. We need to work more quickly and enthusiastically to bring about effective transparency.</P>
    <P>In that context, the measure before the House is small. It seeks to improve the armoury of the forces of law. The Labour Party willingly supports this amending legislation. We want to give to the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Síochána whatever equipment, supports, clarity and legal measures are required to do their jobs effectively. For that reason we have no difficulty accepting this small set of technical amendments to the 1996 Act and supporting it on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill. It was the current Minister who, in 1996, introduced his organised crime, restraint and disposal of illicit assets Bill which the Government of the day had no option but to accept because matters had got so badly out of hand. The Bill was subsequently renamed the Proceeds of Crime Act. If that Bill had not been introduced, today's amendment would not be before the House.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the tremendous work he is doing. I listened to Deputy Howlin extol the virtues of the previous Minister but she did not have the initiative to deal with this serious issue. I do not have her record to hand but one can assume that with 34 legislative measures on the Statute Book since 1997 or more than 40% of all legislation introduced by this Government, with several more measures due to come before the Oireachtas and with 13 Private Members' motions introduced by the Minister when he was an Opposition Deputy, three of which were accepted, it is disingenuous of Deputy Howlin to claim nothing is happening and that the Minister is sitting on his hands. The opposite is the case.</P>
      <P>We are discussing a relatively small but important amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. It will ensure that one of the most historic Bills to come before the House from the justice Department is brought to an even higher level of effectiveness and efficiency. That is solely due to the work and authorship of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Criminal Assets Bureau is being replicated in various parts of Europe. Our example has set the headline for Europe and other member states are trying to catch up with us. This morning on the Order of Business the Government was accused of being anti-European and against anything that represented progress, but we are leading the way with the Criminal Assets Bureau and not playing catch up, what many people appear to believe is Ireland's role. I congratulate the Minister in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Proceeds of Crime Bill the criminal's assets could be sequestered and their bank accounts investigated. The assets of people who appeared to be living beyond their means and to <Col N="1071" /> have untold wealth from unknown sources could now be frozen. The legislation prevented them from disposing of their assets before questions could be asked. Between its inception in October 1996 and 31 December 1998, the Criminal Assets Bureau succeeded in having assets to the value of £10 million frozen under the Proceeds of Crime Act, demanded in excess of £19 million in tax payments and saved almost £1 million in social welfare payments. This cannot be underestimated as an important element of dealing with crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always operated on the basis that there is correlation between crime and social deprivation and that the drugs problem cannot be solved by law enforcement measures alone. We must deal not only with the person and his or her assets but also go behind the scenes and deal with the situation which allows people to command such assets and become heavily involved in the huge drugs culture.</P>
    <P>Crime should not pay and this legislation will close many loopholes. I come from the Border region of Inishowen in County Donegal and the cross-Border element of crime and criminal assets is most important. I am pleased the UK is moving in the same direction. However, there must be increased cross-Border co-operation. We live close to the huge urban centre of Derry and to one of the fastest growing towns in Europe, Letterkenny. Crime is present in every big centre in every country, even though Deputy Howlin would make anyone feel that it is strange to have crime in Ireland. Very few places are free from crime which is a particular issue in larger urban centres. We are located close to the big urban centres of Derry and Letterkenny and I would like that problem to be recognised. Unfortunately, we are touched by the drugs problem the same as everywhere else in the country. We are not the quiet little backwater some people may believe and it is very important for that to be recognised.</P>
    <P>Many young people in the area are working very hard to steer along the right path. Many people in areas like Letterkenny, such as Councillor Blake and others, are involved voluntarily in the national drugs strategy team and the local drugs task forces. I again congratulate the Minister on the level of support we are beginning to receive through him, together with the Taoiseach's involvement in the Cabinet sub-committee and the involvement of the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, in getting support, advice and finances through to the local task forces. This is where changes can be made. Some £10 million has currently been made available to help implement 200 projects proposed by local task forces and it is very important that this continues. Most projects are effective when they are as close as possible to the source of the problem. The local task forces are on the ground and are very aware of the needs of their areas. I hope this idea will be expanded. A superintendent was appointed to liaise with the Border drugs team <Col N="1072" /> concept and perhaps the Minister will let me know how this concept has advanced or if there are plans to expand it. The concept is very necessary and will have a big bearing on places like my constituency which, because of their proximity to the large urban centres, could fall victim to more serious crime levels in future. Many of these areas are outside our jurisdictional control at present.</P>
    <P>Many young people are getting into crime and can probably be best helped by people like my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy McDaid. I congratulate him on the level of funding which he is providing to County Donegal. For the first time in many years we are receiving real funding. This is providing facilities that did not exist in the past for people who if unchecked would have ended up being the big barons of the drugs industry which the Bill is targeting. Young people should be given alternatives to hanging around and finding themselves with so little to do that they become involved in activities that may initially have minor consequences but may lead to greater difficulties.</P>
    <P>I listened to a radio programme yesterday involving young joyriders. I wish to clarify for Deputy Howlin that even in Donegal we know what a joyrider is. The young joyriders to whom I listened said they have become involved in community activities and community clubs. Community leaders deserve extra support. We should put a community leader into every region and every small area because community leaders are in touch with young people and keep them involved in more constructive activities than they would otherwise become involved in if left to their own devices. Those who spoke on the radio yesterday were former joyriders and were given an alternative which they found interesting. They decided to give up joyriding because they would have lost the opportunity to go horse-riding, get involved in adventure sports or whatever activity the club leader was providing. If these people in the heart of Dublin who were able to find an alternative to going out joyriding can be dealt with, joyriders can be dealt with throughout the country. I stress the value of local sporting facilities, facilities where people can congregate, and the value of having paid community leaders. Many community leaders are working on a voluntary basis at present. This service should be better organised and these people should be given a proper role.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on tackling the issue of under age drinking about which I have been very vocal in the past. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, introduced the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and did not hide around the corner like earlier Ministers for Justice. Many people talked the good talk but did not walk the walk. The Minister did so and introduced a Bill that no one in the industry believed he would. He is dealing with the very serious issue of under age drinking. I hope every effort will be made to ensure the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is fully implemented. I would like to think the Minister will monitor the success of <Col N="1073" /> the Bill, particularly the under age drinking section, because even in rural Ireland petty crime is leading to petty vandalism which, in turn, is leading to more serious vandalism. This can lead to vicious crime and, if it is not dealt with, it can lead to people getting away with committing minor offences and moving to more serious crime. We should consider seriously the use of ID cards and promote them as best we can. They should be available free of charge and reviewed.</P>
    <P>There should be pilot schemes for role modelling in schools and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should co-operate with the Department of Education and Science in developing this. Young people who start to drink from the age of ten upwards are very susceptible to the influence of pop stars, football stars, some sporting or local hero. Such potential role models reside in every area and could have a positive effect on small children in the local schools. They could give young people someone to look up to, someone who can survive and enjoy a night out without drinking. I have had experience of people offering to become such role models. These opportunities should not be wasted but should be pursued.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is considering the issue of juvenile liaison officers. Under the national development plan, funding amounting to approximately £87 million will be made available to cover crime prevention measures. This is the first time the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has received substantial funds to undertake programmes which will be designed to assist children at risk of becoming involved in crime and those who have already come into contact with the criminal justice system. We should look at the juvenile diversion programmes in particular to see whether they are effective and decide if we can co-ordinate a better strategy.</P>
    <P>Young people need to be assessed educationally and in terms of training. Their future employment prospects and their proper integration into society must also be examined. Those who have come into contact with juvenile liaison officers have tended to stray only a little but there are not enough officers. Some people believe the scheme does not work. Statistics highlight, however, that offenders who take up the programme early tend not to re-offend. The scheme is not ideal, but it has great potential.</P>
    <P>The Garda's motto has always been &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo;. Prevention can work if gardaí are visible on the beat dealing with young people in the community and building up relationships. It would be a good start if one officer in every Garda station was assigned to juvenile liaison activity. Many gardaí are involved in the voluntary sector outside their daily work and are involved in GAA, soccer and boxing clubs. In terms of prevention this could help the State to avoid spending money on cures later.</P>
    <P>There are young people in north Donegal who have gone beyond underage drinking, vandalism and stealing and burning cars to the stage where <Col N="1074" /> many people have identified this small section of our community as candidates for Mountjoy Prison in the near future. They need a great deal of support to help themselves. There is a vacuum in certain parts of the country into which a great deal of the money which the Minister has at its disposal could be channelled to deal with such young people who are candidates for involvement in serious crime in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>A huge proportion of young people in Inishowen leave school early. The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, recognised that and provided funding to deal with the problem. Some early school leavers are taking up employment but others are going astray. They could be taken in hand through psychological assessment and the provision of proper support for them and their families. There is probably legislation in the pipeline that will outline what should happen to these people but I would like action to be taken on the ground.</P>
    <P>Some young people who have been in serious trouble have decided after a while that they want to get back on the straight and narrow. I recently heard some of them on a radio programme who had been diagnosed with ADD and ADHD. However, they get into trouble and when that happens nobody wants to know them. They cannot get back into the education system and are stuck for somewhere to go. They are not given the second chance opportunities that are always piloted and recommended in the education system.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do what he can in terms of North-South co-operation. Crime is advancing in the bigger urban centres in the North, particularly Derry. We are taking the brunt of it in north Donegal because we are on the Border. Criminals from the North are chancing their arms as they travel further into north Donegal. They used to operate near the Border but are now travelling 20 or 30 miles to break in to houses and escape with money and goods. Good and strong co-operation is needed on both sides of the Border and gardaí must be visible in the communities.</P>
    <P>I recently raised the issue of equipment with the Minister and he will address it. Donegal is a large county and if basic Garda equipment and personnel are not provided we will get nowhere. That is contrary to everything the Minister has done because he has led the way in tackling crime in terms of bringing in legislation and putting control back into the hands of those who can enforce it. I ask the Minster to keep in mind Border areas, such as north Donegal, which people believe are quiet little backwaters. They are not and crime could potentially get out of hand in these areas, particularly if the cross-Border criminal element is not pursued more vigorously than at present. Links have been established and I fully endorse a cross-Border relationship between both police forces. There is a great deal of crime in north Donegal because it runs along the Border.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for tightening up this <Col N="1075" /> important legislation which will affect those who are most heavily involved in crime. The Minister should also keep in mind, as he has done, those who are starting out on a career of crime. I hope they never get to the stage whether they will be prosecuted under this legislation.</P>

      <P>This is a short Bill aimed at fine tuning aspects of the 1996 Act to ensure that it will be as effective as was intended in the fight against criminals retaining assets acquired from proceeds of unlawful activity. It has been pointed out that there are specific problems with the interpretation of certain aspects of the original Act which are dealt with in this legislation. The Minister clarified the purpose of the legislation in his contribution in June and I have no problems with what he said in regard to the need to clarify the question that has been raised about who is legally in possession of or who has responsibility for a criminal's assets following a court order to freeze them.</P>
      <P>The Garda does not want that responsibility when an asset can be frozen for up to seven years. However, the original owner must not be allowed to sell or devalue it. The Bill deals with the legal framework around these issues successfully. The purpose of the original legislation was to allow the High Court to order the freezing of the assets of certain criminals with a view to possibly disposing of them at a later date for the eventual benefit of the State. It meant that the Garda was no longer powerless against individuals who displayed wealth and a lifestyle that was clearly beyond their legitimate means. This not only ensures a financial punishment for the criminal involved, but also satisfies the public and the Garda that the system allows them to return some of the proceeds of crime to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As a result of the 1996 Act the Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful in seizing proceeds of criminal activity. Since 1996 court orders have been issued to freeze property to the value of almost £15 million. Demands for tax payments to the Revenue, interests payments and savings on social welfare payments for persons involved in crime have amounted to more than £1.5 million in the same period. The legal framework to allow this process to continue successfully has been recognised internationally as a success story in the fight against organised crime. On behalf of my party, I compliment everybody involved in that fight. As Deputy Howlin said, it is not a pleasant fight and the individuals with which one has to deal in combating organised crime are particularly dangerous and nasty characters. For that reason, I compliment everyone involved in the work against such individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> When the Minister spoke on the Bill in June, he used the opportunity to comment on the battle against drugs and the measures being put in place to deal with juvenile crime, much of which is linked to drug and alcohol abuse. We are now experiencing a growing problem with the breakdown of public order in our large towns and cities. This was particularly the case during the summer, and is so now at night and over weekend periods. During the summer months there was increased media awareness of, and sometimes hype about, street violence. However, there has also been a genuine increase in the number of unprovoked and vicious attacks over the past three or four months. Reading newspaper headlines over the summer months one could be forgiven for wondering what city or country those stories referred to. There were headlines such as &ldquo;Crazy night of stabbings, shootings and petrol bombs&rdquo;, followed by an article describing Dublin city on a Saturday night. Other headlines have included: &ldquo;Huge increase in number of violent attacks&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Street violence takes its toll as fear escalates amongst the public&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Such headlines seem strange following a recent report that the number of assaults and violent attacks is apparently decreasing. In the past three or four months I attended forums both in Dublin and Cork to discover the facts about the levels of street violence. I did not believe the figures from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which suggest that they are not on the increase. The reason for that disparity, however, is that many such crimes go unreported due to the time at which they take place and the circumstances surrounding them.</P>
    <P>I wish to offer some possible solutions to the problems of street violence and attacks in general, which I hope the Minister will consider. The forums I visited were attended by representative groups from many different sectors of the community concerned about street violence. These included parents' groups, vintners, taxi drivers, night-club owners, minority groups such as the gay and lesbian community, the security industry, student bodies representing students in Cork and Dublin, other youth groups and hospital doctors. Everybody seemed to agree that the level of violent attacks is on the increase. Perhaps more importantly, people stressed that the viciousness of these attacks was also increasing. This point was made in particular by representatives of Victim Support.</P>
    <P>Victim Support dealt with over 3,500 cases in the first six months of this year. Over the summer months the organisation expressed serious concern at the failure to control unprovoked assaults which are mainly taking place against males in the 16 to 25 age group. The age profile of those involved in assaults seems to be coming down all the time, which is a worrying factor. A young man of 16 or 17 who has lost control of himself on a Saturday night may, some years later, become a <Col N="1077" /> more dangerous person who is consequently more difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to be over-dramatic, many young people are now afraid to go into towns and city centres. I am speaking in the main about Cork and Dublin as those are the areas I know best. Parents also are afraid to allow their children to go into city centres at night. Many parents have told me they cannot sleep at night until they hear their sons or daughters coming home and closing the door behind them, which can often be 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister examined the real causes of the breakdown of public order in towns and cities? He is attempting to tackle the issue of underage drinking, but in attempting to introduce an ID or age card system why did the Minister not make it compulsory? What is the objection to making ID cards compulsory for young people? If we want to ensure that proprietors of pubs, off-licences and nightclubs take on their responsibilities, as they must under the new legislation, why can we not provide them with the obvious aid of ensuring that every young person who wants to purchase drink has an ID card? That is how it is done in the United States, Canada and many European countries. It makes no sense to introduce the age card system on a voluntary basis. I cannot understand it, so perhaps the Minister can clarify why that has been done.</P>
    <P>We must also seek reasons for the breakdown in respect among young people for authority. I am all for offering young people independence and responsibility but we must also examine the issues of parenting, teaching and religion to try to find solutions to the problem whereby many young people are out of control when outside the family home. Unfortunately, they are sometimes out of control inside the home as well.</P>
    <P>We must examine the issue of drunkenness. Many people have rightly focused on the use of hard drugs and recreational drugs as creating a potential for violent attacks. However, from my experience and having spoken to many people about the issue, alcohol is by far the biggest reason many young people go out of control late at night. We must raise awareness and increase the responsibility of those who sell drink and those who consume it, whether that is done through education, policing or enforcement. One way or the other we must reduce the quantity of alcohol that is consumed as well as reducing its strength.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also has a responsibility to co-operate with other Departments on the question of public transport and taxis. A massive marketing effort has been undertaken to encourage young people to socialise in towns and cities at night. No such effort has been made, however, to try to get them home again afterwards. The Government has not dealt satisfactorily with the issue of providing late night bus services or a proper taxi system and, thus, people cannot get home as quickly as they wish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I would like to see an increase in the Garda presence on the beat, to which Deputy Keaveney referred. There is no substitute for Garda personnel walking on the beat through towns and city centres at night, moving people on before trouble arises.</P>
    <P>Long-term solutions to this problem probably lie in education and in reform of the juvenile justice system. I agree with Deputy Keaveney when she says that we need to provide proper role models for young people to ensure they do not get caught up in a vicious cycle of crime and the revolving door syndrome that, unfortunately, our prison service provides. Crime should not pay and this short Bill goes some way towards ensuring that it does not. The assets of criminals, who do not deserve them, will be seized by the State and I welcome the fact that the resulting money will be used for projects in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for sharing his time. I welcome the Bill which is technical legislation. It will tighten up aspects of the Act introduced in 1996. It is important that aspects of that Act are tightened up to ensure that criminals do not have any opportunity to avail of legal loopholes.</P>
      <P>The original Act was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Owen, who was much maligned when she was Minister for Justice. The 1996 Act was historic and brave legislation and I compliment Deputy Owen and the then Government on having the courage and foresight to introduce it. I also congratulate the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who have played a great role in tackling organised crime over the past number of years. Given the roles played by all those arms of State, organised crime has been dealt a severe blow.</P>
      <P>A next door neighbour of mine, Mr. Paul Williams, is the crime correspondent for the <i>Sunday World</i> and he has done much brave work in journalism by outing criminals and organised crime in Ireland. He did this long before the Criminal Assets Bureau was established or other journalists, who also had the courage of their convictions, pursued and exposed such individuals. They must be complimented on the important public service role they have played.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, much of the legislation was introduced following the tragic shooting of Veronica Guerin. However, even today, many of the crime correspondents put their lives at risk when they investigate the atrocities that some individuals have committed. These journalists also play an important role in the ongoing battle against organised crime. I wish all those involved in that battle continued success because if we are seen to be soft on organised crime, it would cause major difficulties for the country. The view in other countries is that as a result of the legislation that has been introduced Ireland is not a safe haven <Col N="1079" /> for people who wish to pervert the course of justice or become involved in organised crime.</P>
    <P>Other issues pertain to crime and many of my colleagues referred to juvenile, drug related and alcohol related crime. I wish to reiterate some of those points. My firm belief is that much of the crime committed at weekends by young people is alcohol related. Many children first take alcohol at the age of 14 or 15 and by the time they reach the age of 17, they are using soft drugs. The Minister introduced legislation to deal with late drinking and the liquor industry but I agree with Deputy Coveney that a major omission in that Act, which should be rectified urgently, is provision for a national identity card scheme.</P>
    <P>I was raised in a family run public house and I understand the practical difficulties involved in trying to ascertain whether a person is over the age of 18. The only way this problem can be resolved or that a publican or nightclub owner can be prosecuted properly is through a national identity card scheme. As it stands, there are voluntary ID schemes, but we are all aware of stories where 16 year olds gave false dates of birth. If the youth hands in such an ID card to a publican, a nightclub owner or a person working behind a bar, there is nothing that person can do; he or she must accept the card. This problem can only be addressed practically through the introduction of a national identity card scheme.</P>
    <P>I have called for such a scheme since I was elected to the House, but no Government has yet introduced it. I hope the Minister will introduce a national identity card scheme as a matter of urgency because it would play an important role in the fight against underage drinking. My firm belief is that underage drinking is the cause of much violent crime in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Another issue which must be considered is the regulation of fast food outlets at weekends. If one speaks to gardaí in provincial and larger towns, one is told that many young people gather outside fast food outlets after discos and much of the trouble flares there. I am not sure if regulations can be introduced regarding the closing times of such outlets, but this aspect should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Coveney said, it is time to consider putting more gardaí on the beat. Their presence prevents much crime, although I appreciate it is impossible to police every nook and cranny. However, the level of violent and juvenile crime in towns and cities over the summer was frightening. Many of these attacks were on tourists and more gardaí on the beat are needed. Such a move would be supported by the public.</P>
    <P>Sligo town, which is in my constituency, is a large provincial town. The amount of unreported crime that has taken place there over the past number of years is frightening. If one speaks to young people, one is told that they are afraid to go into town at weekends because of the number of attacks. I call on the Minister to introduce a CCTV scheme in Sligo town as a matter of urgency. I read in the newspapers that the Minister will provide funding <Col N="1080" /> for CCTV systems in eight or ten towns and cities and I ask him to give Sligo town priority in that regard. Such systems and more gardaí on the beat would play an important role in reducing crime levels on our streets.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act is very good legislation. It is right and proper that the State now has the power to question people who commit and gain from crime and who cannot prove where they got their wealth, and to take their money and property from them. I hope when more people are working in this area we will also be able to deal with petty criminals. Many of them live on social welfare in housing estates, yet they have new Mercedes cars and second homes. There is no evidence to show where they got their wealth, but we all know where they got it. They sell drugs in housing estates and commit crimes in towns and villages. In the past the gardaí did not have the power to ask the right questions to ascertain where and how they got their resources. This Bill must be welcomed for allowing them to do that.</P>
      <P>Last year 81,274 crimes were committed, of which approximately 42% were detected. That left approximately 1,000 per week which were not detected. In County Mayo 794 crimes were committed, of which 336 or 42% were detected. That means that for every two crimes committed in Mayo &ndash; I am talking about robberies and crimes causing criminal damage &ndash; one was detected. There is something wrong with those figures. Those are the crimes which were reported. I know people whose property and cars were damaged but who did not notify the gardaí because they felt the perpetrators would not be caught and they were only wasting their time. The unreported crime can be added to the total figure.</P>
      <P>People have become more violent. I know the statistics show that crime is reducing, but the crimes being committed have become more violent. I heard previous speakers talk about gardaí on the beat. Both you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I live in a rural area and it is lovely to see a garda walking around a town either at 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. There should be more gardaí on the beat. I know a scheme is being introduced to take gardaí away from administrative duties in the stations and to employ civil servants. That is good because the more gardaí there are on the streets the more it will stop people from committing crime.</P>
      <P>No Government has ever tackled the problem of allowing fast food outlets in every village and town to stay open until 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. If 500 or 600 people congregate around them, it will lead to rows and violence. I cannot understand why we allow people to trade at such hours in the morning. I have been a member of a local authority for 20 years and I have often been criticised for making such comments, but I have always stood my ground. When people look for planning permission from the council, I always insist they should not be allowed to trade after 12 midnight. That is only now beginning to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> When people leave nightclubs at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. and go to fast food outlets, rows develop, windows are broken, cars are damaged and people end up in hospital. The gardaí, doctors and the ambulance service are called to the scene and hospitals become crowded, particularly at weekends. It is time the Government introduced legislation to stop these people from trading at these hours. There is no need for places such as Burger King to be open at such hours when people tend to gather outside them.</P>
    <P>I have seen this happen in Westport. One establishment is open until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. every Friday, Saturday and Sunday or as long as there is someone prepared to buy a burger. There is not a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night without a row and the people living in that area cannot get a night's sleep. People are entitled under the law to a night's sleep when they go to bed at 12 midnight and get up at a reasonable hour. These people should be protected.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has introduced a new proposal that if an unruly pupil causes trouble in a school, he or she can engage a barrister to assist him or her. He or she will be helped, but what will happen to the other 30 students in the school whom he or she has interrupted and upset and whose education has been ruined? How will they and the teachers be protected? That is what is wrong in this country.</P>
    <P>The do gooders always condemn every Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when they come to power. They have all the answers. However, they always live in Dublin 4 or on a greenfield site in the best places in the west, south or east. They do not live in the middle of a housing estate or a town where there is a problem. They will go to public meetings and lecture politicians and Ministers about the rights of criminals. What about the rights of the people who do not commit crime and who want to be protected by the State? No one seems to fight for their rights. However, the criminal must always be looked after.</P>
    <P>This issue also arises in relation to jails. Criminals there must always be given the best treatment. It reminds me of the mother who came to me recently complaining about her son being locked up and asking why she could not visit him three or four days a week. I asked her if she realised that her son had gone to prison and not to Hotel Westport. People must realise that if someone commits a crime they are not put into a hotel but prison, that there are restrictions and that someone else is in charge. The reason they are in prison is that they have committed a crime. They have either injured someone or damaged someone's property. Mammies and daddies must realise that if their sons or daughters have committed a crime they must pay the penalty and that they are not going to a hotel but to jail.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify if people who commit crimes, whether they have been caught for drink driving or fined for not having tax or insurance, and who are on low incomes can <Col N="1082" /> pay such fines through their social welfare payments. A court case was taken recently against a former Minister for Justice. When a judge fines a man on social welfare £500 or £600 for being drunk and disorderly, the court clerk sends out the order and the gardaí call to the house for the money owing to the State. However, his wife and family suffer because he will not change his ways and she will have to make the payment. I am not a legal person but I say to the judges, there is no point fining someone £600 or £700 if they are on social welfare of £100 or £150 a week. That does not make sense. There must be another way for these people to pay their debt to society. There was a time when Ministers had discretion to overturn judges' decisions but the court has recently decided that Ministers cannot interfere. I tabled a number of questions to him in the Dáil and in all fairness to him he has been consistent. He has not overturned any of these fines.</P>
    <P>I am not saying people who commit a crime should not pay for it. They should pay for it but there is little point in putting further pressure on families or on husbands or wives. The husband may not care whether a fine is paid but the family will not want to see the husband going to jail so it is the wife who will have to scrape together the money from the social welfare payment. She is the one who will have to go out and borrow or beg to pay it. Is there another way out of this problem whereby people on social welfare could be given some community work to do or whereby they could make a phased payment rather than having to pay £600 or £700 which is not possible and which tends to create many problems? It is also blocking up the whole system.</P>
    <P>I am glad the State is at last dealing with the drug barons and the people who have committed serious crime here. These people now know that if they are profiting from the sale of drugs or other illegal activity and have big houses and other wealth, even though they may be on social welfare, the State can move in. That is a good development and it is great to see so many of the major criminals behind bars, which is where they should be.</P>
    <P>The people who commit petty crime also hurt many people. Last Christmas Eve, a window in my own property in Westport was smashed and I spent the day trying to get somebody to repair it. The man who broke it did not come back to ask me how much he owed me. The first person to come forward to protect him was his mother, who said he did not mean it, yet the same man was in court again last week for some other reason. These people do not learn. They have to learn through justice. There is only one place for people who commit petty crime and that is behind bars.</P>
    <P>I agree with the &ldquo;do gooders&rdquo; that everybody is entitled to a chance but if they do not reform themselves having got a number of chances, the only place for them is behind bars. The &ldquo;do gooders&rdquo; should remember that there are not enough prison spaces. Many people who commit serious <Col N="1083" /> crime remain undetected. I hope the police catch up with these people and put them behind bars.</P>

        <b>: </b>I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue, and I compliment the Minister because for a long time Ireland was seen as a safe haven for organised crime. In fairness to different Governments and different Ministers for Justice, it is always difficult to deal effectively with an island nation. With vast miles of coastline, it is easy to gain access to a country like Ireland to peddle drugs and become engaged in other money making rackets.</P>
      <P>The late Veronica Guerin was mentioned earlier in the debate. Following her death, politicians and all those in authority here sat up and took notice because organised crime was taking over. I am glad that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has continued to deal effectively with the drug barons and the problem of organised crime and I hope he will continue to be tough in his dealings with those problems in the future.</P>
      <P>As Ireland gets richer and everyone is better off, does anyone care any more? We seem to be becoming a greedy and selfish nation concerned only about ourselves. Respect for authority seems to be going out the window. Perhaps it is my imagination but young people seem to be far more aggressive nowadays. They certainly have more money in their pockets. They are spending more money on drink at weekends and frequently become involved in rows. There no longer appears to be any respect for gardaí, teachers or the clergy. We hear so much these days about the rights of the wrong-doers but very little about the rights of the people who are attacked or, in some cases, killed and those whose property is vandalised.</P>
      <P>Murder now seems to be accepted as the norm here. I know the Minister does not accept it as the norm but 20 years ago, if a murder happened in a village or a town there would be ferocious criticism but people do not seem to care any more. In Ireland today, very little value is placed on life. That is not the Ireland we grew up in, and it is certainly not the Ireland we want to see for the future. Almost every day on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or in the newspapers we hear or read about a person who has been murdered in some town or a village. That is not acceptable and it needs to be dealt with. It is not easy for a Minister to deal with it. People have to deal with this problem and more value has to be placed on life than currently is the case in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in Wexford, very close to Rosslare Harbour, and we have first-hand knowledge of the drugs problem and the drug barons who try to bring drugs through Rosslare. In the past week, the customs people apprehended drugs coming in through Rosslare to the value of £1 million. I compliment the customs people and the gardaí at Rosslare for their vigilance and the way they accost people coming through on a regular basis. One must look seriously at places such as <Col N="1084" /> Rosslare and ensure that there are more customs people and a greater Garda presence in such ports because the drugs coming through Rosslare will help to create the criminals of tomorrow. They will also devastate families and the young people who become hooked on drugs. Total vigilance in our ports is very important to ensure that few, if any, drugs get through.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem in housing estates is no longer confined to Dublin. It is now evident in villages and towns throughout rural Ireland. I am regularly baffled that people from housing estates in communities are able to tell me as a politician that Joe Soap is selling drugs in a certain housing estate, yet the Garda do not seem to be able to deal with people selling drugs. The Garda tell me they visit the house named but are unable to find drugs, yet later that night these people are out on the streets selling the drugs again. Legislation should be introduced whereby the Garda should be able to arrest people known to sell drugs although they may be able to hide them effectively from gardaí on their visits to housing estates. They are doing serious damage to young people living in housing estates in towns and villages in rural Ireland. The problems that were confined to Dublin ten years ago are now visiting rural Ireland and it is time to deal with the small drug barons, as I call them, in the smaller towns and villages.</P>
    <P>There was much talk earlier about what are becoming serious problems in towns at weekends. The Minister extended the drinking hours. I had reservations about extending the drinking hours because of what I see happening in Wexford, Enniscorthy and Gorey at weekends where up to 1,000 people are dumped out on the streets from nightclubs at 3 o'clock and 3.30 in the morning. They go to the local chipper or restaurant but most of the time many of the young people are drunk and, more often than not, a row will break out. The number of cowardly attacks in the smaller towns on weekends is escalating. The gardaí are doing their best to deal with the problem but they cannot be everywhere on the one night. Under age drinking in nightclubs is a major problem that has to be dealt with effectively. ID cards go some way towards addressing the problem but they will not solve it. Nightclub owners have a major responsibility in this area. During the week they advertise the acts that will take place in their clubs on Friday and Saturday nights and at 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday mornings they let young people out on to the streets, having ripped them off by charging high prices, and do not care how they get home or what happens to them.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking is a serious problem. Communities in the smaller towns are starting to take action. They are calling public meetings, asking to attend council meetings and visiting the local gardaí and superintendents to ascertain what can be done to address this problem. Some communities are paying for the installation of cameras to protect themselves from young offenders. It is not <Col N="1085" /> good enough that people who live over shops or in houses in the centre of towns should be subjected to shouting, harassment and abuse at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. at the weekends.</P>
    <P>Such behaviour seems to be the new culture. Everyone has more money to spend, but sanity must prevail. While I accept it is not an easy problem to resolve, nightclub owners, publicans, gardaí and the local community must get together to investigate how to resolve it. It will cause politicians and the gardaí major headaches because communities are not prepared to put up with it.</P>
    <P>Many of the cowardly attacks on young people are drink related. A number of people walking home on their own in Enniscorthy have been attacked and beaten by gangs of young men and gangs of young women, with some of the attackers being as young as 13 or 14. It has got to the stage in Enniscorthy that a young person more often than not will not walk home alone for fear of being attacked. Cameras have been installed in a number of streets in the town to ascertain how this problem can be dealt with. It is a disgrace that people as young as 14 are out at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. at the weekends attacking genuine decent people making their way home after a night out. It reflects a lack of parental control. Parents have become too soft.</P>
    <P>People talk about the need for a greater Garda presence on our streets. While that is important, I do not support a policy of a single garda patrolling the streets at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., as such a garda could also be attacked. There is a need for more Garda cars and a re-arrangement of Garda structures. Perhaps fewer gardaí are needed in our towns from Monday to Thursday and a greater garda presence is needed from Thursday night to Sunday night when there tends to be a major congregation of young people. The Minister should discuss such a re-arrangement of Garda personnel with superintendents and chief superintendent to deal effectively with this problem.</P>
    <P>The superintendents and chief superintendents who report to the Garda Commissioner do not always tell the truth to the Minister of the day regardless of who he or she may be. When I make representations to the Minister about the need for extra gardaí and extra facilities for gardaí in parts of County Wexford more often than not I get a letter back stating that, having consulted the Commissioner, who in turn has consulted the local chief superintendent, the Minister is satisfied that the area is adequately served. When I show such letters to the local gardaí, they laugh and say, &ldquo;the superintendent is looking for promotion or the chief superintendent wants to go up the line and he will not upset anyone further up&rdquo;. The Minister needs to get more in tune with what is happening on the ground. I am not saying he is not in tune with everything that is happening, but some of the information being fed up the line by superintendents is not factual or beneficial to the communities concerned. The Minister and his officials need to get more factual evi<Col N="1086" /> dence of what is needed in our communities and counties.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his work to date. He has put in a tremendous effort to try to deal effectively with organised crime, which has been fairly effectively dealt with. He should now move on to deal with juvenile crime which takes place mainly at the weekends and is mainly drink related as young people now have more money to spend on drink. Communities are up in arms about the level of rowdiness at weekends. There is a need to bring the owners of nightclubs, off licences and late night chippers together to increase the level of community awareness of how people should behave. Some young people seem to have very little respect for authority. They seem to be more aggressive and more interested in picking a fight after a few jars than enjoying themselves. This is a new mood that should be stamped out.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this and the other Bills he introduced since he came into office to try to deal effectively with crime and make Ireland a better place in which to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. While I read about various court cases on pages 3 to 5 of the <i>Irish Independent </i>and <i>The Irish Times</i> every other day, I do not recall such incidents happening. That indicates we have become immune to these incidents, whether the case is one of grievous bodily harm, manslaughter or murder. They mean nothing to us any more. We seem to have a acceptance of a certain level of violence.</P>
      <P>Several speakers referred to late night violence. If my memory serves me correct, Brendan Grace used to do a sketch where a guy was up in court for being over the limit for having had two bags of chips as opposed to one. All the violence seems to happen after visits to chip shops. Deputy Ring also made this point. Many of these premises have restricted trading hours, but we do not seem to implement the law in that regard. If one drives through any village on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, one will see a skirmish of one sort or another taking place. It is a miracle that we do not wake up each morning at the weekend to hear of more than one person being murdered or killed on our streets. Without question late night violence is one of the most serious problems of the modern era. This was reflected in the talk shows on radio over the summer and is reflective of what we see in front of us. It is the luck of God that many more people are not killed.</P>
      <P>When an incident happens we are full of outrage. We saw a young man recently on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; who had his face stamped on, but when offenders come before the courts they tend to get lenient sentences because someone pleads they were under the influence of alcohol, their mother is dying, they have to look after their children, and so on. We accept such excuses but forget about the concerns of the victims of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our medical services are greatly stretched as a <Col N="1087" /> result of such late night violence. If one was to visit any casualty ward of the main hospitals in Dublin tomorrow night, one would find several people who have been injured as a result of drink related incidents or so-called normal violent incidents. We need to address this area. Many genuine people who end up in casualty wards late at night at weekends have to go to the back of the queue while such people are being treated.</P>
    <P>I understand the CCTV system which was installed in Tralee, in the Minister's county if not his constituency, has proved very successful. A similar system has also been installed in Dublin. Representatives in my constituency of Wicklow have been seeking for a number of years to have that system installed in Bray. I believe it has been given the green light but it is not yet operational. There was a serious sexual assault in Bray during the summer and if there was a camera system in the town it would be much easier to identify the culprits. Such a system would not cost much and if it can prevent a brutal and horrific crime such as rape we should consider introducing it around the country.</P>
    <P>I have contacted the Minister's office on several occasions about joyriding in Wicklow, particularly in Blessington and Kilbride. With the best will in the world, local gardaí find it difficult to address this issue and the local population feel it has been forgotten. It has become almost acceptable that every weekend cars are burnt out and the roads become a virtual no-go area for locals. That is probably not unique to this rural area, it is probably the same for the rural areas near major cities all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned the letters the Minister receives about Garda requirements for various areas and he will be familiar with the Glendalough-Roundwood group which has sent several letters to his office in recent years. I am not necessarily blaming the Minister, but a standard reply comes back to the effect that the Minister is satisfied that there are enough Garda resources on the ground, but Glendalough is one of the busiest tourist centres in the country and there is no permanent Garda presence there. It is very important for both local and foreign tourists to have a Garda presence in the village of Glendalough and I ask the Minister to re-examine that position to see if something can be done. It would be reassuring for the local population which has suffered a lot from crime and would help our tourism industry. If one is in a foreign place it is reassuring to see someone in a uniform.</P>
    <P>There have been several violent incidents in Wicklow recently. I will not go into them in too much detail, but they include the tragic death of a young child in Wicklow, the death of a youngster in Aughrim after sustaining head injuries outside a nightclub and the rape of a young woman who was tied to a tree in the Ashford area. Regarding these crimes, it strikes me that Irish people were shocked by the Jamie Bulger incident in Liverpool, but now when similar if not <Col N="1088" /> identical cases occur here the same impression is not made on us.</P>
    <P>This is one of the terrible downsides to our economic boom &ndash; there seems to be an acceptable level of violence. Our society has become wealthier and the gap between rich and poor has become greater. A smaller percentage of people have a greater percentage of the wealth and many people are being left behind. As a result, they are striking back at society. It is difficult to create an equitable society, but one area where this can be done is in education. I realise the Minister is not responsible for education, but he has an input at Cabinet. The Minister for Education and Science has established an expert review group on dyslexia and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have an input here. Statistics from abroad have shown that dyslexics have a greater chance of being involved in serious crime and of going to prison. We should consider putting resources into special needs education, particularly in the area of dyslexia.</P>
    <P>During the summer there were reports of serious incidents on the train taking supporters from the Tipperary-Clare match. Sporting organisations have a responsibility to the public. This morning's newspapers carried reports of the suspensions imposed on Antrim clubs and some elements in the GAA seem to be looking for leniency. Unfortunately, the GAA hierarchy does not furnish me with a ticket &ndash; I get the standard letter back when I write to Croke Park for All-</P>
    <P>Ireland tickets &ndash; but I go to GAA games regularly and I find the acceptance of a certain level of violence increasingly disturbing. When an incident happens we are shocked, but when it comes up for arbitration some weeks later it is generally swept under the carpet and taken as part and parcel of what we are. That is not good enough. It sends out the wrong message to the community, particularly children. We must nip it in the bud. People in court should get harsh sentences, particularly when physical violence is involved. We should not adopt a lenient approach to sentencing in these matters.</P>
    <P>I understand Dessie O'Hare, who is in Portlaoise Prison, is to seek release. I doubt if he qualifies under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, but I ask the Minister to examine that case carefully. That individual was involved in a lot of criminal activity and committed serious, horrific crimes. Many of us may forget that with the passing of time, but the victims do not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill is before the House. This debate began on 1 June and has not resumed until today. It is right to proceed with and enact the Bill, subject to some technical amendments which I will deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, has had a very important impact on our criminal justice system. It has finally allowed for investigations to be conducted regarding individuals whose wealth is <Col N="1089" /> not reflected by any known work they do and who have accumulated assets as a result of criminal enterprise. A large number of these enterprises involved the trade and distribution of drugs and those targeted by the existing Act brought death and destruction to the lives of countless numbers of young people. They broke up families and spread misery as a result of their enrichment. The Minister's amendments are largely of a technical nature, as he said, and are common sense in that they take into account the manner in which the legislation has been applied since being brought into force.</P>
    <P>However, one aspect of the legislation should be fundamentally examined &ndash; although it was not mentioned by the Minister, ordinary people are talking about it as they watch the events unfolding on a daily basis in the tribunals. There are people who held prominent position in public life and who, by virtue of their public life, sought to enrich themselves. I think all of them have been identified so far with senior members of Fianna Fáil and a former Taoiseach who now find themselves trying to explain how they accumulated funds and, in one case, extraordinarily substantial assets while solely in receipt of a Dáil salary. The former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, is currently trying to explain why he benefited from the munificence of what appears to be practically every major, successful Irish businessman in the system from the late 1960s to the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I share the outrage of many people at what we have witnessed. Unfortunately, people have become almost immune to the daily revelations &ndash; very little could now emerge from the tribunals which would surprise people. I have been a Deputy for almost 20 years and I am extraordinarily angry as I listen to the revelations of the manner in which people abused positions of public confidence. It is not something any Member should be sanguine about. We and the general public are entitled to be outraged and Members who, in the interests of the people of the State, involve themselves in public life are entitled to be disgusted by the manner in which a small group of individuals associated with Fianna Fáil used their positions to enrich themselves.</P>
    <P>In that context, a former Taoiseach, C.J. Haughey, accumulated vast amounts of wealth beyond the reach of the overwhelming majority of people and beyond the reach of the vast majority of Members who have served politics and this State in this House since its foundation. I think people are sickened by the fact that, while perhaps there will be revelations of which we are still unaware in tribunals and reports will be published, they believe that ultimately there will be no really serious consequences for the violation of a public trust.</P>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill is designed to ensure that those who have enriched themselves in the conduct of criminal acts do not remain enriched, that the State is in a position to seize assets and that the State and the people through the State can ultimately benefit from the <Col N="1090" /> unseemly gain acquired as a consequence of criminal acts, such as the sale and purveying of drugs, the robbing of banks, conducting fraudulent enterprise or a vast number of other criminal acts.</P>
    <P>No one has yet had the Proceeds of Crime Act used against them for committing the crimes of failing to deal properly with their tax affairs. No one has had the Act used against them, for example, for a failure to declare to the tax authorities substantial gifts of moneys received by them over decades which allowed them to become among the wealthiest people in this State. People outside this House who look at the type of action taken to implement the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, applaud the fact that those guilty of criminal conduct can have some of the wealth they have acquired as a result of that conduct taken from them, but people are right to ask the following question, and I ask it of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister prepared to amend this Act to allow a situation where a former Taoiseach, who is now known to have acquired a vast amount of wealth solely as a result of his position in public life, can become a target of the Proceeds of Crime Act? He may say to me in response that we do not know if he committed a crime. We know he received gifts of exceptional proportions, sums of money that no other individual would expect to receive for any reason from anybody and from such a broad spectrum of people within Irish society, in return, we are told, for no favours, although we do not know that to be true or untrue. That is one of the matters being investigated by the tribunals and I am not going to impede the work done by them. We know vast sums of money were received by way of gifts as a result of someone being in public life, sums of money that went undeclared for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>What consideration has the Government given to putting in place legislation to target individuals who behave in that way in public life, similar to the Proceeds of Crime Act as it currently applies to those who acquire riches and substantial wealth in other circumstances? Nothing is being said about that by this Government. It is being talked about by people on the streets.</P>
    <P>I regard myself as no different to anyone else who lives in my constituency or in any other part of this State. I am privileged to have been elected to this House in successive elections but I want to reiterate that I am disgusted by what has now been discovered to be the behaviour of senior Members of this House, senior members of past Fianna Fáil Governments, in the daily revelations to which we have been subjected in the months and, in some instances, the years since the establishment of tribunals. I find it sickening and it is behaviour in public life that is completely unacceptable. I find disgusting the bemusement at wondering whether to buy an island somewhere off the Irish coast, from where the money will come to buy it, whether to build a large house on the island and from where the money will <Col N="1091" /> come to build it, although mysteriously and magically the money was there and it all happened.</P>
    <P>What morality was applied to politics in those years? What morality will allow people who behave that way to get off, not be penalised financially as a result of their behaviour and perhaps to conclude a simple settlement with the Revenue for a couple of million pounds or £1 million which does not remotely reflect the current value of the wealth they had acquired as an abuse of their position in public life?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to say something about those issues in his reply. I want to know if the Government has any thoughts on this. Will any steps be taken against individuals who have been improperly enriched in this way or will the only step be taken where the Revenue can establish that there has been a breach of the income tax or capital acquisitions tax legislation? These are very serious issues. They go the heart of the political morality and the conduct we expect of people public life.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister, having spoken of the Act of 1996 and the need for the amendments, took some time to talk generally about his achievements in the area of criminal law and in tackling the crime problem. Then the Minister, as he is never shy to do, engaged in the usual personal back slapping and self-praise with which he has become identified. In the context of welcoming this Bill and the amendments it makes, it is worth noting that this is not a measure with which this Government has dealt with any great priority. This measure was published on 17 November 1999 and it took until 1 June 2000, six months later, before the Second Stage debate started. It has taken until October 2000 for us to complete the Second Stage debate. I do not know why greater priority was not given to legislation that the Minister deemed necessary and, in some instances, which was required as a consequence of minor difficulties which had arisen with the original legislation as it was tested before our courts. This simple Bill should have been passed in a speedier fashion and should have become law many months ago.</P>
    <P>In the self-praise in which the Minister engaged in the context of tackling our crime problem he omitted to refer to something which has now been well and truly highlighted in the 1999 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that is, the gross incompetence shown by him and the Government in dealing with the installation of the new PULSE computer system which was designed to bring the Garda Síochána into the 21st century. This is not the time to go into any great detail on that report but the Minister might explain how it has come to pass that a computer system that was originally contracted to be put in place at a cost of £23 million is projected, in the context of the delivery of phase one, to have cost in the region of £46 million. He might also explain to us why the project was scaled down by reducing the number of functions being <Col N="1092" /> provided, the volume of hardware installed and the number of locations in which the system was installed from 242 to 181. The Minister knows the Comptroller and Auditor General tells us it was scaled down to remain within the Government's approved budget. However, the system did not remain within that approved budget and is now less comprehensive than originally envisaged and does not provide the Garda with all the IT functions originally intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify why the acquisition and installation of the PULSE computer system has been such an appalling shambles. He should also clarify why such a costly system failed to properly come on stream in October 1999. As a consequence, the Garda Síochána report for 1999 dealing with the levels of crime, and the statistical analysis of the levels of crime, by and large confines itself to the nine month period from January to 30 September 1999. That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>If a private business spent money on a new computer system to ensure that better information was available, that statistical analysis could be properly conducted, that the information was available to facilitate the development of policy to target areas of crime which require special attention, it would be extraordinary for that business to operate on the basis that one switches on a new system on 1 October 1999 and it does not matter if it works properly for the following six to nine months. This situation means that the Garda report for the year ended December 1999 is laced with provisos and comments indicating that the statistical analysis is not comprehensive because, for the first time in decades, the report cannot deal with the various crimes committed throughout the State in the period 1 October to 31 December. That is a shambles for which the Minister is politically responsible. It is about putting in place the systems to ensure the Garda can efficiently tackle crime. I want the Minister to state whether the PULSE system is now fully up and working. Are there any remaining glitches about which we do not know?</P>
    <P>The Minister pats himself on the back for the fact that overall crime figures are down. However, it is a reality in all societies that the level of crime falls when an economy starts to do well and goes up when an economy gets into difficulties. One area in which the level of crime has substantially increased is in street violence. There has been a significant upsurge in street violence in recent months and a number of young people have died on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere. There has been a failure of policy and an absence of gardaí on the street involved in community policing, visibly present during the day and night to act as a deterrent to violence. The Minister was practically invisible during the summer while young people were being beaten up on the streets of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway. He has utterly failed to tackle the problem of street violence and to put in place the policies needed to <Col N="1093" /> make our streets safe so that young men and women can walk in our cities, day and night, without the risk of being attacked. Other Ministers have failed to ensure that other services, such as taxis, are efficiently in place and available to facilitate young people getting home safely at night so they do not have to spend hours walking from the city centre to outlying areas of Dublin because of the impossibility of obtaining proper public transport or taxis. We will be returning to these issues.</P>
    <P>If I was Minister I would be slow to engage in much personal back-slapping until the real problems which remain are properly addressed. I look forward to hearing the Minister outline what he intends to do about former Fianna Fáil Members who have enriched themselves solely by virtue of the fact that they participated in public life at senior Government level, some of whom, and one in particular, have accumulated wealth to a level which the vast majority of ordinary people find utterly disgusting in the context of the circumstances in which it was acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill. This is a short Bill to make more effective the operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced from the Opposition benches and which has been acknowledged internationally as one of the most important and innovative measures ever introduced in any criminal justice system. These are facts not boasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to similar generosity with Private Members' Bills I introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will achieve this in a number of ways. It will allow applications for court orders to be made in the name of the Criminal Assets Bureau instead of, as at present, in the name of individual members of the bureau; it clarifies that the original possessor of criminal proceeds will be deemed in court proceedings to be in possession or control of those proceeds, notwithstanding that the Garda may have already seized them; it will allow for the varying of freezing orders in the application of the bureau in order to make certain disbursements; and it will allow for evidence to be given on affidavit in certain circumstances where currently such evidence must be given orally.</P>
      <P>By and large the 1996 Act has worked well in targeting and freezing the assets of criminals. In my opening speech I outlined how the Criminal Assets Bureau has, in the period from its establishment in 1996 up to the end of 1999, obtained court orders on property to the value of £13 million, demanded over £32 million in the payment of tax and interest and obtained social welfare determinations and savings exceeding £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are impressive results which prove the effectiveness of the 1996 Act. It should come as <Col N="1094" /> no surprise, therefore, that the bureau is very highly regarded nationally and internationally as a model operation. I intend that these successes will not make us complacent and that is why I have brought forward this amending Bill to ensure its continued effectiveness. To that extent the Bill will further improve its operation and enhance the capabilities of the bureau in fulfilling its functions.</P>
    <P>When outlining the terms of the Bill I stated regarding section 7 that information provided by a person under section 9 of 1996 Act may not be used in evidence against that person in any criminal proceedings, apart from proceedings for perjury. I also pointed out that this limitation applied only to criminal proceedings and would not affect the use of the information, for example, regarding tax assessment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked about tax fraud. The same rules apply. If a person is being prosecuted for tax fraud the same rules of criminal evidence apply and information provided as a result of a statutory demand may not be used against that person in criminal proceedings. It is my understanding, however, that the Revenue Commissioners have the power to require persons to provide details of their financial affairs which may then be used to assess their liability for tax. However, that is not a criminal matter unless it results in a prosecution being taken in the courts.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, Deputy Howlin claims that new criminal gangs have emerged to take the place of those targeted post-1996 and seeks to paint a picture of the forces of law and order being frustrated by the growth of criminal gangs which fill the void left by the defeat of earlier gangs. It suits the Deputy to paint such a picture to give the impression that the Government has been ineffective in tackling crime and criminal gangs. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy that the Criminal Justice Act, 1997, provides for a mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of possessing drugs with a street value of more than £10,000. Deputy Howlin and his party, and Fine Gael opposed that measure. I am preparing a Bill which will provide more effective powers for the Garda when investigating crimes and the Bill before the House will further assist the targeting of organised crime.</P>
    <P>The recently published Garda annual report confirms the trend of recent years of an unprecedented fall in reported crime. This Government has succeeded in bringing crime figures down by in excess of 20% since taking office. These are the bald facts. They are the statistics, they are the facts, and there is no hiding from them. It is plain nonsense for any Deputy to claim that the legislation which has been so effective against criminal gangs has somehow become ineffective and that the gangs have managed to position themselves in such a way that they can avoid the effects of that legislation. That is nonsense. Clearly the law needs to be updated periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness, which is precisely the <Col N="1095" /> purpose of the present Bill with regard to the proceeds of crime. I strongly reject the assertion that, on the whole, the legislation put in place since 1996 is no longer effective against criminal gangs. That simply does not add up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked why the Criminal Assets Bureau is not targeting paramilitary groups which are involved in various forms of criminal activity. I remind the Deputy that the 1996 Act does not distinguish between crimes and their proceeds. In the 1996 Act &ldquo;proceeds of crime&rdquo; refers to property obtained or received by or as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence. I further remind him that the Criminal Assets Bureau is a multi-agency organisation made up of members of the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This structure enables it to tackle criminals and gangs engaged in various forms of criminal activity. The Criminal Assets Bureau, therefore, goes after the proceeds of all criminal activity, irrespective of whether those proceeds are obtained by so-called ordinary criminals or paramilitaries. It would be worth bearing in mind also that the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which I introduced in the House, contains provision for the confiscation of property used in the commission of an offence under that Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin also spoke about white collar crime and e-commerce crime. It may have escaped his attention that I published, at the end of June, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill which will do just what he suggests. This legislation, which redefines definitions in respect of offences such as larceny, embezzlement, forgery and so on, represents the single most innovative legislation introduced in this House dealing with crimes of dishonesty which was ever seen. I do not expect anybody on the Opposition to acknowledge that and in those circumstances, I would be foolish not to say it. I anticipate that this Bill will commence Second Stage in the House during the present session. It will dispel the notion, again repeated by some Deputies, that white collar crime, so called, is more acceptable than any other form of crime. I assure all in the House that that is certainly not the case and will not be the case under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased Deputies on all sides recognise the achievements of the 1996 Act and of the Criminal Assets Bureau. We can be rightly proud of these successes and rightly complimentary of the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is very important that we show our support for the fight against crime so that those who think that a life of crime is a profitable one will know that we as legislators are at one in our endeavours to prove them wrong and that the law will see to it that they are caught and that their profits are taken from them. In short, the objectives of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced in Opposition, in tandem with other measures which I have taken since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="1096" /> Law Reform, are meant to send out two very clear messages. The first of these is that if people commit an offence and obtain illicit assets, the assets will be taken from them. The second, which is now being established through the prisons building programme, is that if people commit an offence, not only will the assets be taken from them, but their liberty will be taken from them. It will not be as it was before. If somebody gets time, he or she will serve it. There will be no revolving door. Progressively the revolving door is being closed under this Administration.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense for Members opposite to claim, for example, that the state of the economy is the sole reason for the unprecedented drop in indictable offences in this State. It must be remembered that the population of the State in the intervening period since 1997 has increased by more than 200,000 people, yet crime levels have dropped by in excess of 20%. That is an extraordinary achievement which Deputy Shatter, if he were magnanimous enough, might acknowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputies Coveney and Reynolds raised a number of issues about behaviour in public places, especially by young people. I am concerned about that. The recent Intoxicating Liquor Act will tackle the issue of underage drinking by imposing severe penalties on publicans selling drink to young people. Deputies will be aware of the recently announced Garda initiative to increase Garda presence on the streets at night to counter crime and anti-social behaviour. This concentrates on locations particularly prone to such incidents. The operation, known as Operation Oíche, will, in its initial stages, concentrate on trouble spots in the Dublin area. However, it is certainly possible that this operation will be extended to other trouble spots in urban centres throughout the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something about which the Garda Commissioner and I have had discussions. I have no doubt but that the Garda Síochána, which was attacked so needlessly by Deputy Shatter during the summer, will be in a position to deal with this matter competently. The reason I say that is that since my coming to office, the number of gardaí in the force has risen from 10,800 to 11,500 approximately. We are now on course towards having 12,000 gardaí in the force towards the end of this Government's term of office, which will be the fulfilment of another commitment made during the course of the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked why the identity card is not <Col N="1097" /> compulsory. While that is not strictly within the terms of this legislation, it is important that I should reply to it. The reason the identity card is not compulsory is that there are a considerable number of young people who are over the age of 18 who do not wish to drink. It would be unfair of me or anybody else to impose upon them an obligation to obtain a national identity card to enable them to consume intoxicating liquor when they do not wish to consume it. The second reason it is not compulsory is that one could not legislate as to when precisely it would no longer be compulsory. For example, would a person aged 68 be obliged to have a national identity card? The objective of the identity card is to ensure that people who are selling alcohol will ask for it if they have a doubt. If the card is not produced, the person selling, supplying or distributing alcohol should not serve, because the offence is now one of strict liability and no excuses are accepted. The offence, if committed, requires no proof other than the sale of the alcohol. It has been eminently successful. I believe that the far quieter than usual night of the junior certificate results this year was due in large measure to the legislation now known as the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter spoke about the work of the various tribunals which has nothing to do with the legislation either. These tribunals are currently examining various matters. Everybody is right to be concerned about the allegations which are being made at these tribunals. However, the rule of law has to operate. It is the task of the tribunals to establish the facts surrounding the allegations. They were established by the Houses of the Oireachtas for precisely this purpose. I, for one, am prepared to await their findings before making judgment and I would strongly advise everybody else to do precisely the same.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear Deputy Shatter state that this Bill should have been passed some time ago. It is a testament to the prolific output of legislation by the Government. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am particularly pleased that this important Bill is being debated at this stage.</P>
      <P>People cannot have it both ways. The legislation before the House is important but other Bills which I introduced &ndash; some 34 Acts are now on the Statute Book since I became Minister &ndash; were of considerable importance. There was a review of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, and following upon that review it was decided to bring these measures before the House. I did not hear Deputy Shatter mention the legislation or the need to amend it before I brought the amending Bill before the House &ndash; which will not surprise anybody.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a relatively short one to tighten up and reinforce certain provisions of the 1996 Act to make it more effective. To that extent, it is concerned with amendments to a limited number of sections of the Act which is working well otherwise. However, I am concerned to ensure that the criminal law is effective against criminal activity and keeps pace with the changing character of that activity. I do not wish to exclude consideration of any relevant matter and, therefore, I will consider any sensible amendments to the Bill which Deputies may wish to offer on Committee Stage. I will not be slow to take on board any which I consider will improve the operation of the 1996 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime we will continue the prolific output of legislation which has been maintained since I became Minister and the Government came into office. We will continue our prison building programme and will have an additional 1,200 places by the end of this year. There are 700 more planned which will be provided during the lifetime of the Government, thereby fulfilling another commitment we made to the people. We <Col N="1099" /> will continue to increase the number of members in An Garda Síochána to 12,000 during the lifetime of the Government so that more gardaí will be available on the streets. We will continue to try and install the CCTV schemes, which were mentioned by Deputies, at other locations around the country because they have proven to be effective in the fight against crime. I am pleased the £46 million or so which was spent on PULSE has been well spent. PULSE is now up and running and proving effective. We will continue to put the kind of resources I have mentioned into the fight against crime, but what I cannot be asked to take on board are criticisms based not on fact but on fantasy.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the House. It might be helpful if I were to outline briefly the background to the introduction of this Bill. The main provisions of the Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, flow directly from recommendations in the report of the Working Group on Company Law Compliance and Enforcement, which was published in March 1999. Mr. Michael McDowell, Senior Counsel and now Attorney General, chaired the working group and its report is commonly referred to as the McDowell report.</P>
      <P>The mandate of the working group was to advise on how best to improve compliance with the provisions and the enforcement of company law in Ireland. Ireland's reputation as a safe and well-regulated place in which to do business has in recent times been seriously damaged by the emergence of strong indications of widespread abuse of company law. The work of the tribunals of inquiry established by the Oireachtas and the reports prepared on foot of company investigations carried out at my behest did much to uncover and throw light on these abuses. It is fair to say that these revelations have led to widespread public disquiet.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the integrity of the system of company regulation was being undermined needed to be investigated urgently and the working group's efforts were directed at this task. It is well known that the McDowell report confirmed many of the worst fears as to the state of corporate governance in Ireland. In short, it concluded that company law was greatly underenforced and that those who sought to deliberately subvert the system of company regulation had little reason to fear that they might be apprehended and punished. In regard to companies' statutory obligations to file returns with the Companies Registration Office, the low level of compliance suggested a culture of widespread non-compliance and disregard for the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address the serious deficiencies in the enforcement regime for company law, the work<Col N="1101" /> ing group made a number of recommendations, which were accepted by the Government. The central recommendation of the group was the establishment of an independent statutory officer, to be known as the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who would have general responsibility for the enforcement of company law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>To discharge this responsibility effectively, the group recommended that the director have at his disposal sufficient legal, accountancy, investigative and administrative expertise to investigate fully and enforce the provisions of the Companies Acts. The group was strongly of the view that the establishment of the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement with the necessary powers and resources was the best way to ensure the enforcement of company law on a consistent and independent basis.</P>
    <P>The Company Law Enforcement Bill provides a range of powers for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to support the performance of the functions assigned to him under the Bill. These can be categorised into four main areas &ndash; investigation, prosecution, injunction and prevention.</P>
    <P>The director will have the general function of investigating suspected offences under the Companies Acts. Specifically, the director will take over the functions which I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, currently exercise regarding company investigations under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part II allow for the investigation of a company's affairs by the High Court on the application of the Minister, and for the direct investigation by the Minister of company and share ownership and the examination of company books and documents. These powers will, henceforth, be exercised by the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The Director will also have available to him the general investigative powers and experience of An Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The director will have the power to prosecute offences under the Companies Acts by summary proceedings and, where appropriate, to refer cases for prosecution on indictment to the Director of Public Prosecutions. With the allocation to the director of sufficient resources to properly and effectively investigate suspected offences under the Companies Acts, I expect that this power of prosecution will result in a far greater number of offences under the Acts coming before the courts and in many more convictions being secured.</P>
    <P>The director will have the power to apply to the High Court for injunctions restraining companies or their officers from continuing to breach the Companies Acts. This will allow the director to take immediate action to prevent ongoing breaches of company law and, by so doing, to protect the interests of creditors and others whose rights may be affected by such breaches. The director will have the power to apply to the High Court for orders to restrict or disqualify company directors and other officers where the <Col N="1102" /> conduct of the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the companies warrants such action. This will prevent or restrict the ability of unscrupulous persons from continuing to use the vehicle of limited liability companies for reckless or illegal purposes to the detriment of their creditors and others.</P>
    <P>The Registrar of Companies has an important role to play in the ongoing supervision of companies' compliance with their statutory filing obligations under the Companies Acts. In recent years the registrar has made great strides in the enforcement of filing obligations through an enhanced regime of striking from the register those companies which fail to make the necessary returns. However, this work is hampered by the absence of a satisfactory and enforceable system for determining the precise date in each year when a company is required to file its annual return.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a remedy for this problem through the introduction of the concept of an annual return date specific to each company, which will be used to calculate the exact date by which a company must file its annual return. This measure will introduce a far more transparent and enforceable regime for the filing of annual returns.</P>
    <P>In addition to its recommendations in the area of ongoing company law enforcement, the working group recommended the establishment of a statutory company law review group. The purpose of the review group is to advise me, as Minister, on all matters relating to the implementation, amendment and consolidation of company law in Ireland. Such a group will prove very important in ensuring that the Companies Acts are kept under continual review with a view to ensuring that Ireland has a first class system of company law. This will facilitate the operation of companies already established in the State and serve to attract international companies to locate here.</P>
    <P>The Company Law Enforcement Bill provides for the establishment of a company law review group on a statutory basis. In anticipation of the legislation and in order to allow the review group to commence its work as quickly as possible, I established the group on a non-statutory basis in February of this year under the chairmanship of Mr. Tom Courtney, solicitor and company law author, one of the country's most eminent experts in company law. The remaining membership of the group combines company law experts and members of representative bodies to provide the best possible advice on the ongoing refinement of the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>I wish to present a brief overview of the main provisions and to highlight those of particular significance. Part 1 contains standard general provisions necessary to the interpretation, commencement and operation of the Bill. Definitions of certain important terms are provided for in section 3. Part 2 provides for the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforce<Col N="1103" /> ment, his appointment, his terms and conditions of service and the arrangements for reporting by him to both the Minister and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 7 establishes the separate legal identity of the director as a corporation sole with perpetual succession. This will allow for continuity in the operation of the office of director notwithstanding changes in the holder of the office. The section also provides that the director shall be appointed following the holding of a competition by the Civil Service Commission. In this regard, the Civil Service Commission has selected a person for appointment as director designate on the understanding that the person concerned will be appointed as director of corporate enforcement following enactment of the Bill. This will ensure that once the legislation is enacted there will be no delay in getting the office up and running. I am pleased to inform the House that Mr. Paul Appleby of my Department has been selected for appointment. Mr. Appleby has extensive experience of the company law area and has been closely involved with company investigations that I have ordered pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the term of appointment of the director shall be for a period of not more than five years and that appointments shall be renewable at the discretion of the Minister. This will facilitate regular review of the performance in office of a serving director of corporate enforcement. Section 10 provides for the removal from office of the director by the Minister for stated reasons. The general functions of the director are set out in section 12 and include enforcing and encouraging compliance with the Companies Acts and investigating suspected offences under the Acts. The director is also given a general supervisory role in respect of liquidators and receivers. The section expressly provides that the director will be independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the transfer to the director of certain functions of the Minister under the Companies Acts. The functions concerned include those relating to the investigation and prosecution of offences under the Acts. Section 16 sets out the director's reporting requirements. The director will be required to produce an annual report of his activities as well as being required to appear before an appropriate committee of the Oireachtas to account for the overall performance of his functions, subject, of course, to the general independence of his office and the confidentiality obligations attendant thereon.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill relates to the function of the director of corporate enforcement of investigating suspected offences under the Companies Acts. The powers of company investigation that I exercise, as Minister, pursuant to Part II of the Companies Act, 1990, are transferred to the director in this Part. This will allow the director to seek to have the High Court investigate com<Col N="1104" /> panies pursuant to section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, or to inquire directly himself into company ownership under section 14 of that Act. The director will in future exercise the power to examine books and documents of companies under section 19 of the 1990 Act. Members will be aware that this is the provision under which I have directed examinations of books and documents in a number of high profile cases. In addition to transferring the function of company investigations to the director, this Part also amends a number of provisions of Part II of the 1990 Act to enable their more effective application, having regard to the practical experience of operating these provisions in recent years.</P>
    <P>Section 29 gives the director the right to seek a search warrant from the District Court where the director considers that there may be held on any premises information, books or documents relating to offences under the Companies Acts. This will be a key tool of the director in investigating such offences.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for the exercise by the director of any of his powers on behalf of company law enforcement agencies from other jurisdictions. In view of the international nature of modern business, this will allow the director to facilitate the inquiries of such agencies where those inquiries require to be pursued in Ireland. It will give the director a firm basis for seeking reciprocal assistance with his own inquiries from agencies outside the State.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill relates to the power of the court to order the restriction or disqualification of persons from acting as company directors or other officers or being involved in any way in the promotion, formation or management of companies. The powers to restrict and disqualify persons are central to maintaining the integrity of the system of company regulation. Sections 38 and 39 empower the director of corporate enforcement to seek to have persons restricted and disqualified by the High Court. In addition, the restrictions imposed by section 150 of the Companies Act, 1990, and the grounds for disqualification under section 160 of that Act are both extended by these sections.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill contains provisions relating to the winding up of companies and, in particular, those companies that are wound up insolvent. The provisions of this Part are aimed at addressing the so-called phoenix syndrome whereby companies go out of business leaving debts unpaid and their members or directors immediately start up new companies without having to account for their previous failures and debts. They also provide for action against companies and their officers where the resources of the company have been so depleted that there are insufficient assets for the company to be wound up. Such actions greatly undermine confidence in the system of company law.</P>
    <P>The director is given a range of powers in this Part of the Bill to intervene in company liquidations or, where the company is not liquidated <Col N="1105" /> because of the insufficiency of its assets, to ensure that persons responsible through recklessness or otherwise for company failures are brought before the courts to account for their actions. The director may seek to have such persons made liable for the debts of their companies or that they be ordered to return assets wrongly transferred from those companies.</P>
    <P>Sections 50, 54 and 55 give the director powers to perform the function assigned to him under section 12 of exercising a supervisory role over liquidators and receivers. These people play a key role in ensuring that the provisions of the Companies Acts are properly applied in company liquidations and receiverships and the director will be in a position to ensure they meet their statutory obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides for reporting by liquidators to the director of corporate enforcement on the conduct of directors of insolvent companies in relation to the management of those companies. This will be a key source of information to the director and will form the basis for decisions by the director as to whether the High Court should be asked to apply restriction orders to such directors under section 150 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Bill provides for the improvement of the existing system for monitoring and enforcing the statutory filing requirements of companies. Section 57 provides for the introduction of the concept of an annual return date which will be used to calculate the exact date in each year on which a company is due to file its annual return. This will greatly facilitate the enforcement by the Registrar of Companies of the annual return filing requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 62 provides for the imposition of on-the-spot fines by the registrar in respect of failure to file returns within the time allowed. This will form part of a suite of measures available to the registrar, including late filing penalties, on-the-spot fines and prosecutions, in his attempt to improve filing rates.</P>
    <P>Part 7 of the Bill provides for the establishment, terms of reference and membership of the company law review group. It is proposed that the review group will operate on a bi-annual work programme and that a reforming companies amendment Bill will be brought forward every two years based on the relevant report of the review group. In this way the group will serve to facilitate the ongoing review, reform and updating of the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Part 8 of the Bill deals with company accounts and auditors. The House will be aware that since the Bill was published the report of the review group on auditing has been completed and made available for public comment. Final submissions on the report are awaited. I will shortly bring proposals to Government on this matter. It is likely that significant further changes will be made to company law in a separate Bill next year flowing from the recommendations of the audit review group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> I regard the report of the auditing review group as a distinct set of measures, the drafting of which will require careful consideration separate from this Bill. That said, there are a small number of measures dealing with auditing and enforcement which are included in this Part of the Bill. These provisions, which derive from the recommendations contained in the McDowell report, will allow the director of corporate enforcement to ensure that auditors comply with their statutory obligations under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 69 of the Bill introduces revised arrangements to facilitate prosecutorial action by the director of corporate enforcement in respect of offences in the auditing area. Sections 70 and 71 impose on auditors and on the recognised accountancy bodies obligations to report to the director where they believe that certain breaches of the Companies Acts may have occurred.</P>
    <P>Part 9 of the Bill deals with financial transactions between companies and their directors and persons connected with those directors. Provisions governing such transactions are contained in Part III of the Companies Act, 1990, and this Part of the Bill is concerned with amending those provisions. The need for these amendments arises from difficulties in the implementation of the existing provisions that have, in certain cases, restricted bona fide commercial transactions between companies and their directors, including the provision of loans and credit guarantees. These provisions are not related to the work of the director of corporate enforcement.</P>
    <P>Part 10 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to this Bill, the Companies Acts generally and other enactments. Section 89 amends section 371 of the Companies Act, 1963, and provides an important power to the director of corporate enforcement. Under this section, the director will be given the power to seek orders of the High Court restraining companies or their officers from persisting with ongoing breaches of the Companies Acts. This injunctive power will be a key weapon of the director in his efforts to ensure compliance with the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 92 redefines the term &ldquo;officer in default&rdquo; for the purposes of its interpretation in the Companies Acts. The revised definition will make it clear that it is the duty of company directors to ensure that the company complies with the requirements of the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Sections 93 and 94 provide for the amendment of provisions of the Companies Acts relating to the purchase of shares and share options in a company by its directors or other persons connected with the company. The amendments are required to ensure that there is no conflict between the provisions in question and provisions of the Tax Acts permitting company directors and employees to participate in Revenue approved savings-related share option schemes. These provisions are not related to the work of the director of corporate enforcement.</P>
    <P>Section 95 amends section 240 of the Companies Act, 1990, which deals with the penalties that <Col N="1107" /> may be imposed in respect of convictions for offences under the Companies Acts. The amendment has the effect of increasing the maximum fine in respect of a summary conviction under the Acts to £1,500 from the current figure of £1,000. The maximum prison sentence in respect of a conviction on indictment is increased from three to five years. These measures are intended to strengthen the sanction available to the courts in respect of company law offences.</P>
    <P>Section 98 provides a mechanism whereby the director of corporate enforcement may impose on-the-spot fines in lieu of the institution of proceedings in respect of offences under the Companies Acts. The director will use this power in appropriate cases to impose penalties in respect of such offences, short of criminal prosecution, thereby obviating the need to take up court time. Persons accused of offences will, of course, have the option of going to court but in so doing they will risk incurring a conviction.</P>
    <P>Section 99 provides that the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, will not apply to the director of corporate enforcement, other than to a record concerning the general administration of the director's office. This provision is required in view of the sensitive and confidential nature of the information that will be held in the director's office. A similar exemption applies in respect of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, represent the most radical action taken by any Irish Government to reform the enforcement regime in operation in respect of the Companies Acts. The establishment of the office of director of corporate enforcement signals a clear intention on the part of the Government to seriously address corporate crime and malpractice in Ireland. The director will lead a dedicated team of accountants, lawyers, civil servants and gardaí in a concerted effort to bring to book those who flout our company laws and damage our international reputation. Never before have such resources been applied to this task.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this debate and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation, the focus of which is on the enforcement of company law and the establishment of the company law review group, both of which are timely and the principle behind which I warmly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To many the old adage of business and ethics never mixing has been reinforced by the revelations of the various tribunals since the early 1990s. Irish company law has been characterised by a culture of non-compliance with only 30% of companies filing returns on time to the Companies Office in 1997. In the past, the approach of State agencies in relation to the enforcement of <Col N="1108" /> company law has at best been patchy and reactive. This led to a perception on the part of some that compliance with company law was an option rather than a rule.</P>
    <P>A similar attitude was highlighted during the DIRT inquiry where enforcement was seen to be haphazard. An analogy to this ethos is that which pertains in our road traffic legislation. It sets a maximum driving speed but poorly resourced enforcement has led to 50% of drivers breaking the law.</P>
    <P>An effectively regulated business environment is essential if we are to maintain a successful and growing economy. Consumers and businesses want to know that the rules of the game are being complied with and that the State is fairly, effectively and actively enforcing those rules. Reform of company law is long overdue and was first proposed by the former Minister, Justin Keating, in the 1970s. In the intervening years similar proposals re-emerged and were subsequently buried.</P>
    <P>The report which finally gave rise to this change in the legislative framework was published 19 months ago and will, hopefully, encourage a change in the approach to date of turning a blind eye to white collar crime. The Companies Registration Office claims that it has doubled the compliance rate in the past two years from a situation where only one in every three companies complied with companies legislation. However, if we take into consideration that during this period over 40,000 companies were struck off the register for non-compliance and that the number of companies is consequently reduced, can we say that the rate has improved significantly?</P>
    <P>Taking this figure at face value, it still demonstrates that four out of ten companies are non-compliant after a two year campaign by the Companies Registration Office. Is the threat of being struck off sufficient penalty to ensure compliance? The evidence shows that it is not having the required impact. On the contrary, unscrupulous directors have availed of the strike off provisions to evade paying creditors and are essentially encouraging the registrar to strike off their companies for failing to make the required annual returns. This allows directors of insolvent companies to renege on their obligations under the law.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the change in the policy of the registrar's office to focus on company directors by taking cases against them must prove to be a more successful avenue. I hope this new approach, the establishment of the director of corporate enforcement and the powers in Part 5 of the Bill will see a significant reduction in the phenomenon of phoenix companies where individuals close down one operation, leaving significant creditors, only to open a similar business down the road within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the Companies Registration Office prosecuted no directors claiming a lack of resources, despite the introduction of a new computer system and a staff of 120. Will the situation differ at the office of the director of corporate <Col N="1109" /> enforcement with approximately 30 staff, excluding gardaí? The directorate will be provided with wide-ranging powers of investigation and enforcement under the Bill. However, it would be a fallacy to call them wide-ranging unless the resources and staff to police the legislation are provided.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has been derelict in her duty to resource the current watchdog over company practices, namely, the Competition Authority, which has damaged its credibility. She has made great play about the future availability of lawyers, accountants and special groups of gardaí to assist the new agency in its work. However, because of her failure to meet the operational needs of the Competition Authority, resignations have been the order of the day over the past year. Demands last year for specially assigned gardaí are still being met with stony silence. The Competition Authority has been surviving on temporary arrangements for legal advice and there are still a number of vacancies for other specialist staff. Why is the Tánaiste starving the authority of these resources? What will be so different about the resourcing of the Director of Corporate Enforcement? </P>
    <P>It is essential that the directorate be provided with adequate resources, particularly in the area of staff with accounting and legal skills. The directorate cannot be expected to operate on a shoestring if it is to be effective. Is £3 million and approximately 30 staff adequate to meet the demands which will be placed on the directorate? Two inquiries established by the Tánaiste have swallowed up approximately £3 million in a two year period, namely, the Ansbacher inquiry, which is estimated to cost £1.4 million, and the NIB investigation, which to date has cost approximately £1.5 million. Similar investigations in future would leave the directorate with no flexibility to pursue other cases. If the Companies Registration Office, with £4.3 million, claims its funding is inadequate to meet the requirements to enforce the provisions of the Companies Acts, how can the Director of Corporate Enforcement be effective on £3 million? Where will we get the professional staff, such as lawyers and accountants, when the Competition Authority is having difficulty recruiting and retaining such staff?</P>
    <P>Compliance with legislative requirements is achieved partly because of the size of the potential penalty but mainly because of the belief that the transgression will be detected and appropriate penalties consistently applied. Going on the track record of other bodies under the control of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, this directorate will have insufficient resources and inadequate expertise to perform the investigations demanded of it. What guarantees can the Minister of State give that this body will have the resources and staff to fulfil its obligation? Without copperfastened guarantees, the directorate's aim to enforce company law will be a futile exercise.</P>
    <P>The principle is welcome but achieving the <Col N="1110" /> goals set for the directorate is seriously questionable. The inclusion of the gardaí as part of the directorate is a welcome element and will provide it with additional teeth. It is also important, however, to have a balanced approach. Comments were made by the Attorney General in which he stated that the era where serious fraudsters can tell investigating gardaí to contact their solicitors is over and going to end with a bang. How do we interpret the term &ldquo;serious fraudsters&rdquo;? This is a fundamental question if we are restricting the right to legal representation as indicated by the Attorney General. Furthermore, the Bill fails to define the term &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;. Can the Minister of State enlighten me as to the Attorney General's interpretation of these powers or what constitutes fraud? What measures are being put in place to ensure the protection of the rights of the individual? The Minister of State must assure the House that additional powers are not open to abuse and are not enforced for any reason other than those outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The directorate will have extensive powers to enforce the law by way of civil injunctions as well as criminal sanctions. The Attorney General claims that this would do for company law what section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, has done for the enforcement of planning laws. It is obvious from such a statement that Mr. McDowell knows little about the planning process. If this is the great white hope for the Director of Corporate Enforcement, then we have failed before we have even started. While the 1976 Act provided the powers to the local authority, unfortunately, it has not assisted in the enforcement of these laws due to the lack of resources available to the local authorities to invoke these powers. Is this to be the future for corporate enforcement? The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, can support that claim because one-third of vacancies in local government planning offices throughout the country remain unfilled. How can this provision be enforced when the staff are not available?</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill will remove power from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to initiate investigations into the breaches of the companies Acts and will transfer these powers to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The Bill also provides for the transfer of current investigations to the remit of the new directorate. It is of the utmost importance that through this transfer the Dáil does not lose its powers to seek updates on the progress of any such investigations. I hope such powers will not be removed from the Members of this House or from Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Currently five departmental investigations are taking place and taxpayers are unaware of the progress or possible completion date of these inquiries. The Tánaiste stated in the Dáil on 13 June that she expected all these reports to be completed by her authorised officers within the next few weeks. Yet we still await an announcement on these investigations. While many of <Col N="1111" /> these investigations were established in a fanfare of publicity, the Tánaiste is slow to comment on the reason for the delay in completing the reports. The Tánaiste stated also on 13 June that she intended to make a decision on the Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited report within the next couple of days, following discussions with her legal advisers. Yet, four months after the completion of the report, we still remain unaware of the actions, if any, the Tánaiste is taking. The Tánaiste stated at the Committee of Public Accounts ten weeks ago that she would shortly be making an announcement relating to one of the inquiries she initiated into malpractice in the corporate area. What does &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; mean because we are still unaware of any decisions or announcements she has made? While the Tánaiste was very vocal initially, ensuring all the facts surrounding these investigations would come into the public domain, she is now not even willing to brief the public as to the progress, if any, which is taking place. I am, however, led to understand that the Tánaiste has indicated to some people that she has the winning of the next election on her desk. Is she putting the survival of the Progressive Democrats before that of the public interest? The Tánaiste must not forget that she received her seal of office from the President, on behalf of the Irish people, and not from the Progressive Democrats. I, therefore, warmly welcome the fact that, through the director of corporate enforcement, these investigations and any future investigations are taken out of the political arena and are not used as a political tool to keep in the war chest until required. While these investigations must be thorough, they must also be seen to be transparent.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for the establishment of the Company Law Review Group, which I believe will have a positive impact on compliance if given the correct terms of reference. It is vitally important that such a group focuses on the consolidation of current Companies Acts to streamline and simplify company law which in itself will promote compliance. The group should also provide on an ongoing basis proposals for amending legislation to reform company law in line with best practice and continue developments both within the EU and further afield. The current situation where there are 278 possible offences under the Companies Acts needs to be reviewed. In a modern, continually evolving business environment, are all the provisions dealing with these offences still relevant? Such a review would identify redundant requirements which should subsequently be removed without delay as this in itself would enhance both compliance by companies and enforcement by Government. At present small and medium sized companies have a huge burden in ensuring they are compliant with the law. Compliance costs on average are 4% of turnover for small and medium sized companies. However, such costs are less than 1% of turnover for a large company meeting the same <Col N="1112" /> requirements. To put this into perspective a company with eight employees would require 50% of one job to deal with issues related to compliance. Streamlining company law without streamlining paperwork will not promote compliance. When reviewing company law we must take into account compliance procedures, commercial realities and the needs of small business.</P>
    <P>While some State bodies such as Revenue &ndash; a primary role model using 21st century technology to simplify its procedures &ndash; have been proactive in streamlining compliance procedures, the Central Statistics Office is the opposite given the amount of red tape it generates which is choking enterprise. Companies claim the information requested by the CSO is never clear, often ambiguous, time consuming and difficult to collate and there is usually a duplication of requests for similar information from both the CSO and other State bodies.</P>
    <P>The Companies Registration Office should also take a leaf out of the Revenue Commissioners' book and should be proactive in providing clear and concise information on responsibilities under the Companies Acts. It should also develop a software package to facilitate the compilation and return of more widely used forms. Ireland needs to bring company law into the new millennium but it also needs to ensure that the arms of the State are proactive in simplifying procedures.</P>
    <P>This is why the strategic management initiative introduced by the rainbow Government is of fundamental importance. However, the Government has failed to recognise the need for these bodies to become more consumer-focused and to streamline their procedures. Rather than use a sledgehammer to try to crack a nut, procedures must be simplified and greater compliance encouraged. Government must promote business by acting as a business. Any additional burdens imposed on business as a consequence of changes to Government policy or legislation should provide clear evidence of the enhanced benefits to commercial life. Such an ethos can run in tandem with increased enforcement if the political will exists.</P>
    <P>Our legislation must be enterprise proofed to ensure that it simplifies the position for small business and, consequently, the review group has a fundamental role to play in reforming the current legislation and ensuring there is greater compliance in future so that the four out of ten companies which are not compliant currently will be in future and small businesses will not be drained of resources to provide relevant documentation to meet compliance laws.</P>
    <P>I will refer to a number of sections into which I will go into more detail on Committee Stage. Section 16(4) states that the director of corporate enforcement cannot be questioned on individual cases and the progress being made on them. While nobody wants to know the specifics of an investigation, it is of fundamental importance that the public, which is paying for such investigations, <Col N="1113" /> is provided with updates on progress. Those powers are available now. The Minister of the day who carries out the investigations can be called before the House to answer questions on them. However, the new director of corporate enforcement will have powers similar to those of the Director of Public Prosecutions. He or she cannot be questioned on specific investigations.</P>
    <P>It is important that there is a mechanism to elicit such information so that the House can review investigations and ensure progress. It is also important to ensure taxpayers' money is being used properly and that resources are provided. I believe the director of corporate enforcement will not have adequate resources. That has been the case in regard to other bodies under the control of the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for the director to provide assistance to similar bodies internationally. What assistance does the Department receive from other countries? Has the Tánaiste held discussions with her European counterparts regarding co-operation throughout Europe and the possible implementation of a broader directive which could result in greater co-operation in the enforcement of corporate law? As boundaries within the European Union continue to fall and there is free movement throughout the EU, the broader aspects of implementing such legislation should be examined to ensure it is applicable throughout the EU so that the same information can be obtained from other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides that the courts, on proof or probable cause, can arrest any person involved in a company if it believes he or she may leave the country and evade payments that are due. This is a welcome development and will ensure that highwaymen will not run off to the south of France, Spain or the Canaries, which has happened in the past. We have experienced this in my county within the beef and insurance industries and with investment brokers. I hope this power is used extensively where that threat exists. It is crucial for small companies that may have liabilities because they could go to the wall if such highwaymen left the country. Companies and individuals will be protected.</P>
    <P>Section 44 provides that the creditors' nominee for liquidation shall be selected on the basis of the majority in value only of creditors as opposed to the majority in number, which is currently the case. This amendment is necessary because of abuse of the system. The section needs to be reformed but it is also important that the rights of small creditors are protected within it because they have more to lose in terms of liquidation. It is likely that large creditors can draw on greater resources. Smaller creditors may be much more reliant on particular customers and ensuring they get something from the liquidation.</P>
    <P>Section 57 introduces the concept of an annual return date. The reason behind this is that the Registrar of Companies will know when annual returns will be made. At present the return date is within 60 days of the company's annual general <Col N="1114" /> meeting but because the registrar is unaware of the date of a company's annual general meeting he or she cannot count the 60 days to ascertain when the returns should be made. Would it be simpler to ensure that companies should inform the registrar of the date of the annual general meeting? It would be easy to count the 60 days rather than introducing this section. Will the Tánaiste comment on that?</P>
    <P>Section 71 provides that auditors must give notice of major breaches of company law, but it would be useful if we could define what exactly is meant by the term &ldquo;major breaches&rdquo;. Some 278 different regulations can be broken under the Companies Acts and one cannot expect an auditor to be aware of all of them. There must be an element of reality in this matter and I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome as it strengthens the powers of enforcement of company law. It is important to ensure that we get greater compliance but there is a serious question mark over what will happen once the directorate is established because the Bill is weak on funding. The Registrar of Companies has a current budget in excess of £4 million but even with a staff of 120, cases have not been taken in the past because of a lack of resources. The new directorate will have a budget of £3 million with a staff of only 30. The Competition Authority has a staff of 29 but finds that it cannot fill vacancies which account for one third of staff positions at present. The authority cannot function because it is missing five out of seven economist posts and three out of five legal advisers. What will be so different about the directorate of corporate enforcement? We can spend all day talking about the need for enforcement because compliance is not taking place, but unless this body is given sufficient funding, proper resources and teeth, it will not be able to implement this legislation. The Minister should reply to this debate providing concrete proposals on funding for the directorate, as well as for the Registrar of Companies and the Competition Authority, which have been starved of resources to date. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill which is important legislation and long overdue. Going back over the years, reform of company law has not been at the top of the political agenda, perhaps because there is not much political dividend to be gained from it. Company law is regarded by many as a somewhat arcane and complex area which has not kept pace with other practices we have seen in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perhaps understandable that over a decade of tribunals and investigations of scandals the focus has been on some leading politicians and, to some degree, on the practice of politics generally. However, if one examines newspaper reports of any of these tribunals or investigations into scandals currently under way, in almost all cases one finds that companies or their directors or executors are implicated. Yet, this seems to attract a <Col N="1115" /> great deal less comment and analysis than the involvement of a small number of politicians. I understand the fact that politicians are in a somewhat unique position of public trust and that it is a betrayal of such trust to become the subject matter of the kind of inquiries that are now going on in a small number of cases. The complicit conduct of certain directors and executives of certain companies, however, seems to attract a great deal less analysis. Yet, without the collusion of certain senior executives in some companies &ndash; some of them leading companies &ndash; these scandals could not have occurred in first instance.</P>
    <P>The McDowell report of the working group on company law compliance and enforcement, to which the Minister referred, was quite blunt in acknowledging the culture of non-compliance with company law that exists in this country. From memory, I think the Minister said that in many ways the report bore out our worst fears about the extent of non-compliance and the culture that has grown up, including the failure of directors and executives to meet their obligations under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>All the way from Goodman, Greencore and Century to Bovale, Brennan and McGowan, and Dunnes Stores &ndash; not excluding, as Deputy Naughten said, some of the leading financial institutions in the State &ndash; the pattern seems to be that company law could be ignored with impunity. Yet, there appears to have been an ambivalence in certain quarters of authority towards corporate laxity, malfeasance and even fraud. At the DIRT hearings people had the opportunity to view for themselves some of the most powerful figures in corporate Ireland professing non-knowledge of the DIRT evasion and demonstrating how little concerned they were with tax compliance.</P>
    <P>Almost every day at Dublin Castle the public have enjoyed the occasional belly laugh at the arrogant incompetence, if not wilful neglect, of their duties and legal obligations by certain directors and senior executives of companies whose affairs are being inquired into. At the end of the day, however, the laugh is on the tax compliant citizen. One has the impression that some people at the top of Irish business do not appreciate that incorporation or limited liability is a privilege.</P>
    <P>That is pretty clearly set out in page 5 of the McDowell report where, in setting out the framework of the working group's approach to the task given to it by the Minister, it records that:</P>
    <P>Limited liability is designed to encourage and foster honest enterprise by permitting people to promote and invest in ventures and activities, and at the same time to limit the consequences of failure. Of its nature, limited liability acknowledges the inevitability of some commercial failures in an enterprising society. The purpose of company law is neither to prevent nor to insure against &ndash; still less punish &ndash; commercial failure. Our company law confers limited liability on the members of an arti<Col N="1116" /> ficial person to foster continuity and to encourage enterprise in the face of risk.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that incorporation or limited liability is a privilege conferred by the State. The McDowell report says &ldquo;The law demands in return that such a privilege be confined to those who act in good faith and who abide by a minimum discipline of corporate governance and commercial probity.&rdquo;  We have listened for a number of years to a litany of cases and a parade of prominent individuals for whom that has no meaning. They manifestly abused the privilege and appear to believe that they could do so with impunity.</P>
    <P>The question needs to be asked whether some of the individuals recently paraded in the investigatory limelight should be free to set up a web of companies. In Germany, for example, a citizen has to establish that he or she is qualified before he or she gets the benefit of the protection of limited liability. Yet, in Ireland, one can go in and buy a company off the shelf; for the purposes of this discussion, let us call it Harney Homes Limited. One can purchase it exclusively for the purpose of a particular project or development. In this case, the company liquidates as soon as the houses are built.</P>
    <P>When the householders move in and find the estate, as is frequently the case, unfinished or defects in the houses and they go to the Harney Group plc, it will say to them, &ldquo;sorry, that is none of our business, that was done by Harney Homes and it has nothing to do with us&rdquo;. One will find that Harney Homes has gone out of business. I have experience of that phenomenon and, apparently, it is completely legitimate under our company law and its non-enforcement. Such a company may disown responsibility.</P>
    <P>Up to now in Ireland, there has been a general presumption of compliance. If one talks to any of the people in charge of the regulatory authorities, one is told there is an automatic presumption of compliance when a company is incorporated. Every day that presumption was abused and this Bill dilutes that presumption. For that reason above all others, I welcome it. The regulatory regime will now be supervised by a statutory officer known as the director of corporate enforcement who will have responsibility for the enforcement of company law.</P>
    <P>The statutory code in Ireland has been entirely inadequate to combat this culture of non-compliance. The Companies Registration Office used to be no more than a registry for company returns. Serious under-resourcing hampered its effectiveness for years. Essentially, it had no role in policing compliance with company law or concerning itself with what constitutes good corporate citizenship. Other than that, the extent of the statutory code has gone no further than certain powers in the Companies Act that reside with the Minister. These powers have sometimes been shown to be cumbersome and inadequate.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister with responsibility for commerce I put seven Bills, some of them <Col N="1117" /> major legislation, through the Oireachtas. However, more needed to be done. For example, in the short time that I was in office, I could not deal with some of the proposals contained in the first report of the company law review group that I wished to address. Yet, my civil servants at the time advised me that no other Minister with responsibility for commerce had enacted seven Bills.</P>
    <P>It is not an area that pays an electoral dividend. Yet, it is a crucial area. The company law code is a crucial aspect of the structure of the modern state. The rights of incorporation and limited liability are important for the proper functioning of the modern economy. However, these rights are granted &ndash; licensed, as it were &ndash; by the State. The limited liability company is an artificial construct and with the right of incorporation and limited liability go the duties of those who avail of the licence and also of the State. If incorporation and limited liability are to work effectively, companies and their directors and managements must comply with the code. The State must efficiently and readily ensure its proper and transparent working and full compliance with the code.</P>
    <P>Compliance is crucial because the limited liability company is so central to our economic life. The company is not simply its members or shareholders. Customers, creditors, staff, bankers and the wider community can all be considered stakeholders in the enterprise and all have certain rights to information &ndash; even the basic and limited information that is required to be filed at the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten referred to the inadequacy of the traditional service supplied by the Companies Registration Office. When I was Minister and visited the CRO, I was completely taken aback at the manner in which it apparently had been either deliberately or otherwise relegated to a concealed role and how it was inadequately financed and hampered by space considerations. It was operating in impossible circumstances and it was understaffed and under financed No priority was given to the Companies Registration Office being able to do the job with which it was charged.</P>
    <P>The changes I put in place are now beginning to bear fruit. I established a major investment programme in terms of information technology. I significantly increased the staff and we purchased a new premises at Parnell Square that is now the headquarters of the CRO and the Competition Authority. I intended that the Registrar of Friendly Societies would also be located there. I have not visited it since and I have not received an invitation to do so. However, if I did receive one, I would check out that this is the case. I do not know if the Registrar of Friendly Societies has relocated to there but the intention was that it would be &ldquo;Commerce House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, they are tremendous new facilities. They provide staff with the opportunity to work in conditions that are consistent with modern requirements. Above all, the investment in information <Col N="1118" /> technology means that they can provide the service to which the public is entitled and also monitor the accurate and timely filing of returns, etc. For that reason, I welcome the annual date of return notion contained in the Bill. It is a small reform that will produce tangible results.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also set up on a statutory basis a type of permanent company law review group which presumably will stay abreast of company law and make recommendations from time to time. That is a good idea but I caution about the need to take steps to ensure it is modelled more on the Law Reform Commission instead of permitting it to become a lobby for special interest groups. There is a danger with such a group that it takes on board a few hobby horses, which are not ideologically neutral and are in favour of certain vested interests, and that it continues to plough this furrow until the law is changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the House's concern about any act of violence or apparent trend in lawlessness. I am sure we all agree that incidents of unprovoked attacks are both worrying and disturbing. It is wrong to draw conclusions or make assumptions about trends without checking the actual data available to the Garda on the subject. Before I <Col N="1119" /> proceed to outline the actions which have been taken by the Government to address this issue, I want to comment briefly on the actual incidence of offending under this heading.</P>
    <P>From time to time particular forms of offending attract considerable public and media attention. This is perfectly understandable and it is certainly understandable that violence among young people, which every parent is naturally concerned about, should attract more attention than other forms of offending. When it comes to assessing the actual incidence of any particular form of offending, however, the level of media and public attention devoted to it cannot be taken as a reliable measure.</P>
    <P>The statistics which emanate from hospital casualty departments cannot be taken as a definitive measure of incidence. While there is no doubt that the staff attached to casualty departments do an excellent and demanding job at all hours of the day and night in dealing with those who suffer injuries of all kinds, they are not trained crime investigators. It is not easy for them, for example, to know who is the victim and who is the perpetrator and the tendency of perpetrators would be to claim victim status. Nor are they likely to have frank admissions when a group has suffered injury in pursuance of a common criminal purpose that there was a single fracas. It is much more likely that each injured party will claim to be the victim of separate criminal occurrences. In addition, a number of these cases would not be related to what is described as street violence.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted by the Garda Síochána that some assaults are not reported, there is no evidence to suggest, particularly in relation to serious assaults, that the public is less likely to report today than they have in the past. As such, the comparison of Garda reported crime over periods of time constitutes the most consistent indicator of crime trend analysis rather than direct comparison with hospital statistics to which Deputy Shatter refers.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the prevailing trends indicate that there is no appreciable increase in public order offences and street violence. A downward trend is being recorded in some of the flashpoint areas. Of particular note is that gardaí encountered relatively few problems on the night of the recent junior certificate celebrations. The Garda has informed me that proactive policing measures on the night, combined with a high degree of parental involvement in the organisation of celebrations, were among the key factors which underpinned the low level of public order problems. In addition, more than 16,000 age cards have been issued already which, together with changes I have made in our licensing laws, are addressing the problem of underage drinking.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the House will accept the strong link between street violence and the irresponsible and excessive consumption of alcohol by young <Col N="1120" /> people, particularly after closing time at the weekend. The congregation of youths outside fast food outlets in the early hours of the morning also leads to public order problems. Contrary to what Deputy Shatter says, these problems have been addressed by me and the Garda Commissioner with a number of initiatives which are designed to prevent crime and reduce the fear of crime. I will now outline them to the House.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have stated that the extended licensing hours provided for by the Intoxicating Liquor Act may have contributed to public order problems. However, the extension of closing time by one hour has not been shown to have contributed to public order problems. As the House may be aware, a national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has been launched by the Garda Commissioner to tackle street violence and public disorder on the streets of large towns and cities. I understand the operation will focus on the primary areas of public disorder, public intoxication, underage drinking, illicit drug use and underage alcohol sales.</P>
    <P>Locations of recurring incidents are receiving particular Garda attention with the emphasis placed on high visibility patrolling. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are also utilised to the full. Pinch-point locations in the city have been selected for intensive patrolling involving the Garda mounted unit, the Garda dog unit and the Garda air support unit.</P>
    <P>The House will be familiar with the positive impact on public order problems associated with the use of CCTV. As I have informed the House on previous occasions, an advisory committee has been established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for new Garda CCTV systems. The committee has to date received in excess of 40 applications or expressions of interest from cities and towns for CCTV systems as aids to policing. These include Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Dublin South Central, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas and Tallaght. It is too early at this stage to say precisely how much all these projects, if approved, would cost.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that the Cork and Dublin South Central CCTV projects are currently being undertaken. The budget for 2000 is £700,000. Recently, the CCTV system in O'Connell Street and the adjoining areas was increased from 38 to 42 cameras and the CCTV system in Pearse Street, Dublin South Central, is currently being increased from nine to 24 cameras.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has also brought together people to provide expert advice on the particular factors which appear to be at work in the manifest tendency towards serious violence in certain instances among young people. Expert advice of this kind from psychologists, sociologists, etc., must inform the type of police response required.</P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, I have made funding available through the national development <Col N="1121" /> plan to expand the network of Garda youth diversion projects. The projects are designed to divert young people away from crime. They challenge the criminal and anti-social attitudes which some young people may have and they are instrumental in bringing about behavioural changes. There are currently 39 such projects and I hope to launch the second phase of the projects being developed under the national development plan within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>In order to curb the sale of alcohol to underage drinkers, last month I formally launched the age card awareness campaign. Any person aged 18 years or over may apply for an age card at their local Garda station to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. I am pleased to report that 16,100 age cards have been issued to date and that applications are being received at a brisk rate. I am confident that the age card scheme will assist greatly those operating in the licensed trade and those who run clubs and restaurants. In addition to these proactive policing measures, the Garda is consulting widely with publicans, hoteliers, off-licences, nightclub owners and so on with a view to ensuring full compliance with the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, imposes a strict liability on publicans concerning the sale of alcohol to underage persons. Already one publican has been convicted under this provision and the new penalty of temporary closure of the premises, introduced by the Act, has been imposed. While legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme, help to curtail the problem of underage drinking, they cannot be viewed as the total solution. Dealing with underage drinking should not be seen as the province of State agencies alone. Parents, the drinks industry and the media must also play their part in helping to address the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>

      </i>The problem of violence among young people, particularly young males, is a source of concern to me, the Garda authorities and every responsible parent. There is no merit in overstating the incidence of this violence no more than there is any honesty in pretending it is an issue of little importance. It is an issue of considerable importance and one which causes understandable anxiety. While it is not something that can be addressed by law and order measures and police action alone, there is no doubt that such measures can contribute to reducing its incidence. I am determined to tackle the problem and I have the full support of the Garda in this regard. Significant actions have been taken, as I have explained, and if further measures are required I will not hesitate to take them.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the Central Statistics Office has established that approximately one third of the crimes committed nationally are reported to the Garda? Will he also acknowledge there is substantially more street violence reflected in Garda statistics? Will he accept that during the summer months we had an orgy of street violence which resulted in a large number of people being seriously injured and in fatalities? Will he accept that his total failure of policy in this area has resulted in his policy of zero tolerance being perceived by an increasing number of people as zero competence?</P>
      <P>In the context of the celebrations on the night the junior certificate results were announced, will the Minister acknowledge that they were quieter than usual due to the shock people experienced as a result of the tragic deaths of Brian Murphy and David Langan just a few days previously? Will the Minister state exactly on what date Operation Oíche commenced and what increase there has been in Garda patrols since then? Why was this problem not treated with the seriousness it deserved and given greater priority as it became obvious during May, June and July that we had major difficulties on the streets of our cities? </P>

      <P>The criteria utilised in compiling the commissioner's annual report were precisely the same during the year 1999, 1998 and 1997 as they were during the period of the last Administration. In those circumstances, we have to take it that we are comparing like with like. The figures show that there has been an appreciable drop in crime levels since the Government came to office.</P>
      <P>With regard to the serious assault offences to which Deputy Shatter refers, I am informed that the total number of indictable assault offences, for the year 1998 totalled 691, with 571 offences detected. Incidentally, that is a detection rate of 82.6%. That reflects well on the excellent work of the Garda Síochána in respect of which Deputy Shatter was so critical during the summer.</P>

What I am trying to set out here is that the Garda report available to me does not buttress the argument being made by Deputy Shatter on a major increase in the number of serious assaults in our cities and towns. However, I am conscious that there is street violence and that this is particularly occurring among young males. The Commissioner and I had a number of dis<Col N="1123" /> cussions on this matter and decided that a specific policing response was required. It is in that context that some weeks ago Assistant Commissioner McHugh announced that there would be an operation, now known as Operation Oíche, and its specific role is to target trouble spots in the Dublin area in the first instance. The objective of the exercise is to try to root out the problem in so far as that can be achieved in the short term. In the longer term, it is part of a deeper malaise. In that respect the Garda Commissioner has set about having the report of an expert group, including sociologists, psychologists and so on, to see what may be done in the longer term in respect of this problem. Resources, in so far as they can be committed to attacking the problem, have been committed. The Garda Vote has been increased over the past three years by 42%. The number of gardaí in the force has increased. The number of prison spaces has increased, and resources generally available to the Garda have increased appreciably.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that he is either ignorant of or deliberately blind to the substantial increase acknowledged by every other monitoring agency of male on male assault, particularly with regard to young males, during the summer months just passed? Will he accept that victim support, and the statistics from the Dublin hospitals, underline the growing issue of male on male violence occurring in Dublin and that it is his primary responsibility to address that issue? What are the specific areas currently covered by Operation Oíche? What plans does the Minister have to extend that form of policing to other areas in Dublin and elsewhere in the nation? Will he accept that it is wholly unacceptable to respond to this issue by way of advisory committee in relation to CCTV cameras and expert group to look into the longer-term malaise in society? While the Minister is establishing expert groups and advisory committees, young people are being maimed, wounded and killed, and he has a responsibility to put a stop to it. When and where will Operation Oíche be extended? When will we have a detailed list of new sites for CCTV cameras?</P>

      <P>This session. With regard to the whole issue of street violence generally, Deputy Howlin quotes figures given by Dublin hospitals, and I understand that figure was 1,400. Initially there was a response from Opposition politicians to the effect that this represented unprovoked assault. The reality is that of the <Col N="1124" /> people who go into the casualty departments, some may be perpetrators, some may be victims, some may have suffered indictable assaults, some may have suffered summary assaults, some may be victims of domestic violence and some may pretend they are victims when they are perpetrators. I am not criticising the accident and emergency staff &ndash; they do their very best in extremely difficult circumstances &ndash; but it is not and it has not ever been their function, and hopefully it will never be their function, to become involved in crime analysis.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda response to date has been effective. It is true that Operation Oíche will be confined to certain parts of Dublin. The situation is being monitored carefully, however, by the Garda Commissioner and over time he will decide, in accordance with his operational function, where and when the operation should be extended. It is not a function of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day to become involved in operational matters. My job is to formulate and implement policy, and that much I have done.</P>

      <P>In so far as criticisms levelled by Deputy Howlin are concerned, I say without fear or favour that never in the history of the State have more resources been given to An Garda Síochána. We are currently aiming for the highest number of members of An Garda Síochána in the history of the State &ndash; 12,000. By the end of the lifetime of this Government we will have provided an additional 2,000 prison spaces. I have increased the Garda Vote by 42% since 1997.</P>

If he considers that the levels of assault and street violence are not increasing, why are there 40 applications for CCTV systems from around the country? Why are all the major towns and cities calling for similar operations to Operation Oíche to be put into practice outside Dublin? Why are consultant doctors complaining about the increased numbers of young men coming into their accident and emergency departments having been beaten up in a more vicious way than in previous years? Is the Minister so narrow minded that he only looks at Garda figures when considering this issue? Is he ignoring the public on this issue. The public is genuinely concerned about it?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to update the House regarding the investigation of allegations against certain members of the Garda Síochána in County Donegal. Deputies have raised a large number of issues in their questions and I shall try to address them as far as possible.</P>
      <P>It is my desire to give a comprehensive account. However, I am constrained by a number of factors. This is a complex matter and a number of issues have yet to be resolved. Six civil actions have already been initiated arising from this case, the Director of Public Prosecutions is examining the question of criminal proceedings in a number of cases, complaints have been made to the Garda Complaints Board and the commissioner will have to consider the question of possible disciplinary action against certain members of the force. I, and indeed Deputies on both sides of the House, have to be careful that we say nothing in the House or outside it that might prejudice related proceedings or unfairly infringe on the rights of individuals.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, some time ago the commissioner appointed assistant commissioner, Mr. Carty, to examine the handling of the original investigation carried out into the death of Mr. Richard Barron whose body was found on a roadside in Raphoe, County Donegal, in the early hours of 14 October 1996. The assistant commissioner was appointed to conduct this investigation following allegations and concern expressed about the handling of the initial investigation into the death of Mr. Barron. We should not lose sight of the fact that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barron, who died as the result of head injuries, have not yet been resolved and this is a cause of serious concern, most especially for his family and friends. I express my deepest sympathy to them. The gardaí are continuing to pursue their investigation into Mr. Barron's death.</P>
      <P>The investigation by the assistant commissioner turned out to be extremely complex and involved a number of different strands. It may help Deputies to appreciate the depth and complexity of the investigation when I tell them that I understand that more than 1,000 statements were taken in the course of the investigation.</P>
      <P>Three main issues were addressed in the investigation, the investigation into Mr. Barron's death and the role of various gardaí in that investigation, allegations of harassment amounting to criminal behaviour and allegations that certain gardaí were involved in &ldquo;hoax&rdquo; bomb-making equipment finds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The assistant commissioner recently completed his investigation and a file in the matter was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions whose directions are awaited. Deputies will be aware that the question of criminal prosecutions is a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine. He is by law independent in the exercise of his functions. I should add that, in addition to determining what criminal prosecutions should take place, the Director of Public Prosecutions will also have responsibility in the first instance for addressing the question of, to use Deputy Shatter's phrase, &ldquo;the possibility of miscarriages of justice&rdquo;, if that matter arises.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have no role in the prosecution of individuals for criminal offences and it would be totally inappropriate for me, at this stage, to make any comment on past or possible future prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might be implicated in wrongdoing. It is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing by members are investigated thoroughly and, if well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated.  However, I remind the House that individuals have a constitutional right to the protection of their good name. An integral part of our justice system is the presumption of innocence and the right to due process. I will not be party to any attempt to breach those rights by arbitrarily condemning individuals or trying to prejudge the outcome of proceedings. The House has to respect the rights of all individuals.</P>
    <P>The commissioner, who has responsibility for the control and direction of the Garda Síochána, including discipline, is fully addressing the issues that arise in the context of the Donegal investigation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the investigation carried out by the assistant commissioner, Mr. Carty, and the possible criminal prosecutions arising from that, there are two other investigations under way.</P>
    <P>Before the summer recess, I was approached by the two Opposition spokesmen on justice who gave me certain information. I met the commissioner and conveyed the information to him. As a result, assistant commissioner, Mr. Murphy, was instructed to carry out an investigation. I understand that he has interviewed both Deputies. His investigation is proceeding and I understand that it will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>The commissioner has also appointed a chief superintendent to investigate a related matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation.</P>
    <P>I have received a report of the investigation by assistant commissioner, Mr. Carty, from the Garda Commissioner. As I previously mentioned, the investigation into the death of Mr. Barron is continuing under the supervision of an assistant commissioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> As regards the transfer of members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division, I am informed by the Garda authorities that when the commissioner received the report of the assistant commissioner on the allegations in question he decided, in the best interests of the public and the Garda Síochána, to transfer a number of personnel. This is a matter of public record and there is nothing further I can usefully add. The transfers will not in any way affect this investigation into all aspects of the matter or preclude further action which might be necessary.</P>
    <P>The question of the alleged tapping of phones has also been raised by way of complaint by the Law Society and the Bar Council. In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have been in contact with the solicitors in question requesting clarification on a number of matters. I understand that a reply to this correspondence is awaited.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993, which provides for the lawful interception of postal packets and telecommunications, there is a complaints referee who examines complaints of alleged contraventions of the Act. The Bar Council and the Law Society have been advised that it is open to their members, if they consider that there may have been a contravention of the legislation, to apply to the complaints referee for an investigation into the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>To summarise, a considerable number of allegations have been made, all the allegations have been or are being investigated thoroughly by the Garda Síochána, the investigation by assistant commissioner, Mr. Carty, has been completed and we are now awaiting the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as regards criminal proceedings, the two other investigations by assistant commissioner, Mr. Murphy, and a chief superintendent are ongoing, the investigation into the death of Mr. Barron is continuing and the commissioner, in the best interests of the public and the Garda Síochána, has directed the transfer of a number of personnel.</P>
    <P>The allegations are being seriously addressed and much progress has been made. I have endeavoured to update the House regarding the action taken to date in respect of the allegations in question and I will continue to keep the House informed of important developments in the case.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that if there was unauthorised tapping of phones, that would be a matter that would not necessarily be capable of being dealt with by the complaints commissioner and the only persons who would be aware of the unauthorised tapping or surveillance would be the people responsible directly for it? Will he acknowledge that unauthorised surveillance can nowadays be conducted without the central control facilities within a telecom com<Col N="1129" /> pany having to be brought into play and that it is possible that is what occurred in this case? Will the Minister clarify when he received the Carty report? Will he advise the House whether he will make the Carty report available to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights after the DPP has determined there should or should not be prosecutions and upon the conclusion of any prosecutions that are brought?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify what is meant by &ldquo;the need to transfer members of the force from the Donegal area in the interests of the gardaí and the general public&rdquo;. Is the Minister aware of what that obscure phrase means? Will he tell the House why it was in the interests of the Garda to transfer five members of the force, or possibly more, from the Donegal area and why it was in the interests of the general public? Will he clarify if those transfers have been effected?</P>

      <P>I will repeat what I said in answer to the Deputy's original question. The question of the alleged tapping of phones was raised. In this regard, the Garda authorities have been in contact with the solicitors in question requesting clarification on a number of matters and I understand that a reply to this correspondence is awaited. Under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993, which provides for the lawful interception of postal packets and telecommunications, a complaints referee examines complaints of alleged contraventions of the Act.

      <P>With regard to the issue of transfers, the commissioner is responsible for the control and direction of the Garda Síochána, and that is as it should be. He decided, in the best interests of the public and the force, to transfer a number of personnel. That decision was his. We must take it that in those circumstances the move was in the best interests of the public and the force.</P>

      <P>I was informed in advance by the commissioner of his decision to transfer a number of the gardaí. I am satisfied that the commissioner knows what he is doing and that his decision was correct. He has my full backing in his attempts to restore public confidence in policing arrangements in Donegal, which was the objective of the exercise in the first instance. My view on publication of the report at present is that it would be wholly undesirable for me to do what Deputy Shatter requests. Clearly this is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who must <Col N="1130" /> decide, in his independent wisdom, how best he should proceed with regard to any individual or individuals named in that report and in respect of whom there are allegations. It is clearly not for me to interfere with that process. Suffice it to say that this is a matter of considerable interest to all Members and to the public. If there are to be prosecutions, they will be held in public and at an appropriate time, steps in relation to the publication of the report will be considered.</P>
      <P>I cannot go any further than that and Deputy Shatter will know why.</P>

      <P>I cannot be definitive on whether it will conclude in a report, but there will <Col N="1131" /> in all probability be a report. Deputy Howlin was concerned &ndash; and Deputy Higgins to a lesser extent &ndash; that Assistant Commissioner Murphy wanted to know who was the informant. Both Deputies were reluctant to release the name of the person who contacted them, but there was no sinister motive in Assistant Commissioner Murphy, as Deputy Howlin will know, in seeking the name of the informant.</P>

I will ask officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look at the commission's report to see if there are some proposals which we could move forward at this point.</P>

      <P>A District Court vacancy arose on 3 February of this year following the appointment of former District Judge Desmond Hogan to the Circuit Court. In accordance with standard practice, I asked the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to furnish me with nominations of persons suitable for appointment to the vacancy and I received a list of names on 3 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The filling of the vacancy was considered at a Government meeting on 4 April. Following discussion at the meeting, the Government decided that the Attorney General, who is a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, should be asked to discuss certain matters of a <Col N="1134" /> substantive legal nature with the Chief Justice who is chairman of the board. A process of consultation then took place on the legal issues and the question of filling the vacancy was left aside while this was ongoing.</P>
    <P>In September, however, the Government decided that the filling of the February vacancy could proceed and I resubmitted the proposal to the Government. At its meeting on 3 October 2000, the Government nominated a candidate for appointment by the President of Ireland as a judge of the District Court to fill the existing vacancy. This appointment by the President is expected to be made soon and will bring the number of District Court judges up to the statutory maximum of 51.</P>

      <P>It is not possible for me to go into detail in this regard without disclosing the content of the Cabinet discussions which, as the Deputy knows, is something I am not at liberty to do. The discussion related generally to the procedures followed by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and whether legislative changes might be required. In this context, a Bill, the Court and Court Officers Bill, 2000, was, and still is, in the course of preparation in my Department and is an appropriate instrument to make changes in the law in this area if change is considered to be desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue;</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for post nuptial citizenship by the spouses of Irish citizens which are pending is as follows: 211 applications are pending for between six and 12 months, 73 applications are pending for between 12 months and two years and 28 applications are pending in excess of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible without examining each application to determine the number of applicants for naturalisation who satisfy the residence requirements. However, the total number of naturalisation applications which are pending for the per<Col N="1137" /> iod requested by the Deputies are as follows: 442 applications are pending for between six and 12 months, 705 applications are pending for between 12 months and two years and 130 applications are pending in excess of two years.</P>
    <P>The average length of time taken to finalise an application for naturalisation is currently approximately two and a half years. The average length of time taken to finalise an application by way of post nuptial declaration is approximately 13 months. While I appreciate that these timescales are lengthy, they reflect the high volume of applications received, the various procedures involved and the pressure on resources and the immigration and citizenship division of my Department.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that the delay in some cases is due to the failure of the applicants to reply to requests for further information from my Department. As part of the recent package of measures announced by the Government in relation to increased resources for the immigration and asylum areas, significant additional staffing resources are being allocated to the immigration and citizenship division in my Department with a view, <i>inter alia</i>, to reducing the time involved in processing such applications and improving the service provided. These resources will impact considerably on the current delays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the waiting times for processing citizenship applications are completely unacceptable? Where persons are properly resident in this State for the statutory period and in employment or running their own business, they should not have to wait two and a half years to acquire citizenship. Will the Minister explain how the comparative department in the United States can process proportionately substantially more citizenship applications in a far speedier timeframe than his Department? Will he acknowledge that just as his Department descended into chaos and was incapable, within a reasonable period, of making determinations on asylum applications in the far simpler area of applications for citizenship even for people who are married to Irish nationals, his Department is not capable of dealing with those applications within a reasonable timeframe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first to accept that the timescale for dealing with applications for naturalisation is undesirable and that it needs to be addressed. Significant additional resources are being allocated as part of the recent package of measures concerning increased resources for the immigration and asylum areas and to the immigration and citizen division of my Department with a view to reducing the processing time for all applications and improving the service provided. I accept that the service is inadequate. These resources will result in a staff complement of about 140 as opposed to 55 prior to the Government's decision. Some of these staff are already in place so there will, hopefully, be an <Col N="1138" /> immediate improvement. Eleven staff are in place, 20 are being trained and the remainder are being recruited. There will be a significant improvement. This situation has concerned me and I have received complaints from Deputies from all parties and Independent Deputies, and from the public about this matter which I am trying to address.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate when the new procedures were or will be in place? When will the total additional staff complement be in place? When the new staff are operational, and in the context of straightforward applications for citizenship where there are no subsequent complications or queries and it is clear that a person has been married to an Irish national for in excess of three years and there is no hint of difficulty, what target time is the Minister putting in place for completing the applications and the grant of citizenship? What is the ultimate target time for processing applications for citizenship from those who have resided within the State for the qualifying period? In the context of the Minister acknowledging that the average two and a half year time span is not appropriate, what time span does he regard as reasonable?</P>

      <P>That, as they say, is a very good question. It is difficult for me to be definitive on what the precise timescale will be other than to say that we are recruiting the necessary staff and additional resources are being allocated to this area. There is a difficulty in that the number of applications for naturalisation received so far this year is 760 which exceeds the number received for the whole of 1999, which was 745. The number of post-nuptial citizenship applications received to date this year is 366 which is 80% of the total received for the whole of last year at 415.</P>

However, I agree with him that the present situation is unsatisfactory and there will be improvements in the short-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 28 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The policy contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated as Minister, is based in part on the recommendations contained in the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Liquor Licensing Laws and takes into account the recommendations of the Competition Authority as well as submissions made by various persons and interest groups in the course of the extensive process in which I engaged.</P>
      <P>The policy in the new legislation received widespread support in both Houses. The legislation has been in operation since 6 July 2000 and all indications to date are that, in general, it is operating satisfactorily. I appreciate that the changes provided are wide ranging and that it is too soon to draw conclusions about their full effectiveness. However, the operation of the law in this area will be kept under review by the Department.</P>
      <P>As indicated during the passage of the legislation, I am, with Government approval, establishing a commission on liquor licensing. The commission will be expected to present a final report within two years. Among the tasks of the commission will be to review the liquor licensing system in light of all relevant factors while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society, including the scope of additional licences.</P>
      <P>While the commission will have a specific remit to examine the licensing system in particular, it will also have a broad remit to inquire into other aspects of the licensing code as appropriate. Plans are in place for a further review of our intoxicating liquor laws. I have no proposals for further changes in the law in advance of the work of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of groups, including Victim Support, have expressed the opinion that the later closing times are placing increased pressure on services such as public order and that, for example, young people are coming on to the streets later when there is less public transport. <Col N="1140" /> Have these concerns been brought to the Minister's attention and what would be his response to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of people who go for a drink do so for social reasons and have a responsible attitude to alcohol consumption. It would not be appropriate in the final analysis to take measures which would penalise the responsible drinker. The new trading hours reflect the changing pattern of drinking habits and are designed to facilitate the responsible drinker. They are not designed to increase the opportunities for the abuse of alcohol or breaches of the law in that regard.</P>
      <P>I have no reports available to me, and there is no evidence to which I can point, which suggest that the later licensing hours have had an adverse effect in terms of an increase in street violence. Before the Deputy arrived I outlined the situation concerning street violence in so far as I could.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that the Garda has been implementing Operation Oíche to target specific trouble spots. My own view is that the later hours introduced under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, are not the cause of the problem. This problem existed before the new hours came into vogue. We have not seen an appreciable increase in indictable offences in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister represents a constituency with large tracts of rural areas. Is he aware that one of the unforeseen consequences of the new licensing laws is the greater mobility of pub licences and the consequences of that for many rural areas where pubs are closing and the licences transferred to larger urban areas? In the context of the commission on liquor licensing which is about to be established, will the Minister ask the commission to consider some kind of step-down licence for rural areas? Many rural pubs open at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and are not comparable with premises in larger urban areas. Two pubs have closed in my constituency which are a social loss to the local community. The Minister should be aware of this fact coming from a constituency such as Kerry South. There may be a case for this proposal as there was in larger urban areas for early houses which opened at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.</P>

It will also make <Col N="1141" /> recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meet the needs of consumers in a competitive market environment. It should take into account the social circumstances as they exist, for example, in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I am not excluding anything from the commission and have left it as open ended as I possibly can in the circumstances. I am open to any proposals which come forward. A different Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be dealing with this in two years when the report comes to hand. When it comes to hand, I feel sure that whoever is of one spirit with me will have the same magnanimous approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 50, 68 and 135 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is at present completing a thorough review of the operation of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986, on the basis of recommendations for change made by the Garda Síochána Complaints Board in its reports and on <Col N="1142" /> the basis of views expressed by the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment; and also taking into account the views of Garda management and the Garda Representative Associations. I have also been listening to the public debate that has taken place on the subject during the course of recent months. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government shortly for amendment of the Act, on foot of this review.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the perceived shortcomings of the present system and the dissatisfaction with its operation, in certain quarters. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the proposals I will bring to Government, I assure the Deputies that the general thrust of my proposals will be to enhance the role of the complaints board in investigating complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. To this end, I have been concerned to get the balance right and not to rush the review which is now close to completion.</P>
    <P>As regards complaints which are outstanding, I am informed by the Garda Complaints Board that the figures up to end August 2000 indicate that there are 1,020 complaints on hand. A total of 335 of these are outstanding for in excess of one year and of that figure, 137 for in excess of two years.</P>
    <P>To some extent these figures are indicative of the inadequate numbers of staff which have, until recently, been at the board's disposal. Some months back I secured approval for a significant increase in the number and grading of staff for the board. Once these staff are recruited and in place I would expect to see an improvement in the time within which the board can deal with complaints. However, there will always be cases which, because of particular circumstances, take an unusually long time to complete, and these would be reflected in the figures which I have given, particularly those relating to cases which have been on hand for more than two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is now substantial public scepticism about the Garda Complaints Board in the context of complaints rarely if ever being held to be justified? Could the Minister indicate to the House what disciplinary action, if any, has ever resulted as a consequence of complaints being held to be justified? Could the Minister indicate, in the context of the proposals for reform which he is bringing before the House, by what date he expects to publish legislation in this regard, and what consideration he has given to the new model being proposed for Northern Ireland whereby a police ombudsman will be put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to give a precise timetable for legislation. However, the recommendations from the Garda Complaints Board, which are before me, are for reform of the present complaints system. The board has expressed confidence in the <Col N="1143" /> present system, subject to the changes it has recommended. I will take account of these and all other observations.</P>
      <P>With regard to policing in Northern Ireland, I do not need to remind Deputy Shatter of what I would describe as the very delicate nature of policing there, which calls for particular confidence-building measures.</P>
      <P>On the wider question of whether there should be a Garda representative or a representative of the Commissioner on the board, and whether that individual should be involved in investigating and so on, that is something on which I have an open mind. There is an argument for having police involvement in terms of investigation for the simple reason that there is no other agency that I can think of which would be more appropriate for carrying out an investigation in the country at present. On the other hand, there is the question of the perception of the independence of the board which is of considerable importance and to which the European committee referred. I have an open mind on it. It is something I would like to have discussed in the House in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's openness in this regard. Does he accept that it is wholly unacceptable that 137 cases have been outstanding for two years? Would he further accept that there is disquiet not only on the Garda Complaints Board but also on the part of Garda Síochána and among the general public in relation to the processing of complaints currently, and that a new approach is required? In that regard, would the Minister be willing to bring proposals in the first instance to the Oireachtas committee? I indicated during the summer that I will publish Labour Party proposals very shortly. Would the Minister accept that this is an issue that should be worked through consensus among the parties in this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes Deputy Howlin himself who was relatively prolific in relation to legislation. I do not recall Deputy Howlin bringing legislation before an environmental or health committee of the House in his role as Minister. Be that as it may, I would be prepared to discuss proposals with the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been considering submissions from var<Col N="1144" /> ious sources, not least the Garda Síochána. We also have recommendations for change from the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture or Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. We have the complaints board's report, and we also have submissions from other interested parties, including the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff associations. All of these proposals are ones I would be willing to discuss with the committee in due course. However, I would first like to formulate it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of delays, most complaints would not take anything like one or two years to investigate. The reason a complaint might take this amount of time is invariably related to the existence of ongoing legal proceedings, which means delays. I do not mean that in any derogatory sense&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but as a fact. I understand that in regard to about 30 of the cases, delays have arisen from the Donegal situation, which we discussed earlier. I also accept that the board has a major caseload and that it requires additional staff. Steps have been taken to address this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What additional staff does the board require? When will the board get that staff? Would the Minister acknowledge that quite a number of the cases which have been awaiting decision for more than a year do not involve legal proceedings and that it is unfair to the complainant where the complaint is genuine that a case should take so long, and to the member or members of the Garda Síochána who are the subject of a complaint, particularly where the complaint is not valid, is spurious or simply mischievous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Delays are of great concern, particularly where the garda concerned is the victim of a frivolous complaint. There are inevitably delays. I have stated that many delays are related to the issuing of legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>With regard to staff, six new staff are being recruited. We received sanction for the following staff in March: three assistant principal officers; two higher executive officers; and 1.5 executive officers. Higher executive officer posts were filled in June and July, 2000. One executive officer post was filled in April, 2000. The job-sharing post remains to be filled. The assistant principal posts have not yet been filled due to the absence of a promotion panel. It is expected that a panel will be available at the end of October or early in November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Minister sought precedent, that the Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999, where heads were brought, might be analogous to the situation where we could build consensus on an issue which is reflective of changing <Col N="1145" /> roles in Northern Ireland and, therefore, not unrelated. Would he accept that to date there is a strong feeling among the general public that there is inadequate transparency in the mechanism of determining complaints to the Garda Complaints Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally satisfied with the operation of the complaints Act and the board, but I accept, as I said earlier, that there are improvements required. The board has made recommendations; therefore, it feels there is room for improvement also.</P>
      <P>On the issue of consensus, I agree with Deputy Howlin that it would be more desireable if we could reach a consensus across the floor of the House on the Garda Complaints Board because in truth this matter is above politics. It is really about the dispensation of justice and people's confidence in the Force, in which I believe they can have plenty of confidence. I accept it is important that the perception of independence be maintained and in that context I will certainly be prepared to discuss the proposals which have been brought forward with the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to see if we can reach agreement on how the board might best proceed.</P>

      <Quest>the steps the Government will take arising from the recent decision of the High Court that prisoners have the right to vote in elections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In a reserved judgment delivered on 21 July 2000 the High Court declared that the failure on the part of the State to provide for the applicant, as a citizen of the State among the prison population, the necessary machinery to enable him to exercise his franchise to vote comprised a failure which unfairly discriminated against him and failed to vindicate the right conferred upon him by Article 40.1 of the Constitution to be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>The prison rules do not prohibit the right of a prisoner to vote. However, the Electoral Act, 1992, provides that &ldquo;Where on the qualifying date, a person is detained in any premises in legal custody, he shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be ordinarily resident in the place where he would have been residing but for his having been so detained in legal custody&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current electoral legislation there is no provision for prisoners to exercise their right to vote at any location other than the designated polling station for the area in which a prisoner was living prior to his-her incarceration. Under the current legal provisions it would be prohibitive for the Prison Service to provide a means by which prisoners could exercise their consti<Col N="1146" /> tutional rights to vote at their home polling station.</P>

      <P>The Prison Service would be obliged to grant temporary release to suitable prisoners and to provide transport and escorts, including armed escorts, to other prisoners who are considered security risks, to a wide range of locations on a single day. Other concerns would be the security of the public, the potential for escape and the secrecy of the ballot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a situation would also seriously deplete the staffing levels within each prison which could have grave implications for the security and good order of that prison.</P>
      <P>The legal position after the judgment and possible responses are under consideration at present in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. My Department is also in ongoing consultations with the Department of Environment and Local Government which has responsibility for electoral legislation.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is now an obligation on him to provide for the right to vote to people who are incarcerated, and that there is an analogous situation regarding students, who are away from home, to register under the Electoral Acts either in their home constituency or in the constituency where they are studying? Has he considered the implications of that on constituencies such as that of the Taoiseach, where between Arbour Hill and Mountjoy Prison there would be 1,200 registered voters who would constitute a significant portion of a quota and might impact on the outcome of the election in that constituency? Has he had any bilateral discussions with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to address this issue, bearing in mind that we might be faced with an election at any moment?</P>

The issue is, for example, whether it will be appealed. That is being considered. If it is not to be appealed, then measures must be taken to implement the court judgment. Then the issue arises, to which Deputy Howlin has adverted, whether it would be a question of people having postal votes or would canvassing be by post or e-mail.

      <P>Most voters are expected to exercise their franchise at a designated polling station and interestingly the Electoral Act, 1992, refers to categories for whom an exception may be made; we all know they are postal voters and special voters. My assessment of the situation is that there is nothing in prison rules, so far as I am aware, which states that prisoners cannot vote, but the High Court has made its decision known and until the Attorney General has discussed this matter with us and until we have come up with a conclusion, it would be premature of me to say what that might or might not be.</P>

Could the Minister clarify whether in the circumstances he regards himself as a volunteer or as a mere prisoner in Government? Could he indicate whether there is any possibility of his party in a tight electoral situation making provision for a postal vote for prisoners and announcing an amnesty for those who do so vote should he be returned to Government?

    <Title>Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>More amendments to the Companies Acts, 1963 and 1990, are provided for in the Bill than is first apparent. The debate on <Col N="1149" /> Second Stage is on the principles of the Bill and we will not go into detail today. There will be a necessity to look more closely on Committee Stage at each of these amendments to the Companies Acts. The Bill is not merely about setting up the office of the director of enforcement, there are a number of changes. Section 71(6) is an example of what I have in mind. Part 8 sets out a good regime for the recognition of auditors, auditor bodies or bodies that qualify auditors and also for the duties and responsibilities of auditors. Section 71(6) intrigues me.</P>
      <P>Some Members will recall the battle here a few years ago prior to the enactment of the Finance Bill, introduced by my colleague and party leader, Deputy Quinn, when he sought to require auditors to blow the whistle on wrongdoing in client companies. The mother and father of a resistance was organised by the same auditors. When I read this section, which is generally a good section, I wondered whether it was reintroducing this matter, now that we are more mature, having regard to the water that has gone under the bridge since then and the conduct of auditors that has been revealed since then. In his response I ask the Minister to deal with section 71(6) which reads: &ldquo;Where the auditors of a company have reasonable grounds to believe that the company is being used or may have been used for a fraudulent purpose, or that a director or directors of the company may have defrauded the company, its creditors or other persons, the auditors shall forthwith notify the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána and the Director&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>I support that but the reason I draw attention to it by way of illustration is because of the focus that will be required on these detailed amendments to the Companies Act. I am curious about the phraseology &ldquo;the company is being used or may have been used for a fraudulent purpose&rdquo;. That would seem to imply a circumstance where the company has been set up for the purpose or is being exclusively used as a vehicle for that purpose or whatever, in other words, that it is some kind of front company used to launder money or whatever. It does not seem to provide for the situation that I thought initially was being provided for that if an auditor discovers in its normal client company there are breaches of the law or actions being carried out for a fraudulent purpose he may blow the whistle. This seems to relate to a particular kind of company. The phraseology used &ldquo;the company is being used or may have been used for a fraudulent purpose&rdquo; is not something I have seen before. This is purely an example. There are more amendments to the Companies Acts than was apparent when I glanced at the Bill, and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> In respect of Part 8 which provides for quite a good regime in respect of auditors, the question arises as to why this is not provided for directors and management. Is there any reason we cannot put in place a system of recognition and a similar regime for recognised bodies, whether IBEC, IOD, IMI or whatever? There is such a regime <Col N="1150" /> on a non-statutory basis in existence for banking with the Central Bank in the role of supervisor and regulator.</P>
    <P>I emphasise a nuance of difference on a point with Deputy Naughten that he welcomes the independent status of the director of enforcement and supports the notion that it should be taken out of the political arena. I question in a philosophical way whether that is always right as it involves the erosion of the position of the Minister and the diminution of accountability. The explanatory memorandum refers to the transfer of the Minister's powers under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990, to the director. It states: &ldquo;It was judged to be more cost-effective, more efficient and less politicised if the decision on whether to initiate a company law investigation or a criminal investigation in any particular case was centralised with the Director.&rdquo; Perhaps it does. I have an open mind on it.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about the gradual erosion of the position of Ministers in different ministries in recent years where a body, an office, an agency, or a quango takes the power out of this House and causes it to reside in a body where it is not clear how accountable it will be in practice &ndash; the National Roads Authority and the ODTR are good examples. I say that in the full knowledge that there are arguments that can be advanced as to why that is the case. It is not entirely clear in tangible terms what the accountability will be in this case. Under the provisions of section 16 the director is required to furnish a report to the Minister which she is required to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas and so on but I do not know if that amounts to much.</P>
    <P>The compellability Act is being amended to put the director on a par with the DPP and to ring-fence him from questioning on certain matters. I can understand why in certain circumstances it might damage the investigation if he were required to answer questions on the specifics. I wonder whether we have to go so far as to amend the compellability Act. I do not think the director is in the same category as the DPP. The DPP is not unamenable to appearing before some committees of the House and his office is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts through the Accounting Officer. I would have thought the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions is significantly and substantially different from the role envisaged here.</P>
    <P>I concur with something that has already been said that we might reasonably have expected the Tánaiste to use the opportunity today to update the House on the various investigations she has under way. She has been coat-trailing these for almost three years. Some, if not all, Members on this side of the House have supported her enthusiastically but she is in danger of undermining her credibility if she does not soon produce results from a number of these inquiries. I am a little surprised she did not take the opportunity today to bring us up to date.</P>
    <P>The regulatory and supervisory role in Ireland, <Col N="1151" /> such as it is, lies with the Minister and, to some extent, the courts. This Bill envisages the transfer of the powers of the Minister to the new office of the director of enforcement, the extension of these powers and the introduction of what might be called a more proactive element as opposed to the essentially passive philosophy of the present regime. Broadly, I am happy to go along with this except for the apparent weakness of the accountability under section 16 of the Bill. I am concerned that there is an implicit idea that politicians cannot be trusted and, as a corollary, that independent officers always can. That is by no means a swipe at the excellent person who has been appointed director. I acknowledge his calibre and conscientious approach to his job and I wish him well in it. He is an excellent choice. The Minister is also fortunate to be advised on this Bill and other matters of company law by the senior civil servant concerned. I know from experience the calibre and intellectual acuity of that official.</P>
    <P>However, I still raise the philosophical question about Ministers being able or required to come to this House and be accountable during major controversies deriving from breaches of company law and matters that develop into significant controversies. Accountability to the House will be diminished as a result of this Bill and we will not have the opportunity to pursue it in the way we would like.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister respond to the question regarding section 28 of the Bill which provides for the repeal of section 19 of the Companies Act and the substitution of a new section 19. Section 19(6) of the 1990 Act remains and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>A statement made by a person in compliance with a requirement imposed by virtue of this section may be used in evidence against him.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record part of a submission by a friend of mine who did not authorise me to give her name. She made the submission in the context of the review group on auditing. She says:</P>
    <P>Since the 1990 Act was implemented there have been a series of court actions in relation to allegations of corporate malpractice in the National Irish Bank. One of the Supreme Court judgments arose from an action taken by the Minister's inspectors and whilst this was in reference to statements given to the inspectors, it was held that there is a constitutional right not to have involuntary evidence accepted at a criminal trial. ... Subsequent to this judgment it seems most inappropriate to retain the wording of subsection (6). Moreover, including this form of words in the Company Law Enforcement Bill will hardly send encouraging signals to employees that disclosure of malpractice is recognised as being laudable in any respect. A more appropriate signal would be to use the form of words adopted in section 29(6) of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine <Col N="1152" /> Casualties) Act, 2000. This Act was passed in the same month as the Bill was published and the relevant section of the Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>If a person objects to answering a question asked of him or her as a witness at an investigation or inquiry on the grounds that the answer might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty, and the person is informed of his or her obligation to answer the question, the person shall not refuse to answer the question but the answer given on that occasion shall not be admissible as evidence in criminal or other proceedings against the person other than proceedings against him or her in respect of the falsity of the answer or the failure to answer the question.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the investigations that are the subject of the Act I quoted are likely to include death and serious injury which are, by definition, of even greater seriousness than corporate malpractice. I am anxious to hear the Minister address that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is significant reforming legislation. I apologise to the Minister that due to another commitment, I cannot remain in the House to hear his reply. I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their interesting and valuable contributions. We welcome the support shown for the purpose and intent of this important Bill. Without wishing to down play the many vital Bills that will be introduced by this Government this session, I believe this is one of the most significant to come before the Oireachtas and that it will have a long-term positive effect on our economic and social well being through this millennium.</P>
      <P>As the Tánaiste explained earlier, the purpose of the Bill is to introduce a new and effective regime for the enforcement of company law in Ireland. The establishment of the director of corporate enforcement will constitute a sea change in our approach to company regulation. For the first time a dedicated and properly resourced statutory officer, the director of corporate enforcement, is being established to enforce and encourage compliance with the Companies Acts. I endorse Deputy Rabbitte's comments on the quality of the person appointed to this position and of the persons advising us on this Bill. Individually and collectively, the staff of the Department do an outstanding job in one of the country's most important areas of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that the existence of the office of director of corporate enforcement, with the necessary resources and statutory powers to perform his functions, will, over time, bring about a real change in the corporate culture from one of general laxity in regard to compliance to one of general and automatic compliance with the law. <Col N="1153" /> Public confidence in the fair and consistent application of our company law is essential to the maintenance of our economic success as well as to the maintenance of the social contract which has served us so well over the past decade and a half.</P>
    <P>The work of the new director and his staff in bringing to account those who flout our company laws and rooting them out of the corporate landscape will foster and promote confidence in our system of corporate governance, making Ireland an attractive place in which to invest and with which to do business. By encouraging a more compliant attitude in the corporate sector, the director will help protect the interests of creditors and members of companies registered to operate here and all those who are dependent on the well being of our commercial enterprises, including employees and their dependants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be available in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the director of corporate enforcement will bring the enforcement of the Companies Acts and the investigation of companies outside the political arena. Deputy Rabbitte said that this might not be a good thing but we must look at this from a detailed, broad and balanced perspective. Ultimately, it is important that people are certain that they are dealing with an independent officer with a well resourced office and quality staff and that there can be no political interference. It will ensure that equity prevails and that closure is always available. No longer will the decision to investigate companies or prosecute offences under the Companies Acts be subject to political judgment and patronage. Decisions in this regard will be, and will be seen to be, above political influence.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised a number of issues and I will try to respond to as many as possible. There will, of course, be an opportunity to discuss the details of the Bill on Committee Stage when we will be happy to explain what the various provisions are intended to achieve. We have sought, with the assistance of our officials, to keep the Bill as simple as possible. We have also provided a comprehensive explanatory memorandum not only to explain what is covered by each provision but also to outline in detail its purpose and intent. I hope this helped Deputies to come to grips with the detail of this important legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to set out a basic structure and <i>modus operandi</i> for the new director, with the basic powers and resources it is envisaged he or she will need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, rather than trying to cover every possible angle, what we, together with our officials, have sought to achieve, is a basic functional and operational structure. It is likely that over time the new director will identify the need for additional powers which can be provided by <Col N="1154" /> way of an appropriate amendment Bill whenever necessary in future. As seems inevitable with all legislation nowadays, there are a few extraneous provisions included which are not related to the purpose and scope of the Bill but are included to tidy up miscellaneous areas of the Companies Acts. These are not a major source of controversy. However, rather than comment on them now, we will explain their purpose in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten queried the level of resources. I assure the House the resources the Tánaiste and I have indicated will be provided. It would be foolhardy of any Government, taking account of the machinations of investigations in recent years, not to provide sufficient resources for a vitally important new office. The Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and the Department are absolutely committed to providing these resources. The budget will not be a problem and, if additional resources are required, I have no doubt they will be provided. The director will have power to retain people on contract should this prove necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten raised the issue of resources within the Competition Authority, the Companies Registration Office and the Government's commitment to resourcing the new office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. I am happy to advise both the Deputy and the House that in respect of the vacancies for five economists and three legal advisers in the Competition Authority, interviews for the recruitment to the vacant positions are now being held and these posts will be filled shortly. My Department will fill three administrative staff vacancies in the authority in the normal way. Staffing problems have placed major constraints on the authority's capacity to investigate new complaints. I am confident this will change as the newly recruited staff take up their positions. To ensure staffing problems are tackled comprehensively, my Department, together with the authority, is currently involved with outside consultants in a study of the authority's operations with a view to having its future resource requirements assessed. All staffing issues are being dealt with in the study. We are fully committed to ensuring that the authority is adequately resourced to discharge its important statutory functions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Companies Registration Office, the additional resourcing of that office over recent years has been continued by this Administration and the results of that investment in resources is clear for all to see. I am proud that we have a Companies Registration Office which is second to none and equal to the best in the world. With the introduction in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, of the power to strike off companies which have not filed a return in respect of one year, the target for 2000 is now set at getting 100% of companies due to file an annual return for 1999 to do so at the latest by the end of 2000. By the end of July last the percentage of companies filing their 1999 annual <Col N="1155" /> returns had increased to an impressive 70%, well on the way to the desired goal of 100% compliance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten referred to the reporting arrangements to which the Director of Corporate Enforcement will be subject under section 12. Notwithstanding the operational independence of the director, section 16 of the Bill provides a mechanism for reporting by the director both to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The director will be required to make an annual report to the Minister of his or her activities within three months of the end of each year. The Minister will present this report to the Oireachtas within a further two months. In addition, the Minister may require the director to furnish, from time to time, such information about the performance of the director's functions as the Minister or Government of the day may require.</P>
    <P>The director will also be subject to scrutiny before committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas as to the performance of his or her functions. This will not extend to providing information relating to particular cases dealt with by the director, which will remain absolutely confidential.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with reporting by the director reflect that while the director is operationally independent, he or she is still accountable both to the Minister and to the Oireachtas for the general administration of the office and for the discharge of his or her functions. Based on his or her reports, the Oireachtas will have sufficient information to advise as to whether the resources and staff to the director are adequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten raised the issue of progress reports in relation to investigations of companies and examinations of the books and documents of companies undertaken under the provisions of Part II of the Companies Acts, 1990. The Minister must have regard to legal advice in terms of the statements she is in a position to make concerning the detail on investigations undertaken using her powers under the Companies Acts. The Deputy and the House will be aware that many of these investigations are the subject of legal proceedings and the Minister is limited in the information she may disclose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position when the powers under the 1990 Act are transferred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, it is important to remember that the director will be independent in the performance of his or her functions and it would be entirely inappropriate for the director to report either to the Oireachtas or in any other forum on the conduct of investigations undertaken by his office.</P>
    <P>The director will be subject to the general supervision of the Minister as regards the administration of his or her office and the performance of his or her functions. The Bill specifically provides for reporting on these issues. The director will be subject to the constraints which currently <Col N="1156" /> constrain the Minister with regard to the publication or disclosure of information obtained using the powers provided for under Part II of the Companies Act, 1999. This will not render the director unaccountable for the manner in which he or she performs his or her functions either to the Oireachtas or the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the abuse of the privilege of limited liability. I have no doubt that, whatever happened in the past, this will no longer be tolerated in the future. The provisions on restriction and disqualification will severely limit the ability of people to abuse limited liability. In future, in every company that goes into insolvent liquidation, the directors of that company will be subject to restriction actions in the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten referred to section 57 which replaces the existing section 127 of the Companies Act, 1963, and which specifies the time limit within which a company must complete and file its annual return with the Registrar of Companies. The replacement section 127 provides for the introduction of an annual return date as a basis for calculating the date by which the annual return is due to be filed. Under the existing law, a company is required to complete its annual return within 60 days of the holding of its annual general meeting and forward it to the Registrar of Companies forthwith. The registrar has no way of knowing precisely when a company holds its AGM, therefore, it is not alerted to the fact that a company has missed its deadline for filing its annual return. This makes timely enforcement of the annual return filing requirement impossible.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the annual return date will address this problem. The annual return date is to be a definite and specific date in each year to which a company's annual return must be made up. The return must be filed with the Registrar of Companies within 28 days of the annual return date. A method of calculating the annual return date for every company is provided at section 57 of the Company Law Enforcement Bill. By establishing a definite date in each year by which a company must file its annual return, the introduction of the annual return date will allow the registrar to effectively monitor each company's compliance with its filing requirements and observe the pattern of filing returns. The registrar will know to the day precisely when a company has defaulted on its filing requirement. This will facilitate the proposed introduction of a progressively increasing late filing penalty that will act as an ongoing incentive to file notwithstanding the elapse of the permitted period for filing. If a company files its return one month late, it will pay a lower penalty than one that files three months late, and so on. Knowledge of the precise date by which a given company is due to file its annual return is essential to the successful operation of a late filing penalty system along these lines. A particular benefit is that it will allow the registrar to issue advance notices of the requirement to file. This will make the system much more fluid and effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> Deputy Naughten raised also the question of detail in relation to section 57 of the Bill. I understand the Deputy suggested the current difficulty with the enforcement of the annual return filing requirement could be addressed by requiring companies to inform the Registrar of Companies of the date on which they hold their annual general meetings. I welcome Deputy Naughten's suggestion on this matter but point out that the proposed system would allow the registrar to be much more pro-active in the matter of annual returns. It will allow him to issue companies with notice of when their returns are due and further reminders when they fail to file on time. The Companies Registration Office will operate a new system involving a range of measures, including an increasing late filing penalty, imposition of on-the-spot fines, prosecutions and, if necessary, strike off as a last resort. Over the years the CRO has always been reluctant to strike off companies. It is a last resort and companies are given every opportunity to file but if they do not do so there is no option. That position has obtained over recent years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten queried the work programme of the non-statutory company law review group. I agree the review group has a vital role to play. The group, established on an interim non-statutory basis, held its first meeting on 7 February 2000. It will be placed on a statutory footing on enactment of the Bill. The group is chaired by Thomas B. Courtney, solicitor, company law author and head of legal affairs with ICS Building Society and one of Ireland's most eminent experts in company law.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the review group will operate to a bi-annual work programme and that a reforming companies amendment Bill will be brought forward every two years based on the relevant report of the review group. In the first two-yearly work programme assigned to the group I have asked it to examine a number of issues. The group has advertised for submissions to assist that process.</P>
    <P>Issues being considered include simplification of company law; review of the law on company directors; consideration of the desirability of a statutory licensing scheme for liquidators, examiners and receivers; review of company law in the light of new technological developments; consideration of the case for dedicated treatment of commercial cases within the courts system; and the duties and regulation of auditors having regard to the report of the review group on auditing.</P>
    <P>The work of the review group is proceeding satisfactorily. Eight sub-committees have been set up as the main <i>modus operandi</i> for the consideration of recommendations and drafting of its first report. The sub-committees meet regularly. On completion of its initial two year work programme, the review group will report to the Tánaiste on its conclusions and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The project to consolidate company law is also <Col N="1158" /> under way. A technical expert has been retained on a part-time basis to assist with this task. A consultative process involving the Bar Council, Law Society and Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, Ireland, is built into the project. In developing the consolidation project regard will be had to the work of the company law review group and <i>vice versa.</i> I have no doubt the group will also examine the need for 300 offences under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the reform of company law. This has been addressed both through increased staffing and through the work of the company law review group. He referred, quite correctly, to the need to have adequate and timely information in the CRO. This is being addressed both by a very proactive role by the registrar and by the new provisions on annual return date. I confirm that the CRO, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Competition Authority are all located in the one building in Parnell Square, Dublin, a modern and sophisticated office block.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Rabbitte and Naughten raised the question of the redress that is available to persons whose rights have been infringed or who have suffered losses through the activities of unscrupulous persons using limited liability companies for illicit purposes. The Government shares the righteous concern of the Deputies in this regard and this is one of the main motivating factors in establishing a dedicated enforcement agency whose work will serve to root out such unscrupulous persons from the corporate landscape. The Director of Corporate Enforcement will have powers to seek injunctions or other orders of the High Court preventing people from continuing to breach or flout the Companies Acts. He may seek to have such persons restricted or disqualified under the Acts, thereby limiting greatly the damage they may do. Deputy Rabbitte also referred to section 28, which repeals section 19(6). This will receive detailed consideration on Committee Stage and we will respond to his query then.</P>
    <P>Members have raised a number of issues which are not directly related to the purpose and scope of the current Bill. These will be examined by my officials in due course to ascertain whether further changes to our system of company law are required. As Members will be aware, we have a standing expert company law review group and it may be that some issues might be appropriate for consideration by that body before a decision is taken as to whether it is appropriate for their inclusion in the corpus of company law.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate. Their contributions were both interesting and reasonably positive in most cases. I look forward to the debate on the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage. Finally, I thank Members for their interest in and attention to this important legislation. I am confident that through our collective wisdom and with the assistance of my officials the Oireachtas will put in place one of <Col N="1159" /> the most important Bills it has considered in regard to economic and financial matters.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Health Insurance Act, 1994. Private health insurance plays an important role in the provision of hospital services to a large proportion of the population. It is the intention of the Minister for Health and Children that the Bill will provide a framework which further supports the development of a vigorous and competitive private health insurance market. It implements improvements and innovations in the general regulatory framework outlined in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published by the Government in September 1999. It aims to provide enhanced scope for competition in the market while at the same time strengthening the basis on which solidarity between generations operates through community rating.</P>
      <P>As the House considers this Bill, I suggest to Members that the essence and challenge of legislation in this area is to strike a successful balance between common good values that have served our significant insured population well and the encouragement of competition that can benefit consumers in terms of choice, price and service. It is the achievement of this balance that is at the heart of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> The voluntary private health insurance system in this country has developed to its current high penetration levels on the basis of specific, and widely accepted, core principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, which provide extensive safeguards for individuals in the operation of health insurance. The health insurance market was opened to competition through the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which was enacted in the interests of the common good. The Act provided significant safeguards for insured persons in the context of the opening of our health insurance market to competition in accordance with our EU obligations for the completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act requires health insurance undertakings to operate in accordance with community rating, open enrolment, and lifetime cover. It also provides for minimum benefit, that undertakings cannot provide less than a specified level of cover, risk equalisation, undertakings to share community risks and the registration of undertakings.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for the registration of insurance undertakings which either made cover available to the general public or on a basis restricted to a particular vocational or occupational group, referred to as restricted membership undertakings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct.</P>
      <P>The Act also provided for the establishment of an independent regulatory body, to be known as the health insurance authority. When the 1994 Act was being processed it was indicated that because regulation in this area represented a completely new departure, the framework would be reviewed in five years. The Programme for Government laid the ground for the preparation of the first ever policy statement on private health insurance which was delivered in the White Paper. The White Paper described how the private health insurance system played a complementary role to the arrangements for the provision of health services to the public generally. In that context, it referred to the advantages resulting from the mix of public private-practice established in our hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, as stated in the White Paper, the Government's primary concern is to ensure equitable access to the public health services. Since taking office the Government has pursued this responsibility through an extensive programme of current and capital expenditure to improve public health services and facilities. The Government has progressively and significantly increased investment in the delivery of public health services and is continuing on this course in <Col N="1161" /> order to address the very real challenges which still exist to providing an optimum health service to the general public.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the Government has made available an extra £1,500 million to health since taking up office. This is a 56% increase in the day-to-day resources going into services. This level of increased investment will be sustained. The Government has also recognised that in moving forward the current health infrastructure is inadequate for the delivery of a truly modern and efficient service. The total of £2 billion made available by the Government under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. The serious approach adopted by this Government to health capital funding is highlighted by the fact that this is the first time a national development plan has included the health services to any significant extent. The NDP will bring positive benefits to all sections of our health services and will enable substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure and equipping of acute hospitals, and in facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, older persons, the mentally ill and children in need of care and protection. The whole thrust of the plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient centred and accessible service.</P>
    <P>Public patients who take up 80% of our public hospital bed capacity will benefit significantly from the investment in the hospital sector. The NDP will, for example, enable considerable progress to be made in implementing the recommendations set out in the report of the waiting list review group, the national cancer strategy, the report of the cardiovascular strategy group, and the programme for the development of renal services which is now being progressed. These strategies will have a significant impact in enhancing public health services.</P>
    <P>With the approach I have described, focusing on immediate practical steps as well as long-term measures, the aim of the Department is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying factors affecting access to certain services and I am convinced that the health and social gain for all persons in the public health system will be very much enhanced.</P>
    <P>A key change provided for in the Bill relates to the definition of a health insurance contract which forms the basis for any insurance arrangements offered by insurers. The principal change from the existing definition is the removal from the scope of the legislation insurance plans which are solely concerned with ancillary health services, such as out-patient, general practitioner and dental services.</P>
    <P>There is provision to support the financial stability of community rating by allowing insurers discretion to apply late entry premium loadings in specified circumstances where cover is being availed of for the first time at an older age, or where there has been a significant break in cover. <Col N="1162" /> This is known as a lifetime community rating. As a corollary to this measure, open enrolment provisions of the 1994 Act, which provide individuals with an entitlement to purchase health insurance, will be extended to persons of, or over, the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes revised arrangements in relation to risk equalisation aimed at facilitating competition while providing a necessary safeguard to community rating against the threat of instability which would arise from the development of risk selection in the market. Under the proposed arrangements the Minister will give the health insurance authority, which is to be established shortly, a significant role in relation to the commencement of risk equalisation. A special measure in the area of risk equalisation, aimed at supporting entry to the market, will give any insurers coming in an option not to participate in risk equalisation arrangements for a specified period immediately following the commencement of health insurance business in this country.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill. A number of sections provide for the making of regulations by the Minister in relation to the detailed arrangements to enforce the provisions concerned. Pursuant to the 1994 Act every such regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution passed by either House.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision which defines the principal Act as being the Health Insurance Act, 1994. Section 2 substitutes the key definition of &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo; contained in section 2(1) of the principal Act. The amended definition provides that the focus of the legislation shall be on health insurance contracts which have, to any extent, the purpose of providing for hospital in-patient or day patient services. To reflect the actual market situation and basic differences required in product financing and structure, the definition provides that the term &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo; does not apply to arrangements which provide cover against the cost of long-term nursing care. Section 3 provides for a number of further definitional changes which are of a technical rather than a policy nature.</P>
    <P>Should it be permitted to develop, self-insurance on the part of employers would have the effect of damaging community rating by removing a predominantly young and healthy population from the general risk pool. Clearly such a development would threaten the solidarity between generations which underpins community rating. In this connection, section 4 inserts a new provision which elaborates the type of arrangements which are deemed to constitute health insurance contracts. It provides that an employer who pays, or undertakes to pay, the fees or charges incurred by employees in respect of hospital in-patient services, will be defined as a provider of health insurance and will be subject to the legislation. Recognising the existence of a limited number of public service employment <Col N="1163" /> related arrangements, an exemption from this provision will apply in the case of specific arrangements entered into by a Minister of the Government. Such established arrangements relate to some Defence Forces personnel where full physical fitness and health relate directly to the nature and terms of the employment. The effect of the exemption will be to enable these arrangements to continue as before, outside the ambit of the health insurance legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 substitutes section 7 of the 1994 Act which provides for the community rating of health insurance premiums. It maintains all the essentials of community rating provided for under the 1994 Act. In addition to maintaining the existing protections for consumers in relation to the setting of premiums on a community rated basis, it prohibits the varying, on the grounds of age, sex or sexual orientation, of amounts payable by insurers in respect of the treatment and care of insured persons. I wish to point out that the section will no longer contain a reference to contracts concerned with the cost of nursing care arising from long-term illness or disability. Such contracts are in the nature of long-term care insurance and not health insurance. Health insurance contracts do provide benefits for convalescent care arising from a hospital in-patient stay but not for long-term care. Essentially, this approach removes a non-operational provision and a potential complication for insurers who may wish to consider developing long-term care insurance products in our market. The section retains the provision requiring insurers to operate significantly reduced premium costs in respect of children. It provides for the scope of discretion by insurers to reduce premiums for dependent persons who are receiving full time education, to be increased from under age 21 to under age 23. It also maintains the discretion of insurers to reduce premium charges for members of group schemes and persons in receipt of a pension who are members of a restricted membership undertaking.</P>
    <P>Section 6 inserts a new section which supports community rating by giving an incentive for individuals to take out health insurance at a young age and by ensuring that those who join late also contribute appropriately to community rating. It does so in the context of strengthening and making more robust our system of community rating. Under the section, insurers will have the power to apply late entry premium loadings to persons of or over the age of 35 years, but only in the circumstances specified and subject to arrangements which the Minister will provide for in regulations. This form of premium regime is known as lifetime community rating.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1), on foot of actuarial advice, clarifies that the measure applies to those aged 35 and over. The actuarial advice received was that people who join the system before their mid-30s already make a significant contribution to the solidarity of the system. Subsection (2) provides <Col N="1164" /> that in specified circumstances, set out in subsection (4), premiums may be greater than the norm. Subsection (3) provides the requirement to pay a greater premium amount is to be subject to regulations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that the circumstances in which a premium loading may be applied include the case where a person was not previously insured by a registered undertaking, had a lapse in cover of greater than 12 months duration or was availing of a higher level of cover. Another circumstance set out in the subsection relates to members of restricted membership undertakings who choose to remain outside the wider community rated pool by choosing not to participate in risk equalisation arrangements.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides a definition for the purposes of the operation of the section. Subsection (6) provides that the amount of the premium loading shall be determined in accordance with the regulations. In framing and implementing these regulations, careful regard will be had to ensuring that the maximum permitted loadings are appropriate and do not represent an unfair burden on late entrants. Subsection (7) provides that the regulations may specify different methods or percentages in determining premium loadings, depending on the circumstances set out in subsection (4). It also provides that credit be given for previous periods of community rated insurance cover held.</P>
    <P>Section 7 arises from section 6 of the Bill. Given the intention to introduce late entry loadings, it provides for the disclosure of information relevant to the operation of such loadings between insurers. The information concerned is to relate to the extent and duration of an individual's insurance cover and is to be sought exclusively for the purpose of operating late entry premium loadings. The provision of information will not extend to claims or medical records. The section provides for the Minister to prescribe the arrangements for such disclosure between insurers.</P>
    <P>Section 8 substitutes section 8 of the 1994 Act which concerns access to health insurance cover on an open enrolment basis. A significant change is provided for in relation to facilitating the provision of cover to persons aged 65 and over who had not previously taken out community rated insurance. Heretofore insurers were not obliged to provide cover for those aged 65 and over who were not already enrolled with another insurer. The section maintains the original provisions relating to the capacity of insurers to impose waiting periods, the operation of which are subject to regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides that the Minister may prescribe the circumstances in which a registered undertaking, other than a restricted membership undertaking, may refuse to effect a health insurance contract. Subsection (2) provides that the Minister may prescribe the circumstances in which a restricted membership undertaking may refuse to effect a health insurance contract and <Col N="1165" /> imposes certain obligations on such undertakings to provide cover.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the Minister to prescribe waiting periods for eligibility for cover under a health insurance contract. Open enrolment regulations were made pursuant to the 1994 Act and these prescribe maximum permitted waiting periods for payment of benefits in circumstances including where a person joins for the first time and where a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Subsection (4) obliges registered undertakings to provide health insurance contracts other than in circumstances to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) maintains the existing statutory arrangements which protect individuals from having to re-serve waiting periods on changing insurers where no significant lapse in cover has occurred. Subsection (6) provides that the protection for individuals against re-serving waiting periods on transferring between insurers shall not apply in the case of members of restricted membership undertakings which have decided not to participate in risk equalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister on behalf of the management, staff, parents and, ultimately, the children of Achonry national school. The current situation for teaching staff is totally unacceptable to all the concerned parties at the school.</P>
      <P>At present 61 children are enrolled in Achonry national school and the breakdown is as follows. There are 16 in junior infants and ten in senior infants with four in first class, four in second class, six in third class, five in fourth class, six in fifth class and ten in sixth class. Two families are anxious to enrol their children, two junior infants, in the school, but they feel, in the current circumstances, that is not possible. This is regrettable.</P>
      <P>The children are divided into two natural groupings with the result that there is a total of 34 children in the junior room. This in itself breaches the maximum class size. Of the group, one child has special needs, five are receiving remedial attention and four have been approved for resource input. In the senior group, from a total of 27 children, eight are receiving remedial input while four others have been approved for resource input. It is worth noting that the time allocated for such intervention falls far short of the recommendations in this area. It is unbelievable that two teachers are expected to cope with the pressure of 63 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's policy is to sanction new appointments based on roll numbers the previous September. However, waiting another school year for such an appointment would prove detri- <Col N="1166" /> mental to the education of these young children in their most formative years. I also draw the Minister's attention to the concept of equal opportunities for all children. I am sure the Minister agrees that these children are being denied one of their most basic rights.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting the lack of safety involved. At present, two members of staff &ndash; or, in some situations, one &ndash; are responsible for 63 children. If there is an emergency, there is no back-up or any provision in that regard. This serious issue demands a positive response from the Minister. A health and safety report is being drawn up by the bodies concerned. The Garda are also hugely concerned about the school because it is situated at a dangerous bend. The teaching staff must also control the playground facilities, but that is impossible. Details of the insurance and health concerns can be forwarded to the Minister on request. I have approximately 50 signed letters from parents who are most anxious.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the infrastructure is in place in the school for the appointment of a third teacher. There is a classroom and furniture. The children are also there, waiting for a positive response from the Minister. On the basis of projected figures, the appointment would be held in the next school year. These figures are also available on request.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the concern expressed by all those involved in Achonry national school. The parents are most anxious and the interested parties would appreciate a positive response from the Minister. This would prevent further action being taken. I met the concerned parents last week and they were seriously considering withdrawing their children from the school until a temporary post is created. I strongly advised them against taking such action and said I would make an appeal to the Minister. I hope he will approve the appointment of a temporary post to alleviate the huge difficulties in Achonry national school. I hope to hear a positive response indicating that this problem can be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 44 pupils, which warrants a staffing for the 2000-2001 school year of a principal and one mainstream class teacher. The school has the services of a shared learning support teacher and was recently allocated a shared resource teaching post for which Achonry is the base school. The <Col N="1167" /> board of management of the school is seeking the appointment of a second mainstream class teacher on the basis that the enrolment of the school for September 2000 is 63 pupils. However, in accordance with the agreed arrangements outlined above, this appointment cannot be sanctioned until the 2001-2002 school year.</P>
    <P>Aside from the staffing schedule already mentioned, there are two situations where a school in which enrolments are rapidly increasing may qualify for the immediate sanction of an additional teaching post, namely, where the enrolment is such that the Department's maximum class size guidelines are being breached or by attaining development school status. The position regarding the maximum class size guidelines is outlined in circular 21/99 which issued to the board of management of all schools last year.  The developing school criteria for the 2000-2001 school year are outlined in circular 11/2000 which issued to all schools in May 2000. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular, the enrolment of Achonry national school on 30 September 2000 would have to increase by at least 25 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 1999. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 69 pupils on 30 September 2000.</P>
    <P>The current enrolment at the school of 63 pupils does not qualify the school for an additional post under the developing school criteria. However, in view of the significant increase in enrolment, an inspector from the Department has recently been asked to visit the school and to submit a report at an early date. The primary payments section of the Department will be in contact with the board of management as soon as this report has been received and examined. I hope this is good news for the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The treatment of those in need of psychiatric care in the State falls far short of the standard which people in deep crisis deserve. The standard of treatment is a disgrace. In his report, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has castigated the level of service being provided for this section of society. For example, the inspector has drawn attention to areas of concern in the quality of service provided. These include the substandard nature of some long-stay accommodation. He has also pointed out many locations in which patients spend their lives where the standard of furnishing and decor is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These long-stay institutions are in a bad state of repair and are symbolic of a different era. All pre-1900 psychiatric institutions should be closed and replaced with modern purpose built hostels <Col N="1168" /> for long-stay patients. Facilities should be created in general hospitals for all acute admissions. Modern specialist secure facilities should be made available for the relatively small number of long-term severely disturbed patients.</P>
    <P>The changes should include the rationalisation of the system whereby young patients, functional psychotic patients and patients with intellectual disabilities share the same wards. This rationalisation should take place immediately because it is not right that people with different types of conditions are kept together, despite their need for different specialised treatments. People with intellectual disabilities are not mentally ill and should not be in a psychiatric hospital. There are still approximately 300 such patients in psychiatric in-patient care, excluding St. Joseph's unit at St. Ita's Hospital. This is a totally unacceptable situation. The inspector takes a serious view of this degradation of appropriate care delivery to both patient groups. The inspector pointed out that the clinical review of long-stay patients on a regular systematic basis is essential. It is important that the rehabilitation of long-stay patients is not neglected.</P>
    <P>As regards elderly people, the physical disabilities of their age rather than any major psychiatric impairment is their main problem. The Government should introduce a policy of de-designation from the psychiatric services and establish high quality services for older people to deal with their physical ailments. This has long been advocated by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for these patients. No progress on this issue was made in 1999. This should not be tolerated and the Minister should act immediately.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that there is concern about documentary matters on patient care issues, such as case note entries and the recording of reasons for seclusion and for extending temporary patient reception orders. The reason patients are not given their own clothes shortly after admission has again been raised in this report. It is not acceptable that there is a poor level of communication with relatives, that there is not any complaints procedure or mechanism in some services and that there is not any public display of patients' rights, as set out in the Mental Health Act, 1945. The Minister must ensure this is corrected immediately.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate has always been committed to moving away from a traditional mental care delivery system which was dominated by the doctor nurse model, while at the same time realising that the nursing profession will continue to provide the bulk of 24 hour treatment and care for the mentally ill. I ask the Minister to respond to the inspector's view that there is much evidence that other skills, such as those of psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists, are necessary components of service delivery. Without them, adequate treatment and management in the broader sense is more difficult. The absence or shortage of such professionals in many mental health services represents a serious reduction in <Col N="1169" /> service quality. What measures will the Minister introduce to ensure that multi-disciplinary teams are available, as advised by the inspectorate? </P>
    <P>The inspectorate points out that it has been known for a long time that persons suffering from psychiatric illness have a higher mortality and poorer life expectations than the general population. It is of concern that there were 37 deaths in in-patient care in 1999, of which 14 were suicide. Surely this level of suicide in our mental institutions is totally unacceptable. The Minister must immediately examine why there is such a high level of suicide while people are in the care of State institutions.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1999 was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 July 2000. In accordance with legislation, a copy was also forwarded to the President of the High Court. In his report for 1999 the inspector notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities from 5,101 at the end of 1998 to 4,768 at the end of 1999. There were more than 24,000 admissions to these facilities in 1999, of which approximately 6,700 were first time admissions. The proportion of patients being admitted to acute psychiatric units in general hospitals continued to increase and in 1999 accounted for 35% of admissions. A further 15% were admitted to private hospitals. The number of involuntary admissions at approximately 2,400 remained constant at 10%.</P>
      <P>The inspectorate continued to fulfil its statutory duty to visit each catchment area mental health service at least once during the year and the private hospitals and Central Mental Hospital twice a year. The report is a summary of the inspector's findings following his inspection in 1999. While the majority of services were given two to three days' notice prior to the inspection, a number of inspections were unannounced.</P>
      <P>A number of welcome developments were reported in many of the health board regions during 1999. Examples in the eastern region included the opening of the new acute psychiatric unit at Tallaght general hospital, a nine bed sub-unit for the psychiatry of later life at St. James's Hospital, a day hospital on the campus of St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, and two new health centres in the Kildare service. In other health board areas a new sector headquarters in Bailieboro, County Cavan, was welcomed, as was the opening of a new community residence in north Cork. At the time of inspection, the north Lee catchment area in Cork was on the threshold of its most important development for years &ndash; the planned opening of the new acute psychiatric unit in the Mercy Hospital. I am pleased to inform the House that this unit opened in April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the inspector acknowledged the progress <Col N="1170" /> that has been made in the provision of acute units in general hospitals, community mental health centres, day hospitals and community residential facilities for persons with mental health disorders, he stated that the rate of progress needs to accelerate. The Minister would be in agreement with the inspector on this point and intends to facilitate further significant development of the services under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed in the report at difficulties in recruiting qualified psychiatric nursing personnel, which were particularly acute in the eastern region. However, over £1 million has been provided for local and national marketing campaigns undertaken by the nursing careers centre and the schools of nursing around the country. The success of these campaigns is evident from the fact that the schools of nursing have since succeeded in filling a record 254 training places in psychiatric nursing in 1999 and this record figure was exceeded this year, rising to 300. Increasing the annual intake of student psychiatric nurses is a key element in the Government's strategy for addressing the current shortage of nurses.</P>
    <P>The House will have noted that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1999 was published four months earlier in the year than the 1998 report. I take this opportunity to congratulate the inspectorate and all those who contributed to the preparation of the report for the timeliness of its publication. The Minister welcomed the publication of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1999 and acknowledged the crucial role that the inspectorate, as an independent body, plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector. The report shows that much still needs to be done in the provision of comprehensive facilities and services. The Minister agrees with the Deputy on the deficiencies he has outlined. It is the Minister's stated intention to facilitate the health boards, as far as possible, in bringing about the improvements and developments identified by the inspector.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I have no doubt the Minister will address the issues as soon as possible throughout the coming years, especially under the national development plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate arises from a large public meeting which Deputy Ryan, myself and other public representatives attended in Balbriggan last Monday organised in the town hall by Balbriggan town commissioners and chaired by the cathaoirleach, Therese Fingleton. Over 500 people attended the <Col N="1171" /> meeting and many spoke passionately about their concerns in relation to a service to be provided by general practitioners in the town as part of a doctors on call north-east arrangement between other general practitioners.</P>
    <P>This town of over 9,000 is set to grow, depending on one's predictions and the various development plans, to between 35,000 and 40,000 and one would expect an improved and increased level of medical service with perhaps a hospital in the pipeline, which is needed. Instead, we have a curtailment of medical services in that previously there was an evening surgery and a sense that Balbriggan had a publicly available, well run and responsive medical practice in the medical centre, even though it was run by private practitioners. There is now a strong feeling that this service is controlled from Drogheda and is not as available to the people in the area.</P>
    <P>Those concerns are made worse by the fact that it is covering two health board areas, unlike other examples such as that in Carlow where one health board area is involved. That highlights additional concerns in relation to ambulance calls, for instance, because different health boards are responsible for different areas, whether it be in Ardee, Clogherhead, Collen, Balbriggan or Drogheda. The Minister has to intervene before this type of private practice arrangement begins to offer an inadequate service for the needs of people, particularly those who are terminally ill, the young, the elderly or people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Concern about this matter was made a lot worse by the fact that a general notice was not issued, other than in the local newspaper, until after the service was introduced. The fact that the price of the treatment is to increase is another cause of concern. People will now be more inclined to go to accident and emergency departments in hospitals and that should be of concern to the Minister, given the drive to encourage people to go to their GPs rather than to hospital. In addition, many people without transport are in a constant state of stress because they are being told that if they need urgent treatment, they should first go to Drogheda before some other arrangement is made. That is increasing the stress, aside from the various medical problems that might need to be addressed. Concern has been expressed also that absenteeism will increase owing to the fact that the surgery in Balbriggan will only be open during office hours.</P>
    <P>In view of all of the concerns expressed at that meeting there is an urgent need for the Minister of State and the Minister to intervene before this type of arrangement becomes infamous in the sense that it appears to be a case of the doctors trying to improve quality of life in their own circumstances. The result is that there is a great lack of confidence in the ability of the medical services to respond to emergencies. The elderly in particularly are often reluctant to call a doctor and this new distance between the doctor and the patient, both perceived and real, is an added disadvantage <Col N="1172" /> to people who are already feeling disadvantaged. The examples given of delays in response need to be addressed and we need to have some quality control on the kind of medical service being provided.</P>
    <P>These arrangements should remain in the one health board area. They should be kept local and accessible and there be compulsory notification of the population which they serve before any changes are brought about. There should also be some type of cap on the price of treatment to ensure that people who do not have medical cards are able to afford these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue. On Monday evening last, over 500 people squeezed into the town hall in Balbriggan to express their fears and objections to the new out of hours family doctor service which came into practice in Balbriggan on 18 September. An invitation went out from the Balbriggan Town Commission, which organised the meeting, to the doctors and officials of the two health boards to attend. None of them turned up and I believe this was a public relations disaster, particularly for the doctors.</P>
      <P>It should be stated, however, that all the people who spoke at the meeting recognised the excellent service provided by their family doctors in Balbriggan over the years. Time and again at the meeting we heard examples of older people who in the past were able to pick up the phone and talk to their family doctor. The fact that this was going to change left older people feeling vulnerable. The elderly, in particular, resisted the notion of having to travel to an out of hours centre in Drogheda. For people without private transport the thought of having to ring someone up during the night for a lift was not an attractive proposition. A number of people said they would prefer to wait until the next morning rather than disturb a neighbour or family member during the night to ask for a lift to the centre in Drogheda.</P>
      <P>Many working parents who do not arrive home until after 6 p.m. raised legitimate concerns about the wellbeing of their children should they get sick, possibly with a childminder. The issue of the response time was also raised by a number of people. One person contacted me and stated that her son had meningitis last February. He lived because he was seen quickly by a doctor and sent to hospital immediately where he received medication in time. She said if that had happened under the new scheme, she would not be confident that her son would be alive today. Meningitis is very prevalent in the north Dublin area and the response time in such cases is a matter of great concern.</P>
      <P>The cost of having to pay £40 for an out of service visit to Drogheda was deemed unacceptable. Many people stated this would direct many patients to accident and emergency departments in Beaumont Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> A total of 46% of the population of Balbriggan are medical card holders and are under the jurisdiction of the Northern Area Health Board which has a statutory responsibility to ensure that the people under its care receive an acceptable health service. I understand that a meeting has been arranged next week with senior officials in the health board to discuss this issue. I will inform the board that any new proposals emanating from the doctors that will reduce the existing service to the people of Balbriggan are unacceptable to me and will be resisted. Any changes must result in an improvement in services, not a reduction.</P>
    <P>Balbriggan has a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 people and it is envisaged it will grow to 40,000 in the next decade. It is long past time that the Department of Health and Children and the health authorities should bring forward a proper health plan for Balbriggan. A proper health service delivered in Balbriggan and incorporating a new hospital for the town to serve the expanding catchment area of north Fingal must be part of the plan. In the meantime the doctors in this new co-op must accept the legitimate concerns of the residents of Balbriggan. I recommend that a meeting should be set up between the health board, doctors and representatives of the people of Balbriggan to resolve the impasse that exists. The result of all this must be that an acceptable health service is provided in Balbriggan for the people &ndash; nothing less is acceptable to me.</P>

      <P>Ar son an Aire, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an bheirt Teachta a d'ardaigh an cheist seo. The provision of appropriate general practitioner and primary care services is a key element of health care services and one that the Government is committed to developing in a proper and structured way. I am aware of the public meeting, as outlined by the two Deputies, that took place in Balbriggan on Monday night concerning the provision of general practitioner services in the context of the new out of hours scheme. I am also aware that a number of people in that town are somewhat unsure of the purpose and the operation of the new general practitioner out of hours scheme. That is regrettable and will be rectified by a further public information campaign in the area. However, I understand that uncertainty has been compounded to some degree by anonymous leaflets circulated in the Balbriggan area containing certain errors of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background to the new service I would like to point out certain facts and realities. In recent years general practitioners have tended to reschedule their surgery hours away from nights and weekends to a more nine to five service. Many GPs are involved in rotas to provide an emergency out of hours service for their patients outside scheduled hours. Notwithstanding that, it has become increasingly evident that existing arrangements to provide services at <Col N="1174" /> nights, weekends, bank holidays etc., vary considerably throughout the country and are particularly variable in rural areas. This trend has been matched by increasing public concern at the lack of such services, by inappropriate recourse to hospital accident and emergency services and by a significant escalation in the costs associated with the provision of out of hours GP services under the GMS scheme. As the Deputies will recall, the existence of this problem and the need to address it have been referred to previously in the House.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, certain projects have been developed in a number of health boards to tackle the problem. For example, in the Dublin area, DUBDOC provides an out of hours GP service from the campus of St. James's Hospital. Last year in the South Eastern Health Board area an out of hours GP service called CAREDOC was launched. That was a co-operative venture directly involving the local GPs in the organisation and management of a structured co-operative service. The success of that scheme led to the commencement on 18 September of a pilot regionwide out of hours GP co-operative project in the North Eastern Health Board region called North-East Doc.</P>
    <P>In terms of membership, more than 130 of the doctors in the North Eastern Health Board area joined the project and the five GPs in the Balbriggan area asked their professional colleagues in the North Eastern Health Board if they could join. That request was acceded to in a spirit of professional co-operation.</P>
    <P>Having outlined the background, I wish to make the following specific points. First, North-East Doc is a voluntary scheme, no GPs were forced to join it and presumably in deciding to join it they had regard to the best needs of their patients.</P>
    <P>Second, critics of these initiatives argue that the patient can no longer access his or her own doctor. The reality is that no individual GP can provide 24 hour, 7 day availability to his or her patients. It is humanly impossible. What the North-East Doc project does is recognise that fact and it ensures that fully qualified GPs are readily accessible for consultations, including domiciliary visits, through one simple phone number rather than a series of answering machines and mobile phones. To ensure physical accessibility, there are a number of centres spread throughout the area covered by the scheme and doctors are driven in specifically identifiable cars where visits to patients are required. Those cars are also equipped with communications facilities that allow for ongoing consultation, if necessary, while the doctor is <i>en route.</i>Third, there is some evidence that medical card holders do not always fare as well as private patients in accessing out of hours services and there is a concern that urban areas are better provided for than rural areas. A regionwide scheme like North-East Doc ensures an equality of services. Moreover, it should assist in attracting <Col N="1175" /> doctors to rural areas generally, especially where the problem of onerous rotas in certain isolated locations could otherwise have proved a major disincentive.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the fact that the project originates from another health board area is not inconsistent with the fact that numerous rota arrangements currently in place throughout the country cut across health board borders.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the scheme is a pilot one, only recently established. It is being monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, prior to Monday's meeting in Balbriggan, the decision was made to set up a peripheral centre in the town. The need to further develop that centre will be examined in light of experience.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of the fees charged by participating doctors, as is the case when visiting their own GP, there is no charge to medical card holders under the North-East Doc scheme for GMS services provided. In the case of private patients, the fee to be charged has always been a matter for the doctor involved. North-East Doc has not changed this. However, it is worth pointing out that all patients calling North-East Doc are triaged by a GP and where it is established that there is no need for a follow-up consultation there is no cost. In addition, where the private patient concerned has seen his or her GP during the day in relation to the particular medical problem the level of the fee to be charged is normally halved.</P>
    <P>The provision of appropriate health care is, of <Col N="1176" /> course, a matter that extends beyond primary care. In that regard a range of health services are provided from the local health centre in Balbriggan. These include public health nursing, dental, community welfare, community psychiatry, child health services and a mobile hospital for the elderly. Also, this year the Northern Area Health Board is undertaking some upgrading work and has included proposals in its draft development plan for the provision of a new purpose-built centre.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals to build a new public hospital in north Dublin. Deputies will be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness it was agreed to conduct a review of bed capacity in both acute and non-acute settings. All hospitals in the eastern region and their catchment areas will be examined in the course of the reviews and the outcomes will facilitate the ERHA in determining future policy for the planning of acute hospital services in the region.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned meningitis and I refer to the scheme launched yesterday by the Minister. I hope all Deputies will encourage people to take up this scheme, particularly those deemed at risk.</P>
    <P>I repeat that North-East Doc is a pilot scheme intended to address a particular need in a structured manner. It is being monitored and will be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which deals with public order offences, represented a radical overhaul of criminal justice legislation in the area of public order. It provides for a range of public order offences which can be committed in public places, such as intoxication, disorderly conduct, threatening or abusive behaviour, riot, affray, etc. It also provides the gardaí with important powers to deal with public order offenders.</P>
      <P>I understand that the provisions of the 1994 Act are used extensively by the gardaí and that it is widely accepted that the legislation has proved invaluable to the gardaí in dealing with public order offences. I am, therefore, satisfied that the 1994 Act is providing an effective legal framework for dealing with behaviours which threaten public order. However, like all legislation, the 1994 Act is kept under review. In this respect, the Deputy may be aware from the press release on the Government's legislation programme, issued by the office of the Government Chief Whip on 27 September 2000, that a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill forms part of that programme. This Bill, the heads of which are currently being prepared within my Department, will provide for miscellaneous criminal law reform matters. I am in consultation with the Garda authorities in relation to provisions to be included in the Bill, and any proposals from the gardaí to include provisions to amend the 1994 Act will be carefully considered in that context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>In May 1998 I appointed, with Government approval, the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, to conduct a review of services and arrangements in place in this jurisdiction to meet the needs of those who had suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years. In his report A Place and a Name, Mr. Wilson made wide-ranging recommendations on measures to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering of those in question.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in detailed discussions with other relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of the recommendations. In some areas work has already commenced on implementation. For example, as the House will be aware, former Chief Justice Liam Hamilton was appointed to conduct inquiries into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974 and the Dundalk bombing of 1975. As the House will also be aware, the Taoiseach announced yesterday that Mr. Justice Barron has agreed to take over from Mr. Hamilton, who was obliged to retire from the inquiries for health reasons. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Hamilton for his work on the inquiries.</P>
      <P>As regards the balance of Mr. Wilson's recommendations, I am now finalising a detailed implementation plan, based on the consultations which have taken place, and I intend to submit this to Government very shortly for approval.</P>

I understand that proceedings have commenced in 20 of these cases.</P>
      <P>As the House will appreciate, the number of murders recorded in 1997, 1998 and 1999 is in fact lower than the number recorded in 1996 and 1995, which was 43 and 42 respectively.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements for the investigation of murder and manslaughter cases are satisfactory and I am informed by the Garda authorities that all such crimes are investigated to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the discussions on the subject of &ldquo;Advance considerations of sentencing where an accused pleads guilty&rdquo; which took place at the national prosecutor's conference held in Dublin Castle on May 20 this year. Speakers on this subject addressed the conference on the case for and the case against plea negotiations. The speaker referred to by the Deputy spoke in favour of plea negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law already recognises the desirability of guilty persons entering a guilty plea at an early stage to spare the victim and to save court time. Section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, sets out as factors which a court may take into account <Col N="1180" /> in determining the sentence to be passed when pleas of guilty are entered, the time they are entered and the circumstances in which they are entered.</P>
    <P>However, the situation to which the speaker in question referred is where discussions might take place between a judge and defence and prosecution counsel in private as to what penalty should be imposed on the defendant in the event of a guilty plea. Such a practice would have to be considered in light of Article 34.1 of the Constitution which requires justice to be administered in public.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions in a direction issued to the Chief State Solicitor and State solicitors in June 1998 instructed that any such practice should be discontinued, at least as far as prosecution counsel are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its report on sentencing [LRC-1998] expressed serious misgivings about such a practice and indicated that it would make no recommendation for legislation in the area of plea negotiation.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have no proposals to introduce legislation to deal with this type of practice. However, I understand the Attorney General intends to take soundings on the general subject of sentencing.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has to bring forward legislation which would make trespassers, rather than land owners, responsible for establishing the right of occupation in view of the fact the current situation is unfair and very onerous for private land owners as in most cases the criminal law is neither applicable nor effective.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present legal position in relation to trespass on land is that it is a civil wrong and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. In broad terms, that civil wrong may be defined as consisting of intentionally or negligently entering or remaining on, or directly causing anything to come into contact with, land in the possession of another without lawful justification. All of the elements I have just itemised are important in terms of establishing that the civil wrong has been committed.</P>
      <P>I am aware from a parliamentary question which the Deputy asked earlier this week that she would like to see the cost and responsibility of establishing a right of occupation falling on the trespasser rather than on the landowner. However, within the civil code, there is a general principle that there are matters which a plaintiff must establish if he or she is to be successful in any court action and I think we would need to think very seriously before we depart from that principle, other than in the most exceptional of cases. With regard to costs, while it is the case that the award of costs is always within the court's discretion, there is also a general principle that costs follow the event and this would leave the way open for costs to be awarded to a litigant who was successful in obtaining an injunction directed towards securing the departure of those who might be trespassing upon his or her land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminal law provisions dealing with trespass include a range of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The 1971 Act makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, to remain in forcible occupation or to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation. The 1994 Act makes it an offence for a person to enter any building or part of it, includ<Col N="1182" /> ing its vicinity, with intent to commit an offence. It is also an offence for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person, and the gardaí have power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and-or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the gardaí.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals to change the law in this area, my Department will continue to keep it under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>I have not in any way resisted the provision of a training course for prison officers &ndash; or for anybody else for that matter. I am in favour of doing what we can to minimise the threat which racism &ndash; anywhere &ndash; poses. My only concern is to ensure that, whatever courses we provide, are actually of use and are informed by best practice.</P>
      <P>Prisons are a reflection of the society they serve. Ireland is no exception to this and, as the proportion of our population who are not of Irish descent grows, it may be anticipated that the proportion of the prison population of non-Irish descent will also grow.</P>
      <P>Non-nationals in society must be treated with care, justice, dignity and respect. This holds even more so for those non-nationals who, for whatever reason, may find themselves in prison.</P>
      <P>In June of this year the Irish Prisons Service advertised in the national press seeking proposals for a research and training project to determine the nature of intercultural awareness, communication and racial equality in Irish prisons.</P>
      <P>The proposed project will involve the design and implementation of a qualitative research project to elicit the nature of cultural awareness and diversity among a cross-section of prison staff and prisoners. The findings of this project will provide the basis of a cultural awareness training programme for both staff and prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> The outcome of this training will then be evaluated and recommendations made in relation to future practice, procedures and policy.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that my Department has no record of receiving any proposals from the Prison Officers' Association for training courses in race relations. However, I would anticipate that that association would be fully supportive of all efforts made to address this issue.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with this matter in some detail in my reply to earlier questions.</P>
      <P>As I have previously said, the commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner Carty to examine the handling of the original investigation carried out into the death of Mr. Richard Barron. As the assistant commissioner's investigation proceeded, other matters came into the scope of his investigation.</P>
      <P>The investigation initiated by the commissioner turned out to be extremely complex and involved a number of different strands. The assistant commissioner has recently completed his investigation and a file in the matter was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions whose directions are now awaited.</P>
      <P>In addition to the investigation carried out by Assistant Commissioner Carty, the commissioner has appointed Assistant Commissioner Murphy to investigate allegations received through members of this House.</P>
      <P>He has also appointed a chief superintendent to investigate a related matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation.</P>
      <P>The question of the alleged tapping of phones has also been raised.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person referred to by the Deputy was committed to Newtown House under the care of the South Western Area Health Board in Newtownmountkennedy in October 1998 by order of the High Court. Newtown House is a high support unit for emotionally and behaviourally disturbed adolescents.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the appropriate steps were taken by the gardaí to locate the person referred to by the Deputy following receipt of the missing person report. The details, in this regard, are set out below.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person in question absconded on Friday, 28 July 2000 while on work experience as a domestic aid at a nursing home in Bray. Gardaí at Wicklow station were informed of the fact by staff at Newtown House on 28 July 2000 via a telephone call at 8.30 pm and a description was provided. This person had absconded from Newtown House on a number of previous occasions, invariably being located either in the city centre or Dun Laoghaire. For this reason, similar calls were made by the staff of Newtown House on 28 July 2000 to Dun Laoghaire, Bridewell, Store Street and Pearse Street Garda stations. A detailed description and photograph was subsequently transmitted by the staff of Newtown House to these stations on 30 July 2000. The parents of the person who absconded were also notified of the situation.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that on the evening of 31 July 2000, the gardaí were notified of a High Court order made on that date which directed the commissioner and members of the Garda Síochána to search for, arrest, detain and return the person referred to, to Newtown House. Her description was subsequently circulated nation-wide from Garda headquarters on 1 August 2000. There is no report of any subsequent Garda sighting prior to her death on 24 August 2000. I understand that on the 10 August she indicated in a telephone call to a care worker at Newtown House that she had been twice stopped and on another occasion chased by gardaí. No evidence to support this has, however, emerged. In the course of that call she also intimated that she did not intend returning to Newtown House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the morning of Thursday, 24 August 2000, she was found in a collapsed state in a room at a guesthouse in Talbot Street, and was sub<Col N="1185" /> sequently pronounced dead. She was not a registered guest.</P>
    <P>There is further detail available to the gardaí and also further Garda investigations under way to elicit the precise whereabouts of this young girl during the entire period since she absconded on 28 July 2000. It would not be appropriate, however, pending the submission of all the information to the city coroner &ndash; when it is all available &ndash; to make further comment and I am sure the Deputies will appreciate the reasons for this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 51 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>At present only those Garda stations which took part in the pilot trials of electronic recording have facilities for audio-video recording Garda interviews with detained persons. There are six such stations as follows: Tallaght, Bridewell, Cork, Bridewell, Dublin, Portlaoise, Henry Street, Limerick, and Mill Street, Galway.</P>
      <P>Following the recommendations of the steering committee which had been established to examine and report on the feasibility of electronically recording Garda interviews with suspects at Garda stations, the Government decided that a system of audio-video recording of such interviews should be introduced on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An implementation committee is planning and overseeing the practical steps which must be taken in this regard. It is envisaged that facilities for audio-video recording will be installed in approximately 150 Garda stations and that more <Col N="1186" /> than 300 interview rooms in these stations will need to be refurbished and fitted to facilitate the audio-video equipment needed. Tenders have been received this week for the supply of the specialised audio-video recording equipment needed. These are being examined and an order will be placed shortly. A planned training programme for gardaí in the use of the new equipment and the procedures relating thereto also needs to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I understand that arrangements in relation to all of these matters are well advanced. At the outset, the aim is to have sufficient stations so equipped in all Garda divisions to give broad national coverage as soon as is practical. I would hope that this would be achieved early next year.</P>

      <P>Since I took office, I have received over 40 representations from members of the Oireachtas in respect of Judicial appointments. Eight persons, on whose behalf representations were made, were subsequently appointed, all to the District Court bench.</P>
      <P>I do not regard these representations as particularly relevant because it has been the practice of this Government and the previous Government to make appointments solely from the list submitted by the Judiciary Appointments Advisory Board as provided for under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>I believe it is important to refer to the fourth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which dealt with the courts and the Judiciary and which the Government is currently considering. The committee took the view that our present system of appointing judges should be retained. The report went on to say that because judicial candidates were already short-listed by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board strictly on merit, the Government could not be open to criticism that it appoints only its own supporters rather than suitably qualified persons when it chooses from the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it is appropriate that, as the Executive of the elected representatives of the people, the Government <Col N="1187" /> should retain the final decision in these matters as provided for under Articles 35.1 and 13.9 of the Constitution. It is therefore difficult to avoid a situation where public representatives continue to recommend to Ministers candidates for these positions. It is part and parcel of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am not convinced that it would be right or indeed lawful to exclude a candidate from judicial office because representations had been made on his or her behalf, given that there could be cases where the recommendation was made without the knowledge of the candidate involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations on the Refugee Legal Service were contained in a report on civil legal aid in Ireland published by the Family Law and Civil Legal Aid Committee of the Law Society in June 2000. These recommendations are being considered by my Department and the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Legal Service was established in February 1999 and provides a comprehensive and quality legal service to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process regardless of whether the application is dealt with substantively or as a manifestly unfounded application.</P>
      <P>Legal services are provided by staff in the RLS and, in appeal cases, by private practitioners who are on a panel set up by the Legal Aid Board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Legal advice is available from the RLS for the initial completion of the asylum application questionnaire; preparation for the initial interview; attendance at the interview, if the Legal Aid Board considers that attendance is required; review of the interview notes after the interview; making of post interview submissions within the five day time limit; advising an applicant of the decision at first instance and of the options open to the applicant; immigration matters, including leave to remain; and deportation matters.</P>
      <P>Legal aid is available for representation before the appeals authorities and judicial review at any stage of the process.</P>
      <P>As regards judicial review, applications are regarded as priorities, and specific resources have been provided to deal with these cases and arrangements are being finalised to ensure that the board is in a position to provide services within the 14 day time period, including special arrangements for the holding of internal appeal committee meetings. Finally, I am assured by the board that it is satisfied that all relevant decisions on applications for legal aid can be taken in sufficient time so as to enable proceedings to be issued within the relevant time periods.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am assured that all asylum cases are regarded as priorities and there are no waiting lists for legal services at the RLS.</P>
      <P>Because of the serious consequences of decisions on refugee status for asylum seekers, all persons who seek legal advice for the initial process are provided with that advice, and all persons who seek legal aid for representation before the appeals authorities, are deemed to meet the merits criteria laid down in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>In relation to resources being provided to the service, a figure of £1 million was provided on set up in 1999 and a very considerable increase is anticipated for 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional staff are also being allocated to the RLS. From an original staff complement of 28 when the service was established in 1999, including seven solicitors, an additional 35 staff, including seven additional solicitors, were sanctioned in March 2000. Significant additional resources are <Col N="1189" /> being sought by my Department for the RLS at the present time as part of the Government's strategy to speed up the processing of asylum applications and to clear the existing number of applications on hands.</P>
    <P>In relation to the private practitioners service, the Legal Aid Board uses private practitioners to provide legal aid in cases at the appeals stage. There are currently 35 solicitors on the panel which are based in various parts of the State. The fee paid under the scheme is currently under review. Salaried solicitors also provide services at all stages of the process.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Government decision to disperse asylum seekers around the country, the board obtained additional staff so as to provide a dispersed Refugee Legal Service. Arrangements are under way for the setting up of sub offices of the Refugee Legal Service in Galway, Cork, Rosslare and Athlone. In addition, provision has been made for staff of the RLS to travel to dispersed locations.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that this reply illustrates the very significant service being provided by the RLS and the ongoing commitment by the Government to the development of that service to meet the ongoing needs of asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000, it is not lawful for any person, with some exceptions such as firearms dealers, to have in his or her possession, use or carry a firearm unless such possession is authorised by a firearm certificate granted under the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power to grant or refuse to grant a firearm certificate to any person resident in the State is <Col N="1190" /> vested in the superintendent of the Garda district where the person resides.

    <P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that, arising from the Garda Síochána's duty of care towards members of the public, the new firearm storage requirements have been put in place by the Garda Síochána solely to increase public safety .</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the new requirements were challenged recently in the High Court by way of an application for judicial review. I understand that it is expected that the hearing of the judicial review will take place before the end of the year. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the second progress report on the Government strategy for road safety was published by the high level group on road safety last July. The report showed that the downward trend in road deaths and serious injuries continued in 1999 towards the primary target of the strategy. The number of people killed on our roads decreased from 472 in 1997 to 413 in 1999 which represents a 12.5% reduction. The number of people seriously injured also decreased by more than 15%: down from 2,182 in 1997 to 1,849 in 1999. However, there is no room for complacency and particularly in view of the continuing high levels of road deaths this year which Government and the Garda authorities remain determined to tackle in co-operation with all the agencies involved in road safety.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware the Garda Síochána in 1997, established the Garda National Traffic Bureau, headed by a chief superintendent, whose primary role is to formulate proactive enforcement strategies aimed at reducing deaths and serious injury accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the establishment of the Garda National Traffic Bureau, the gardaí launched Operation Lifesaver on 14 July 1997 in the Louth-Meath division and subsequently extended this <Col N="1191" /> campaign nationwide. Operation Lifesaver involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks in addition to an extensive road safety publicity campaign, using national and local radio stations including schools programmes which are designed to educate all road users of the need to exercise care on our roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to Garda enforcement in relation to speeding, in 1999 a total of 178,009 on the spot fines were issued and there were 30,105 prosecutions. In the year 2000 up to 30 September, a total of 165,000 on the spot fines for speeding were issued by the gardaí. There were 8,823 prosecutions for drink driving in 1999 and 7,022 arrests for this offence up to the end of September 2000. With regard to seat belt offences a total of 25,000 fines were issued by the gardaí in 1999 and in excess of 40,000 such fines were issued to end of September 2000.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that in the year 2000, the Garda National Traffic Bureau launched a series of short intensive campaigns with specific targets to complement Operation Lifesaver, that is, Operation Road Runner during parts of April and May, which focused specifically on speeding. Operation Samhraidh coincided with the holiday high season from 13 July to 3 September last and Operation Belt-up which operated from 1 to 7 May, and 29 May to 4 June, and which focused on seat belt offences were other operational initiatives. Other week-long intensive campaigns focused on motorcyclists, heavy goods vehicles and traffic light infringements.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's proposal to establish a dedicated Garda traffic corps, I should state that there is a traffic corps in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. In addition, all uniformed gardaí throughout the State are involved in traffic law enforcement as required. Although primary responsibility of the traffic corps is accident prevention and traffic control, members of the corps deal with all matters which require Garda attention.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, members of the traffic corps possess a range of sophisticated traffic offence detection equipment, including in car videos, radar speed guns, tripod mounted radar and a number of unmarked GATSO &ndash; a mobile unit with on board radar, camera and computer equipment &ndash; vans.</P>
    <P>As of now I can inform the House that there are no plans to establish a dedicated traffic corps.</P>

To date, no changes in the law have resulted from these reviews. Nevertheless, I recently announced a further review of the legislation in my Department. While I cannot at this stage predict a timescale, I hope to conclude the review as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report entitled Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV in Irish Prisoners: Prevalence and Risk which my Department published in August 1999. The report was based on research commissioned by the Prisons Service and is a valuable and frank survey of one of the most challenging problems facing the Prisons Service. It must be remembered, however, that the declared personal drug histories by participants in surveys of this kind cannot be totally relied upon as accurate in all instances. This should particularly be borne in mind in relation to claims by survey participants to have first started injecting in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure you that both I and the director general of the Prisons Service are fully committed to tackling the drug problem in the prison system. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treat<Col N="1193" /> ment in the prison system which I approved last year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan.</P>
    <P>At my request, the director general of the Prisons Service established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, senior Prisons Service management and the Probation and Welfare Service. The group invited submissions, <i>via</i> newspaper advertisements, from the general public as well as from special interest groups in relation to its review.</P>
    <P>The steering group submitted its first report to me in July 2000. The report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback and has been submitted to Government for approval. A decision on the recommendations contained in the report will be made by Government in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that 16,100 age cards have been issued as of the beginning of October 2000 and an average of 150 applications are being received daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I officially launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities. All relevant bodies in the drinks industry were invited to the launch and attended it. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the following steps have been taken to promote the use of the age card: all Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters; a poster campaign has been initiated to target all pubs, stand alone off-licences and grocery based off-licences, night-clubs and dance halls, etc; youth information centres and youth groups nationwide have been issued with information, posters and contact numbers for further support; Garda juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí are visiting post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects, etc highlighting the age card scheme; there is on-going liaison between the drinks industry and the Garda Síochana and new avenues of ensuring <Col N="1194" /> young people get the age card message are being explored.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, already contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the problem of under age drinking. The primary purpose of these provisions is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it in any place other than a private residence. Under this legislation it is an offence for a licence holder to sell or deliver alcohol to a person under 18 years of age and for a person over 18 years to purchase it for consumption by a person under 18 years, unless the alcohol is consumed in a private residence. In so far as legislation can contribute to combating abuse of alcohol by young persons, the controls provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, are generally regarded as going as far as criminal legislation could reasonably be expected to go.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, came into effect on 6 July 2000. This wide-ranging Act amends the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1999, and the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1999. It provides for significant extension of licensing hours and wide-reaching changes in the licensing system. It also provides for considerable strengthening of the law on under age drinking.</P>
    <P>With a view to strengthening those provisions which already exist in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under age persons, I have abolished the defence of reasonable belief in any proceedings against the licensee, increased the fines for breaches of the law on under age drinking and provided for a new penalty &ndash; a mandatory temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to under age persons.</P>
    <P>These additional provisions, in conjunction with the national age card scheme, which was introduced in April 1999, will further strengthen the hand of all agencies in the fight against under age drinking. However, it must be borne in mind that while legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of under age drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the under age drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone &ndash; the drinks industry, the creative media and, in particular, parents, must also play their part in helping to address that side of the problem.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the judicial committee established in response to the sixth report of the working group on a courts commission is also currently examining the question of judicial conduct and ethics with a view to publishing a separate report. I look forward to receiving that report and together with the work of the all-party committee, the Government will be in a position to finalise its consideration of all the constitutional and other issues involved in this important area.</P>

      <P>I have received the report on civil legal aid in Ireland prepared by the Family Law and Civil Legal Aid Committee of the Law Society. My Department has been in touch with the Legal Aid Board about the report and the matter is receiving consideration. I understand that the board will contact the society on the matter in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, was enacted to provide legal advice and assistance to persons of modest means at little cost. To be eligible for legal services an applicant must satisfy a means test in relation to their disposable income. In this regard I understand that already the vast majority of social welfare recipients qualify for the provision of legal advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>However, in accordance with section 13(4) of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations, 1996, &ldquo;an applicant whose disposable capital exceeds £200,000 shall not be eligible to obtain legal aid or advice&rdquo;. I consider that this condition would be of relevance to only a small proportion of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board, through its strategic management initiative, is constantly seeking to improve the service that it provides. As regards the proposals contained in the report in relation to the persons who have already passed a means tests, I am aware of the proposed Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' REACH project, which is currently at the design stage. In consultation with the Legal Aid Board, I will keep developments on foot of this project under review to ensure that services provided to the public under the Civil Legal Aid Act are as user friendly as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The PULSE project has been ongoing for four years and will be fully implemented in 2001. PULSE has resulted in very significant changes for Garda operations. An Garda Síochána now have a state of the art system which provides major benefits to policing. Streamlined information flows facilitate improved criminal intelligence and paperwork has been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>I understand that initial teething difficulties have now all been ironed out and that systems are performing to target.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that there are no PULSE problems preventing gardaí in Dublin and other urban areas from inputting crime reports on the system and that there are no problems which would be likely to impact on the reliability of Garda crime statistics. PULSE data entry has been fully decentralised from Dublin since July 2000 when data entry training targets for decentralised data entry were reached.</P>
      <P>Regarding the cost of the project, the position is that the contracted cost agreed at the commencement of the project in August 1996 was approximately £36 million. This later rose to approximately £43.5 million because of the need for additional scope and because of a shortfall in the numbers of Garda staff who could be made available to work on the project. It is estimated that the final cost of the project will be something over £46 million.</P>

      <P>Three Garda CCTV systems have been installed to date in the State &ndash; in Temple Bar, Dublin North Central and Tralee in County Kerry. Recently the CCTV system in Dublin North Central which encompasses the O'Connell Street and adjoining areas was increased from 38 to 42 cameras and the CCTV system in Pearse Street, Dublin South Central is currently being increased from nine to 24 cameras.</P>
      <P>It is also important to remember that Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing Garda resources. As such, they must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are considered by the CCTV advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. To date, the advisory committee has received in excess of 40 applications for Garda CCTV systems, as aids to policing. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems. These are in alphabetical order: Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick. The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin South Central to include Grafton Street and its surrounding areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork City are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The remaining applications are under consideration.</P>
      <P>Our experience to date of Garda CCTV systems shows that it has an important role to play in crime prevention and detection as well as in reassuring the public. The Garda authorities have confirmed its success and advised that assaults, drug dealing, &ldquo;on street crime&rdquo; and so forth have dropped very appreciably where the cameras are in place. CCTV systems have also addressed a number of policing problems &ndash; syringe attacks on tourists and at ATM's, anti-social behaviour &ndash; and have proved vital to the success of a number of Garda operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects while the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I therefore decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>

      <P>One of the key priorities of An Action Programme for the Millennium is that centrally organised State services will be decentralised to ensure that each region gets its fair share of national expenditure on Government administration. The question of offices appropriate for consideration in the context of the decentralisation programme is a matter to be decided by the Government. Pending the outcome of discussions at Cabinet level the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to give details of offices which may be decentralised. It would be inappropriate at this point to pre-empt the outcome of any discussions on the matter by the Government.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware of the interest expressed by many organisations and representatives in towns and cities around the country in being considered as potential locations for decentralised Government offices. However, in assessing the suitability of any particular office for relocation it is envisaged that the selection process will require careful consideration to ensure that the decentralisation strategy has optimum effect.</P>
      <P>My Department has over the years pursued a policy of relocation. The finance division transferred to Killarney in 1989 and in 1997 part of the Land Registry decentralised to Waterford. Both transfers have been very successful.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of developments in recent months regarding the decentralisation of the head office of the Legal Aid Board to Cahirciveen.</P>
      <P>The site for the new head office building has been purchased. The Office of Public Works is currently analysing tender documentation received from contractors to design and build the new premises and I expect that a decision will be made very shortly in this regard.</P>
      <P>Both staff and their representative unions are being kept fully informed of all developments in relation to the proposed move to Cahirciveen. I understand that management has also advised the unions that any request from them for discussion on matters arising from the transfer will be promptly facilitated.</P>
      <P>The proposed number of staff to be located in Cahirciveen is 39 but when account is taken of the staff at dual locations, the total number of staff working from the Cahirciveen base will be 42. I am not prepared to depart from the normal practice of not disclosing the precise numbers and grades of those who do not have an interest in transferring to Cahirciveen, lest those who have expressed such a wish be identified. However, a number of staff serving in the Legal Aid Board have expressed an interest in transferring to Caherciveen and others have indicated an interest in moving in the event of promotional opportunities becoming available. Staff of the board who do not wish to move to Cahirciveen will be redeployed throughout the Civil Service to take the places of those civil servants who successfully apply for decentralised positions in Cahirciveen.</P>
      <P>As regards recruitment the position is that the Legal Aid Board, in accordance with normal decentralisation procedures, requested the Department of Finance to issue an interdepartmental circular seeking applications from persons throughout the Civil Service who would be willing to transfer to the Legal Aid Board for permanent transfer to Cahirciveen. Following prior consultation with the relevant staff unions that circular issued last June. Within a month the board received a very satisfactory response and is currently in the process of recruiting staff who have applied to transfer to Cahirciveen. Some officers have already transferred to the board and further transfers will take place over the coming months. The Deputy will appreciate that at this early stage in the proceedings it is not possible to give any indication of whether it will be necessary to recruit new staff. However, I expect that this information will become apparent towards the latter part of the current recruitment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to provide the Deputy at this stage with details of the total cost of the move to <Col N="1202" /> Cahirciveen as matters including the tender process for the provision of the new headquarters building have yet to be finalised. However, in the short to medium term there will be a saving to the Exchequer arising out of the move to Cahirciveen because there will be a reduction in rental outlay following completion of the decentralisation.</P>

      <P>Asylum seekers entering the country at present have their needs met under the system of direct provision currently in operation. Direct provision for the most part represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers are also entitled to a range of other services while waiting to have their applications processed. For example, subject to satisfying means tests, asylum seekers are entitled to allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and medical cards. They are entitled to the same health services as Irish medical card holders and the children of asylum seekers can avail of free primary and secondary education.</P>
      <P>The introduction of direct provision on 10 April 2000 brought Ireland into line with other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom who introduced direct provision on 1 April, and followed thorough investigation and careful planning. This system represents a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum population.</P>

      <Quest>when he will bring legislative proposals to Government to establish, on a statutory basis, the new agency to deal with the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees; the terms of reference of the agency; if the agency will be independent of his Department; if it will have its own budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 March 2000 the Government agreed with my recommendations for a statutory agency, under the aegis of my Department, to be called the reception and integration agency. Pending the enactment of legislation the agency will operate on a non-statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommend<Col N="1204" /> ations of the working group. The reception and integration agency will be the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment will facilitate a cohesive, co-ordinated approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees. The agency will have responsibility for: planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time; for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government this time last year.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government to put the reception and integration agency on a statutory basis as soon as other legislative priorities permit. As the Government has not yet had the opportunity to consider any such proposals, any definitive comment by me at this stage in relation to delegation of authority or budgetary control would be inappropriate. However, in line with the Government's strategic management initiative and the approach adopted in relation to other agencies in the Justice area, my intention is that the reception and integration agency will have operational independence in its day to day activities, have its own board and its own budget.</P>

      <P>The Garda Commissioner and I are totally committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse, including heroin abuse.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of tough legislation, backed up by strong law enforcement measures, in tandem with a multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage will ultimately prove successful.</P>
      <P>The Garda are tackling both the major drug trafficking groups and street level drug dealing as well as dealing with the international aspects of drug trafficking. The major trafficking groups are constantly being targeted and a number of significant internationally driven seizures have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a concerted drive to tackle street level drug dealing utilising Garda operations such as Dóchas, cleanstreet, mainstreet and nightcap. In a recent phase of Operation Cleanstreet concentrated in Dublin city, a total of 144 persons were identified as being involved in the sale of heroin. On 25 September last, 44 of these <Col N="1206" /> persons were arrested and charged. I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is expected that the remainder will be dealt with in a like fashion in the near future.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has informed me that there have been 24 reported cases of severe inflammatory infection of heroin users since May 2000 and eight of these patients have died. A bacterium, clostridium novyi, was isolated from two of those who died. The findings in Dublin taken together with the findings from a similar outbreak in Glasgow indicated that what happened in May and June was that contaminated heroin was injected into muscle tissue by those drug users who became infected. Clostridium novyi is an anaerobic bacterium which is present in soil. It needs a very particular environment to survive and, if injected into muscle, can lead to severe infection. Its spores can survive dormant for a long period of time.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is continuing its investigation regarding the nature and cause of the infection in drug users and has alerted all accident and emergency departments in Dublin city to be on the lookout for any similar type of infections. The three area health boards in the eastern region continue to highlight the dangers of drug use and injecting into muscle.</P>
    <P>Investigations by the gardaí into a number of deaths associated with drug misuse are ongoing.</P>

      <P>My Department's records indicate that the total number of asylum applicants awaiting a final determination on their asylum applications as at 31 August 2000 is 12,875. This figure takes account of all applications made up to that date.</P>
      <P>The current processing time for processing asylum applications from initial application stage to the determination of an appeal, in cases where applicants avail of the opportunity to appeal, takes between four months, &ndash;  manifestly unfounded cases &ndash; and two years. In cases where there is no appeal the processing time is between four to 15 months. If there is a further challenge to a deportation order and/or the asylum process, the period could extend to a further two years.</P>
      <P>The aim of my Department is to minimise the time taken from the date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards and enables applications to be processed within six months. As an illustration of this commitment, I announced recently that I have obtained approval for the recruitment of 370 additional staff for, <i>inter alia</i>, the asylum case processing and appeals areas.</P>
      <P>There are 32 judicial review cases in regard to asylum matters currently before the courts. These 32 cases involve 85 applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 688 deportation orders have been made, over 90% of which are in respect of failed <Col N="1208" /> asylum seekers, under the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, up to 4 October 2000. Six persons were deported in 1999 and a further 78 have been deported in 2000. In addition a further five persons left the State before the deportation orders could be enforced. In the remaining cases, 126 persons evaded deportation orders, 170 persons were not at their last known address for the purposes of service, 91 have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts, 123 persons will have to have their return negotiated with the authorities in their countries of origin and arrangements for deportation are being made in a further 61 cases. Deportation orders in respect of the remaining 28 cases are being, or have been, revoked, primarily on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>As I have already informed the Deputy, 91 persons who were the subject of deportation orders have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts. A further seven persons, whose cases had not reached the stage where a deportation order had been made but who have completed the asylum process, have also been granted leave to seek judicial review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, provides for a package of measures aimed at protecting the public, in particular children, from sexual abuse or attack. The main provision of the Bill will be the creation of a sex offenders register, or tracking system as it is also known. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the Dáil and I hope the remaining Stages will be passed to allow the register to come into operation before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registration or notification obligation will cover all those who, on or after commencement of the Act, are convicted or found guilty but insane of a sexual offence specified in the Schedule to the Bill and those who are, on commencement, still in contact with the criminal justice system, whether awaiting sentence, in prison, subject to supervision, serving a community service order or detained in the Central Mental Hospital. Further retrospection would be impossible without compromising the accuracy of the records; it would simply not be possible to trace all those offenders no longer in contact with the criminal justice system. The issue of retrospectivity is dealt with in the Bill in the following way. If such a <Col N="1209" /> person were to act in such a way as to pose a risk of serious harm to the public, the gardaí could apply to the court under Part III of the Bill for a sex offender order and the making of such an order, apart from the other consequences of the order, would automatically make the person liable to the notification requirement.</P>
    <P>The Bill's enactment will ensure that the Garda Síochána will have up to date information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. This in itself should act as a deterrent to reoffending and so contribute towards their rehabilitation. In addition, the availability of up to date data will be of particular benefit to the gardaí in the investigation and prevention of sexual crimes.</P>
    <P>The sex offenders group treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of my Department. It can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of the damage done to local communities by the scourge of so called joyriding. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1993, as enforced by them, are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner.</P>
      <P>I am determined to see that the Garda have all the resources they need to effectively tackle joyriding. As of the end of September, Garda strength stood at 11,600 and I am well on target to meet the Government's target of 12,000 by 2002. The Garda fleet has also increased substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they continually monitor trends in unauthorised takings with a view to identifying and targeting both persistent offenders and areas prone to such activities. Some of the local responses to joyriding include Operation Steering Wheel which was developed by the Garda authorities to deal specifically with the problem of joyriding in Coolock. The operation is ongoing and comprises uniform, foot and mobile patrols targeting specific locations on a nightly basis. A special resource unit comprising one sergeant and eight gardaí was <Col N="1210" /> established to specifically target incidents of joyriding in west Tallaght. The autocrime diversion project, under the auspices of the probation and welfare services, plays a role in addressing the problem in Cork. Each Garda division also has a traffic unit who outside of peak traffic hours target incidents of joyriding.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, I have significantly expanded the number of Garda youth diversion projects, with a view to diverting juveniles away from this type of crime. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has allocated £16 million over the life of the national development plan to establish further projects throughout the country. These projects involve not only the gardaí but also local community groups and other agencies. I am also informed that juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí avail of every opportunity during the course of their work, particularly in implementing the schools programme to educate young people to the dangers posed by joyriding. The gardaí are also involved in the south Dublin inter-agency steering group on joyriding and anti-social activity, and also in a task force to address the problem in the Coolock area.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives the garda are promoting to deal with joyriding include the crime prevention through environmental design concept, which involves a Garda crime prevention officer liaising with local authorities, town planners and communities at the development stage of new estates and parks. This can involve effecting physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, a wide range of measures are being deployed by the Garda Síochána to combat the problem of joyriding and to discharge its role in maintaining law and order. I am further assured that the Garda have in the past and will continue to be proactive in dealing with such problems both by way of direct action through detection and prevention through the numerous diversion and referral schemes.</P>

      <P>A commitment has been given in the Government's legislative programme to publish a disabilities Bill in 2001. Preparatory work is under way in my Department and a broad ranging consultation process is due to be completed early in the autumn. The disabilities Bill will be the fourth legislative measure in the area of disability equality sponsored by this Government and is being progressed in the context of the legislative and infrastructual framework for equality which the Government has already put in place. The Employment Equality Act, 1998 and Equal Status Act, 2000 outlaw discrimination in the workplace and in the supply of goods and services on nine grounds including the ground of disability. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999 provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority. The NDA was established on 12 June this year as part of the policy of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities. The Equality Authority and the Equality Investigation's Office were established on a statutory basis on 18 October 1999.</P>
      <P>These measures are in many respects ground breaking and in advance of best practice adopted elsewhere. It is my intention that the disabilities Bill will be similarly developmental and will be geared to achieving and underpinning the participation of people with disabilities in society.</P>

      <P>In common with my colleagues from other EU member states, I am concerned with the threat posed by organised crime groups from Central and Eastern Europe. The transition from centrally planned, command economies to the free market system has exacerbated and made more apparent the conditions for the development and operation of organised crime in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Measures are being taken both at EU and bilateral levels to strengthen the capacity of the applicant countries to prevent and combat organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pre-accession pact on organised crime between the member states of the European Union and the applicant countries was adopted on 28 May 1998. Under this pact, a pre-accession <Col N="1212" /> pact expert group meets on an ongoing basis to progress the pact and to discuss matters of common interest in relation to combating organised crime. A specific chapter of the European Union strategy for the prevention and control of organised crime for the beginning of the new millennium relates to strengthening co-operation with the applicant countries. This chapter emphasises that a truly effective EU strategy must look beyond the member states of the EU and includes five primary recommendations in relation to organised crime.</P>
    <P>In addition, a collective evaluation working party has been established and has been assessing the progress being made by the applicant countries towards adopting the EU acquis in the justice and home affairs sphere. Funding is available under the EU's PHARE programme to assist them in adopting the European Union acquis, including the justice and home affairs elements.</P>
    <P>At a bilateral level, Ireland has signed a co-operation agreement with the Republic of Hungary on drugs and other serious crime and negotiations on a similar agreement with the Republic of Poland have been completed at official level. Requests to enter into similar co-operation agreements have been received from a number of the other applicant countries and these are currently being examined within my Department.</P>
    <P>I believe that these ongoing developments provide the most appropriate means for dealing with this issue.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 26 July 1997 the person in question, now deceased, was arrested and detained at the Bridewell Garda station under the provisions of section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. I am further informed that his arrest and detention related to a double murder at Grangegorman, Dublin 7, on 6-7 March 1997.</P>
      <P>The facts of the case as outlined to me by the gardaí are that soon after his arrest and detention, the person in question made a full admission to investigating officers of his alleged involvement in a double murder. This admission was recorded on audio video tape as provided for under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Later on that same date the person in question made a further detailed admission of his alleged involvement in the murders. This interview was not audio video recorded at the persons own request. I understand that his request for the discontinuance of the electronic recording of the interview was also captured on audio video.</P>
    <P>Following consultation between the gardaí and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions the person in question was charged with the murder of Mary Callinan and he appeared before a special sitting of the Dublin District Court and was remanded in custody.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the manner in which the person in question was interviewed was in compliance with the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997 which came into operation on 1 March 1997.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, as a result of matters emanating from another quarter, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to carry out an investigation to establish the veracity of the statements of admission.</P>
    <P>I understand that a thorough investigation was carried out and a comprehensive file submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director, having considered the file, directed that criminal proceedings against the person in question be discontinued. Proceedings were subsequently terminated in the Dublin District Court on 29 April 1998.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that a probative inquiry ordered by the Commissioner was conducted by an assistant commissioner, who forwarded a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The investigation established that the regulations as contained in the Treatment of Persons in Custody (in Garda Síochána Stations Regulations), 1987, were complied with in full in respect of the prisoner, the person in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 350 convicted sex offenders in custody in Irish prisons on Tuesday, 26 September 2000.</P>
      <P>Public discussion and commentary about the issue of the treatment of sex offenders frequently implies that the dedicated sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill prison is the only form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in Irish prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders <Col N="1214" /> within the Irish prison system. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service. This is a largely demand led service to individual prisoners who ask for help. The second intervention is a multidisciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork prison and Arbour Hill prison since 1998. The third intervention which tends to receive most media coverage is the extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill prison and which is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of the Department. This programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender. All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this programme. The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and a call-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises.</P>
    <P>Many of the sex offenders currently in custody are participating in one or more of the forms of intervention referred to earlier. Ten prisoners are undertaking the dedicated treatment programme, referred to earlier, in Arbour Hill prison.</P>
    <P>I have asked the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. A working group chaired by the director general and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh which accommodates approximately 100 sex offenders.</P>
    <P>A thinking skills programme has already been introduced in the Curragh. An intensive sex offenders group treatment programme, drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme will be introduced in November this year.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork prison early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multidisciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service. The skills taught in <Col N="1215" /> this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts, views and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. This programme is considered by the director general and his advisers to be the preferred first line of approach to rehabilitating sex offenders in custody as in many cases it builds up their frequently low personal motivation to address offending behaviour in depth.</P>
    <P>When the intensive sex offenders group treatment programme is introduced in the Curragh during the current year it will be operated by the probation and welfare service and psychology service in the same mode as the current Arbour Hill programme.</P>
    <P>A steering group to put in place multidisciplinary prisoner programmes was established recently. This group chaired by a senior prison governor comprises representatives from the Department, senior prisons service management, probation and welfare service, psychology service, prisons education and the POA. Its first task will be to oversee the establishment of a new rehabilitative programme for sex offenders. This programme will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team consisting of prison officers, psychologists, probation and welfare staff and teachers. To this end the Irish Prisons Service has recruited the services of a research psychologist to assist in the development of this programme. This work is expected to be completed in the new year.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective for the Irish Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions including Ireland that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or indeed legal option in such cases.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government's programme of development co-operation is delivered through three principal channels: direct development partnerships with a limited number of programme or priority countries, delivery of aid through multilateral organisations such as the EU, the UN system and the World Bank; and delivery of aid through non-governmental organisations and other partner organisations for smaller long-term development projects and programmes and for emergency <Col N="1218" /> responses. This approach, and the mix of activities made possible, is perceived as providing the optimum means of responding to the diverse and emerging needs of developing countries.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government's programme of development co-operation recognises the important role which NGOs play in development efforts throughout the developing world. Their contribution to work at grassroots level and in emergency situations is particularly noteworthy. The bilateral programme has built strong and solid relationships with Irish NGOs and missionary orders over the years. In 1998 £20.7 million was channelled for development through NGOs. In 1999 this increased to £24.6 million. These figures are indicative of the belief which the Irish Government has in the capacity of NGOs to reach the poor and marginalised and in building the capacity of these groups to determine their own development.</P>
      <P>In a situation of increased funding, such as that committed by the Taoiseach at the Millennium Summit on 6 September, the role of NGOs can and should be strengthened. We are currently considering the introduction of multi-annual funding for the larger NGOs which are already in receipt of block grants. This will facilitate better planning of their development activities and provide a greater measure of assurance regarding funding levels. This more strategic approach will also facilitate a greater focus on the quality of outcomes and impact of development projects and programmes. We will work with all NGOs to build an even more robust partnership with them and indeed with the various strands of civil society with an interest in development. The search for sustainable development through quality interventions and the adoption of best practice is a collective endeavour.</P>
      <P>In the context of the expanding aid programme a review is being undertaken with a view to providing the best possible basis for the planned expansion and development of the enlarged programme. This process will, include,<i> inter alia</i>, consultations with the main NGOs and also the smaller ones represented by Dochas, the representative body for Irish development NGOs.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the town renewal scheme as the urban renewal scheme was approved by the EU Commission in June 1999 and the business elements of that scheme were introduced with effect from 1 July 1999. My Department formally notified the EU Commission of the business elements of the new town renewal scheme on 19 July 2000 around the same time as the specific towns selected for this new town renewal scheme were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Commission responded on 6 September with a request for additional information. The matter was discussed in detail with the EU Commission at a meeting on 27 September 2000 and a reply to the Commission is currently being prepared. As things stand at present, it appears that it will take some months before the business tax incentive elements of the scheme will be approved by the EU Commission. Such a delay is normal where EU Commission approval is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted media reports concerning a possible settlement of the litigation involving haemophiliacs infected with HIV and a number of pharmaceutical companies. As the Deputy will appreciate, the State has no involvement in any such negotiations; HIV infected haemophiliacs settled their actions against the State in 1991 and received compensation totalling £8 million. Notwithstanding this, the Government has decided that the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, should be amended to allow persons with haemophilia to claim compensation at the tribunal in respect of their HIV infection. The objective is to enable haemophiliacs to apply for compensation on a similar basis to persons infected with Hepatitis C. Haemophiliacs who are infected with Hepatitis C or co-infected with Hepatitis C and HIV are currently entitled to compensation from the tribunal in respect of their Hepatitis C condition. It is my intention to introduce a Bill to provide for amendments to the 1997 Act during the current Dáil session.</P>
      <P>Representatives of my Department and of the Irish Haemophilia Society have been addressing the various legal issues which arise, including the extent to which compensation received from other sources will be taken into account by the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it is a matter for the relevant county councils to propose sites for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by a town renewal plan. In doing so they are assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them; these set out the purposes and aims of the schemes, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. County councils were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be jus<Col N="1227" /> tified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
    <P>The role of the expert panel set up by me was to assess the local authority's proposals and recommend sub-areas or sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by county councils. In a number of cases additional information was requested from the relevant county council to facilitate examination of the proposals; in the case of Ballinrobe, Mayo County Council was asked to submit additional photographs of a number of the sites. The panel was confined to examining the sites or sub-areas recommended by county councils by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines; this process did not involve the panel carrying out inspections. Therefore the panel did not visit Ballinrobe.</P>
    <P>The building referred to in the Deputy's question was included in a large site containing mainly commercial premises and offices proposed by Mayo County Council for refurbishment tax incentives. In the view of the expert panel, the proposal for the entire site was insufficiently targeted and the case for the incentives was not made.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been brought to the concerns of retired staff associations representing former civil servants; if he has met with representatives of these organisations; his views on whether it is fair to make available certain free schemes to these former employees who are aged over 75 and not to all from the date of retirement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since July 1996 the free schemes are available to low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, currently £96 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £101 for a recipient aged 80 years or over, plus £30, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children, living alone, as appropriate. The make-up of this income limit means that it increases automatically each year on foot of the budget increases in pension rates.</P>
      <P>A review of the free schemes of this Department was published in April of this year. The review was carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. The review included an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target groups and the scope for alternative policy arrangements.</P>
      <P>A core issue was the underlying rationale for schemes of this type and their effectiveness in overcoming poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations arising from the review was that free schemes should be extended to all people over 75 years, regardless of income or household composition. As the Deputy is aware, in this year's budget I provided funding for the implementation of this recommendation with effect from October 2000 at an estimated cost of £1 million for this year and £4 million in a full year. The purpose of this measure is to recognise the value of older people in our society and to support them to remain active in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the issues raised by the Deputy from various submissions and meetings I have had with a range of interest groups, including retired public servants. The position of the free schemes will be kept under consideration in the light of the review. However, any further exten<Col N="1240" /> sion of free schemes would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for participation in the student summer jobs scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test which applies to applicants for unemployment assistance. In assessing means, account is taken of the parents' gross income less income tax, PRSI, superannuation, private health insurance, union fees, rent or mortgage payments and some travel costs. The weekly means of the student are then assessed at 17% of the net family income calculated on this basis.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for participation in the student summer jobs scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test which applies to applicants for unemployment assistance. In assessing means, account is taken of the parents' gross income less income tax, PRSI, superannution, private health insurance, union fees, rent or mortgage payments and some travel costs. The weeks means of the student are then assessed at 17% of the net family income calculated on this basis.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to providing an efficient service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
      <P>There are currently some 2,350 carer's allowance applications awaiting determination, the majority of which are at an advanced stage of processing. The average time for deciding an application for receipt of the allowance is currently in the region of 12 weeks. Any award of the allowance applies, of course, from the date on which application is made.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to carer's allowance there are medical, means and residency conditions to be satisfied and there is inevitably a timelag involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable decisions to be made. The Deputy will also be aware that in recent years there have been a number of very significant improvements to the scheme. The number of persons who now receive a carer's allowance has increased by 44% from 10,330 at the end of December 1997, to 16,125 at the end of September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> The substantial increase in the number of new claims affects the time taken to process claims generally. My understanding, however, is that there have not been significant delays in processing applications for carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Whilst the number of new carer's allowance claims has increased, arrangements have been put in place to process claims as expeditiously as possible. The significantly increased number of claims under the scheme has put additional pressure on the scheme area involved. The level of resources required and the standard for claim processing will be kept under review to ensure that claims receive a good quality service having regard to the conditions governing the scheme.</P>

      <P>I understand from Údarás na Gaeltachta that: the company in question provided employment for between 100 and 200 people for the period of ten and a half years of its existence. Employment peaked at 205 full-time jobs and the average employment over the life of the project was 166 jobs; the organisation paid a total of £1,017,186 in grant aid to the company &ndash; see following table for the details requested; the contingent liability had fully expired on £218,332 of the total grants paid before closure of the plant and could not be reclaimed from the company; and the organisation demanded repayment of those grants on which the contigent liability had not expired, i.e., £798,854 &ndash; £1,017,186 less £218,332 &ndash; and following negotiations it was agreed that the company would repay £600,000 of the grants to an tÚdarás and make a contribution of £50,000 towards the work of the task-force.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the cost to the State is very small. When one calculates the costs per job or per annum of the net grant paid after repayment of the £600,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Since deportations commenced under the Immigration Act, 1999, I have made a total of 688 deportation orders, including 629 in respect of failed asylum seekers. Six persons, of whom four were failed asylum seekers, were deported in 1999 and a further 78 persons, of whom 60 were failed asylum seekers, have been deported in the year 2000 to date. In addition, a further five failed asylum seekers left the State before the deportation orders could be enforced. I am not in a position to confirm whether or not any of the remaining persons have left the State voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following is the position in the relation to the remaining cases: 126 persons, of whom 113 are failed asylum seekers, evaded deportation orders; 170 persons, of whom 167 are failed asylum seekers, were not at their last known address <Col N="1248" /> for the purposes of service; 91 persons, of whom 88 are failed asylum seekers, have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts. Arrangements are being put in place in respect of another 61 persons, of whom 59 are failed asylum seekers. Some 123 persons, all of whom are failed asylum seekers, will have to have their returns negotiated with the authorities in their countries of origin. Deportation orders in respect of the remaining 28 persons, ten of whom are failed asylum seekers, are being, or have been, revoked, primarily on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>

    <P>Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, provides that I may make a deportation order in respect of a person who falls into one or more of nine categories listed at section 3(2), including where an application for asylum has been refused. Where I propose to make a deportation order in respect of a person, I must notify that person in writing of such a proposal and the person has 15 working days to either leave the State voluntarily, consent to be deported or make representations in writing as to why he-she should not be deported.</P>
    <P>Since deportations commenced under the Immigration Act, 1999, I have made a total of 688 deportation orders of which 629 were in respect of failed asylum seekers. The following is the breakdown in respect of those 629 cases: four such persons were deported in 1999 and a further 60 have been deported in the year 2000 to date. In addition, a further five failed asylum seekers left the State before the deportation orders could be enforced.</P>
    <P>The following is the position in relation to the remainder of such persons: 113 evaded deportation orders; 167 were not at their last known address for the purposes of service; 88 persons have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts.

      <P>The report of the Irish Refugee Council entitled Asylum in Ireland: A Report on the Fairness and Sustainability of Asylum Determinations at First Instance is wide ranging and is, of course, worthy of study, even though I do not accept many of its conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Government places a high priority on maintaining an asylum process which is both fair and transparent and which is geared towards providing protection to those in genuine need of such protection as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government is also fully committed to the implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention and this is reflected in both the present administrative procedures for processing asylum applications agreed with the UNHCR and the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which are due to be commenced shortly. Considerable resources are expended annually to ensure that our procedures are in line with best international practice and the highest standards and the application of these procedures has been affirmed by the courts on several occasions. The staff of the Department also receive comprehensive training in the application of the asylum procedures. The Departments procedures include: a first instance decision after interview at which every opportunity and assistance is afforded to an applicant to put forward his or her case for refugee status; a right to an appeal which is heard by one of 14 independent appeals authorities; a right to independent legal advice and assistance from the refugee legal service at various stages in the asylum process.</P>
      <P>This process is being expanded with the implementation in full of the Refugee Act, 1996, shortly which will see the establishment of two new independent offices, namely, the refugee applications commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there are, what the Deputy calls, serious deficiencies in the asylum process. While it is not possible to respond in this reply to each of the reports' recommendations, I would make the following comments on the key recommendations as follows: while, as pointed out in the report, the manifestly unfounded grounds applied in Ireland are extensive, they essentially cover many of the principles applied in other EU member states in more general terms. They are also very much in line with the provisions of the EU resolution on manifestly unfounded applications for asylum as adopted by EU Ministers in <Col N="1252" /> 1992. The manifestly unfounded grounds are to be found in the present administrative procedures for processing asylum applications which were agreed with the UNHCR; the right to an interpreter is extensively recognised and provided for in the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which is due to be commenced in full in the near future. At present, the Department will always provide interpretation where practicable and possible having regard to the fact that for certain languages there is a limited number of interpreters available in the State; staff involved in asylum case processing and appeals are trained to deal with applicants for asylum in a sympathetic manner and with respect and sensitivity and a full awareness of cultural differences. All staff working in the asylum division of my Department, including reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; experience of interviews and assessments. Training programmes are agreed with the UNHCR and delivered by a combination of the Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full time official here. This training includes procedures to be followed when dealing with victims of trauma and violence and other sensitive matters such as gender issues. Furthermore, training on cultural issues is also provided in conjunction with the UNHCR to ensure that staff are aware of the cultural sensitivity of the background of the applicants.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the importance of addressing the special needs of all vulnerable groups including victims of torture, unaccompanied children and those who have suffered from gender based persecution. Our present procedures, which adhere to the UNHCR's recommended practice, reflect the Department's commitment to processing applications for refugee status in accordance with our international obligations with a view to providing the best possible service to all applicants. Extensive training of staff has been undertaken to ensure that each individual asylum applicant is treated with courtesy and professionalism by all members of staff.</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council did approach my Department in February, 2000 in relation to this project. However, as was explained to the council by my Department, as the refugee applications commissioner was due to be appointed, in anticipation of the implementation in full of the Refugee Act, 1996, it was considered that any review of the first instance asylum process, should be a matter for consideration by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>I would like to again emphasise my commitment to the maintenance of a fair and efficient asylum process. This was further underlined recently in the Government's decision to provide some 370 additional staff for asylum case processing and appeals and related repatriations. This will allow the Department to achieve a number of strategic objectives, namely: greatly increasing processing capacity, including appeals, to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to <Col N="1253" /> applications for refugee status leading, in due course, to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period. This should ensure that those who are genuine refugees will receive decisions on their applications much more speedily and that non-genuine applications will also be dealt with on a faster basis; the elimination of the asylum applications currently on hands as soon as possible; dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations which are expected to arise in respect of persons whose applications for refugee status are refused.</P>
    <P>In addition, considerable extra resources have been sought for the refugee legal service to enable it to keep pace with the increased processing capacity being provided in relation to applications for refugee status and to improve the level of service provided to those in dispersed locations.</P>

    <P>Male offenders aged 16 and 17, and up to the age of 21, may be committed on remand or to serve a period of detention at St. Patrick's Institution. Male offenders aged 16 and over may be committed on remand to Cloverhill Prison. Male <Col N="1254" /> offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to the five adult committal prisons, Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick, Castlerea and Portlaoise. Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the five adult committal prisons and from St. Patrick's Institution to Wheatfield Place of Detention, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>Female offenders aged 17 years, and over, may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to Mountjoy and Limerick women's prisons.</P>
    <P>Offenders under the age of 15 years cannot be committed to prison under any circumstances. Fifteen year old male offenders and 15 and 16 year old female offenders can be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances. This can occur only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children's Act, 1908, that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he/she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under part V of the Act.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to segregate juvenile offenders from the general prison population in each institution at all times. The few held in the more traditional adult prisons are accommodated with other young offenders or with carefully selected older prisoners.</P>
    <P>All persons committed from the courts to institutions or prisons under the aegis of this Department are accommodated, none are refused due to limitations on accommodation.</P>
    <P>The number of occasions whereby juvenile offenders, refused bail or sentenced, were detained in Garda stations is as follows: 1999 &ndash; 5; 2000 &ndash; 14.</P>
    <P>The legal provisions for the committal of young offenders under the age of 18 years will change on the enactment of the Children Bill, 1999, which proposes that where a court imposes a period of detention on a child, it shall, where the child is under 16 years of age, order the child to be detained in a children's detention school, operated by the Department of Education and Science; where the child is 16 or 17 years of age, order the child to be detained in a place of detention, provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under the provisions of the Bill, separate, dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders.</P>
    <P>The prisons building programme includes provisions for the following accommodation exclusively for children: 40 place unit with full support facilities on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork Prison. Planning of this project is at an advanced stage and building work will commence in 2001. 100 place unit with full support facilities in the Dublin region comprising separate secure detention for up to 20 females and 80 males.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of these detention centres will be to afford young offenders the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to <Col N="1255" /> avoid future offending by the creative design of high quality purpose built facilities and the provision of high grade support services delivered through a progressive regime tailored to their special needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>A visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925, and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.</P>
      <P>The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison which they are appointed to and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as quality of accommodation, catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. The committees also submit annual reports to me which are subsequently published.</P>
      <P>Members are appointed for a period of three years The maximum number that can be appointed for each institution is 12. Each committee elects their own chairperson. Persons wishing to serve on a visiting committee can make representation to nominate themselves or can be nominated by another person. No person can become a member of a visiting committee if they are in receipt of a salary paid out of the central fund other than a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann. Members of visiting committees receive no remuneration. Travel and subsistence allowances are paid in line with Civil Service rates.</P>
      <P>There are no specific criteria used in selecting individuals for appointment. The composition of each committee is drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible to ensure that the needs of prisoners are understood and met. This is the long standing practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members to the prisons visiting committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was proposed in the Department's five year plan for the management of offenders that a permanent visiting committees chairpersons group be established. The purpose of this group would be to hold formalised meetings to discuss matters of general relevance to the operation of visiting committees and the treatment of prisoners in all of the institutions. The chairpersons group was <Col N="1262" /> established and its inaugural meeting was held on the 4 March 1998.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the composition and proceedings of the visiting committees. They perform a very valuable service and I take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts and hard work.</P>
    <P>As part of the establishment of the Prison Authority there are plans to create the post of inspector of prisons. The role of this inspector will be to report on all prisons and places of detention under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, particularly on conditions in those institutions and on the treatment of the persons held in them. Obviously this role may duplicate some of the existing functions of the visiting committees. The respective functions of the independent prison inspectorate and the visiting committees will require careful definition.</P>
    <P>In the context of the consolidation and modernisation of the prison rules generally, at present under way, the rules governing visiting committees will be revised and updated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The maternity benefit scheme is administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Maternity benefit is payable to employed and self&ndash;employed women who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions on their own insurance record. PRSI contributions at class A, E, H and S count for maternity benefit purposes.</P>
      <P>Civil and public servants, recruited prior to April 1995, do not pay full PRSI contributions, and, therefore, do not qualify for maternity benefit. This category of employee would receive payment during maternity leave from their employer.</P>
      <P>In the private sector, some employers choose to pay their employees their full salary, and to recoup the maternity benefit portion directly from the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current cost of maternity leave provision and the cost of extending maternity leave would include the maternity benefit scheme, payments made by the public sector to employees who do not qualify for maternity benefit, and any extra contractual payments made by the private and public sector to employees in receipt of maternity benefit. Similarly, the number of employees availing of maternity leave would include both those who can avail of the maternity benefit scheme, and those who are paid by other means. It is not <Col N="1263" /> possible to quantify the extra costs to private sector employers, and there are no statistics available on costs across the entire public service. Figures in relation to the maternity benefit scheme are as follows:</P>
    <P>The cost of the maternity benefit scheme in the years 1995-2000: 1995 £27,273,000; 1996 £29,839,000; 1997 £34,058,000; 1998 £38,208,000; 1999 £41,530,000; 2000 £44,300,000 projected cost for the full year.</P>
    <P>The number of maternity benefit claims awarded during the years 1995-2000 is as follows: 1995 &ndash; 15,664; 1996 &ndash; 17,628; 1997 &ndash; 19,796; 1998 &ndash; 22,384; 1999 &ndash; 23,851; 2000 &ndash; 19,004, the actual figure up to 23 September 2000.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of extending the maternity benefit scheme by four weeks, six weeks and ten weeks is as follows: cost of paying four extra weeks maternity benefit £12.66 million; cost of paying six extra weeks maternity benefit £18.99 million; cost of paying ten extra weeks maternity benefit £31.46 million</P>
    <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium prioritises the &ldquo;review and improvement of maternity protection legislation&rdquo; as a key component in achieving true equality for women. In line with this, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commits my Department to set up a working group to review the maternity protection legislation. The working group comprises the social partners, relevant Government Departments and agencies. The group first met on 14 April 2000 and eight meetings have been held to date. The next meeting is scheduled for 13 October and it is hoped to finalise the work of the group shortly after that date.</P>
    <P>The group has considered a variety of issues in the course of its deliberations to date, including the question of an increase in the period of maternity leave.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems has, to date, received in excess of 40 applications &ndash; including ones from Mullingar and Athlone &ndash; for CCTV systems, as aids to policing. The applications from Mullingar and Athlone are currently under consideration &ndash; as indeed are applications from other cities-towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects while the demand from <Col N="1265" /> various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have outlined before in the House the three essential components to the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime, which are a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime and a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that never in the history of the State has the Garda Síochána been better resourced or equipped and Garda strength is heading towards 12,000, an all time historic high. The Government is on target for increasing the capacity of the prison system by an unprecedented amount and its tough anti-crime policies are yielding the anticipated good results with a further fall of 5% in crime figures last year leading to a cumulative fall more than 20% since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>My policy for dealing with drugs and organised crime is well known: it is one of strong legislation backed up by tough enforcement to tackle drug dealing and trafficking. This policy has resulted in record drug seizures by the Garda Síochána, with many Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and major drug barons fleeing abroad with a high percentage of persons who are prosecuted being convicted and sentenced to prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to think, however, that I have just focused on the enforcement side of dealing with the crime problem. I am particularly pleased to have placed increased emphasis on measures to reduce youth crime and my Department has invested significantly in preventive measures such as the Garda youth diversion projects. There were just 12 in existence when I took up office. There are now 39, and I intend to further expand the programme in the future <Col N="1266" /> under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Finally, the estimates published by the Government for the year 2000 show that for the first time ever, spending in the justice area, will exceed £1 billion. As the Deputy will appreciate this level of investment is unprecedented and will pay dividends in the years to come in the fight against crime.</P>

This was within my Department's normal processing time for an application of this type. However, I understand that as a result of communication difficulties between the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin and the Irish Consulate in Istanbul, there may have been some delay in forwarding the application to my Department.</P>

      <P>The position generally is that eligibility for school transport is determined by reference to age and distance from the nearest suitable school. To be eligible for free transport, children under ten years of age must live at least two miles from, and be attending their nearest national school, while older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
      <P>Where a child is attending a school other than the nearest, it is necessary to obtain the written agreement of the board of management of the nearest school to the provision of fare-paying transport. By seeking the written agreement of the nearest school before allowing this concession, there can be no question of my Department facilitating a change in enrolment patterns or encouraging children to leave their appropriate nearest school. No application is considered without this agreement.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the nearest school in this instance has not consented to give a written agreement to the provision of transport, as it is entitled to do.</P>

      <P>Under the student support schemes, means-tested maintenance grants are payable at <Col N="1271" /> either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant, currently £710, is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant, currently £1,775, is payable in all other cases.</P>

    <P>There is no special &lsquo;away from home' allowance payable by my Department to students who do not qualify for a maintenance grant. However, apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, under which my Depart<Col N="1272" /> ment meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have recently increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
