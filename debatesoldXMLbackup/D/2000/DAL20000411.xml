    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replies to previous questions over the past two years or so on the possibility of convening further meetings of the forum, I indicated that, while this is a matter for the chairperson of the forum and the parties participating in it, the Government would be open to one or more such meetings if this seemed likely to advance progress <Col N="1206" /> in the political and peace processes and if support for this course of action was the predominant tendency among the participants in the forum. I also indicated that, since the last meeting of the forum on 5 December 1997, the predominant tendency on the part of the forum participants was to concentrate their time and energy on, first, the negotiation and, subsequently, the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. As I indicated in my reply to questions previously, the latter remains the focus of the Government's policy and efforts. In that context, I envisage there will be further round table meetings of the pro-Agreement parties, such as took place earlier in the current process of intensive consultations. I have arranged with the chairperson of the forum for soundings with parties participating in the forum, as to their views on an early meeting. The strongly preponderant view is that it would not be opportune to hold a meeting at this time.</P>
    <P>If there were to be a change of opinion in favour of such meetings, this could provide a context in which consideration could be given, perhaps by the co-ordinating committee of the forum, to finalising outstanding reports of the forum. The draft reports involved were comments of the forum on two consultancy reports which were published in 1995 and a draft report of the forum's sub-committee on obstacles in the South to reconciliation. It may be doubtful as to what would be the value now of finalising comments on studies published almost five years ago.</P>
    <P>The draft report of the obstacles sub-committee is in a different category, as it represented the primary follow-up on the undertaking given by my predecessor, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993. However, while the preparation of the sub-committee's report was well advanced at the time, early in 1996, when forum meetings were deferred, a great deal of water has flowed under the bridge in the meantime in regard to the matters dealt with in the draft report. Thus, if the broad issue were to be taken up again, it might not be a matter of finalising a report but rather of a very substantial reconsideration of the issues and extensive redrafting of the report.</P>
    <P>There have also been calls, in the context of current efforts to overcome obstacles to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to take forward establishment of the civic forum in Northern Ireland and the possible independent North-South consultative forum, as envisaged in the agreement. The relevant provisions of the latter involve roles for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland and for the Northern Ireland Administration. However, if it were felt to be helpful in the absence of other institutions, the Government would be open to proceed with some form of civic consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>In previous replies to the House, I have said that in the context of implementation of the agreement proceeding successfully, the Govern<Col N="1207" /> ment would envisage that the role played by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would be discharged by the joint parliamentary forum and North-South consultative forum, envisaged in paragraphs 18 and 19 of strand two of the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I welcome you back to the House after your recent bereavement.</P>
      <P>Was the Fianna Fáil Party one of the parties that indicated to the chairperson of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation that it was against reconvening the forum? My understanding is that the Labour Party and other parties were very much in favour of the forum being reconvened. If it is a question that the Fianna Fáil Party was against reconvening the forum, could the Taoiseach indicate why?</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach rightly said, the work of the obstacles sub-committee is now five years old. Does he believe that now, more than ever, there is a need for that document to be completed and, of necessity, updated as well?</P>
      <P>In respect of both questions, first, is the Fianna Fáil Party, as a political party, in favour of reconvening the forum? I am not referring to the Taoiseach as the head of Government, because this is an inter-party matter. Second, does the Taoiseach think that, in light of the difficulties that are currently ongoing in Northern Ireland, there is now a more pressing need than before to have the obstacles sub-committee rewrite or add to the draft report which it had virtually completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party's view, if I can answer for the Fianna Fáil Party, is that it would go along with whatever was the general view of other parties, and particularly&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, maybe I did not put the question very well. I did not ask the Taoiseach if he would go along with the point of view of other parties. Was his own party in favour of or against reconvening the forum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the question in another way. The Fianna Fáil view is to listen to what other parties have to say, particularly parties in Northern Ireland. If they had said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, Fianna Fáil would have been quite happy to go along with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the Taoiseach know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the parties were checked. Fianna Fáil has had a number of meetings with the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply suggests that the decision to reconvene the forum is a matter for the chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1208" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he indicating that he conveyed to the chairperson the views of other parties or the view of the Fianna Fáil Party? Or did the Fianna Fáil Party itself have a view, independently of what other parties' views might be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn seems to be a bit excited about the answer. Fianna Fáil continually, as a party, meets the parties in the North. It has had a number of such meetings recently and this issue has come up several times. It is the view of the parties in the North and a number of parties in the South too that there would no purpose in having the forum meet at this stage. If the parties in the North were to change that view, parties here, particularly the Fianna Fáil Party, would be very happy to change its view. We are relaxed on whether the forum meets or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the Fianna Fáil Party does not have a view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view is that we would like to go along with what would be best for the parties in the North&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>From behind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;who take the pressures. That is our point. It is not the Fianna Fáil view that we should force the chairperson in any way to call a meeting with the parties in the North who do not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue a different aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Fianna Fáil Party does not have a view of its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not responsible to the Dáil for the actions or statements of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of revelations from other places, he is very lucky. My second question to the Taoiseach concerns the obstacles sub-committee and the report it was likely to complete if the forum was to be reconvened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, that report is in a different category from the others. It came out of section 6 of the Joint Declaration of 15 December and was intended to try to take account of recognitions of the fears of the Unionist community. As a token of willingness to make a personal contribution to building up that necessary trust, the Taoiseach will examine with his colleagues any elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish State that can be represented to the Irish Government and of course political dialogue. That work was to try to deal with those kinds of obstacles. There is some merit in that because it is important in the long-term anyway. The report was done in draft terms. We should <Col N="1209" /> continue to look at that but we cannot do it without the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>But did the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not allowed to answer that during Question Time. Deputy Quinn asked that the chairperson be asked repeatedly to consult with the parties. Through the secretariat that was done. I had no discussions with the chairperson myself but the secretariat tell me that they checked with all the parties. There were a few parties who thought that the forum should be reconvened but the majority did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will explore that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach if the British and Irish Governments have yet agreed on a common approach on what is to be done now following the suspension of the Executive and the institutions with a view to finding a basis urgently to have them put back in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is covered in the later questions. This was just on the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter concerns the vacuum which is referred to with regard to the possibility of establishing a civic forum. The civic forum is not to be established at this stage because the Taoiseach has said that there is a First Minister and no Deputy First Minister in place. Arising from that lacuna in the arrangements, I put my question. Deputy Quinn's questions about the forum are tabled because there is a political vacuum arising from the absence of an Executive, about which I am asking.</P>
      <P>My question is in order, the Ceann Comhairle allowed me to put it and the Taoiseach should answer. I will put it again. Have the Irish and British Governments yet reached an agreed common joint Government decision on what should be done now in the wake of the suspension of the Executive to have the institutions restarted? Second, does the Taoiseach agree that this is now a matter of the gravest urgency in view of the organised spate of punishment beatings and shootings which are designed by paramilitaries to send, in the most macabre form possible through the severed limbs of individuals, a signal that they are unhappy and restless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish and British Governments continue to try to find a joint way forward. We have had a number of meetings at official level and a number of contacts at political level which we are continuing today and tomorrow. We hope by the weekend to have finalised our joint position, not that there is any particular difficulty with any point. Needless to say, there are a number of outstanding issues in the Good Friday Agreement, though it should be easy to come to a common position on most of them, but then there are the ones that continually create difficulties, which are well known. We must try to find <Col N="1210" /> a way we can usefully put that and win the support of other pro-Agreement parties to overcome the obstacles and resurrect the institutions in order to get on with politics. I do not think we are at a stage yet where we have that formula and we know that from our knowledge of the stated positions of parties in the discussions we have had with them at round table level and bilaterally over the past two or three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of their deliberations, which the Taoiseach hopes will conclude by this weekend, will the two Governments publish any statement of their joint understanding of the best way forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think we will. We will endeavour to have an agreed position between the two Governments and I am determined that we will do that. We will then consult all the other parties on their views and see if we can win support for that position. That is a difficult task, particularly at this time when there are strongly held views within those parties. We may agree on a position, but publishing that without consultation with the parties would probably prove very unhelpful, rather than helpful, to the process. Ultimately, if this gets anywhere, our proposals would probably see the light of day, but not in the shorter-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the non-publication of the position they hope to agree, will the two Governments put this position in writing between themselves so that there will be a written document in existence? Even if it is not publicly known it could state in unambiguous terms what the two Governments have agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases of the multi-party talks, the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement, the implementation bodies and the North-South bodies, all these matters were in writing. Of course, that does not stop people from having different interpretations later of what was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that part of the lesson of previous negotiations is that if a piece of paper with all the material is not available to all participants, the absence of such a document facilitates misinterpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that in the spirit in which Deputy Bruton says it. Of course it is, if he accepts that even in the case of having such a document, as in the Good Friday Agreement, that does not stop the interpretation from being entirely different. However, I agree it should be written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the concerns of many people who voted overwhelmingly for the Good Friday Agreement that in the period of eight weeks since the suspension of the institutions in February the two Governments <Col N="1211" /> have not appeared capable of agreeing a joint document, as the Taoiseach said? The other parties which were party to the Good Friday Agreement, which negotiated substantially in public and reported in public, have been marginalised to the point that no multi-party talks are being convened, North or South, on any agenda put forward by the two Governments. Does the Taoiseach share my concerns and those of many citizens of both states on this island that it behoves both Governments to put the process of negotiation and conciliation back on public track without delay? Will the Taoiseach explain why, following a lapse of eight weeks, no joint position has been agreed between the two Governments? How does he expect cross-party support from this side of the House if the doors of consultation are slammed shut?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be disappointed if that was Deputy Quinn's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach how does he expect cross-party support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not only referring to the last question. After the suspension of the institutions, the parties had no will to engage in bilateral or multilateral talks. A strong position was taken by both sides and many parties on the status of the suspension in discussions with both Governments. The talks which ultimately led to the Good Friday Agreement, after the conclusion of the strands talks, were not in the public domain. The conclusions and final discussions two years ago were not in the public domain then or at any other time. This was not the way the parties wanted to do business.</P>
      <P>I hope the Irish and British Governments would have no difficulty finalising a joint approach. However, we are conscious that we should be not only doing this but trying to carry all the pro-Agreement parties with us. We must focus on their concerns as best we can. Whatever we agree, we must try to pitch a compromise which will carry all the parties with us. We could draft a document that would satisfy both Governments, but depending on which way it was worded, we would know which party would not participate. That is not what we are engaged in. It is not just a question of putting the views of both Governments down on paper. I have many solutions to this problem, but unfortunately neither party is in agreement at any given time. I think the British Prime Minister is in exactly the same position, as are the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and Secretary of State Mandelson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past three or four weeks we have been endeavouring to see how far all parties can stretch their constituencies and use their initiative to find a compromise that will resolve the difficulties which have bedevilled the process for <Col N="1212" /> some time and enable us to bring forward a paper which would win the support of the pro-Agreement parties. That is difficult to do. I ask Deputy Quinn to support this process and not any other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a small part of the current problem is the perception among many of the parties that the two Governments are not on the same road, derived from briefings on behalf of the Irish Government against the recent decisions of the Secretary of State which resulted in some retaliation? That is now in the past and nothing can be done about it. However, does the Taoiseach agree that the two Governments must not only adopt a joint position but that in order to provide stability in a difficult situation, they must be seen to adopt an explicit joint position so there is none of the fracturing which tends to occur if they are not perceived to be on the same road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Taoiseach's previous reply that while the two Governments are capable of arriving at a joint position, they are reluctant to do so until bilateral negotiations are held with some of the other parties. Is a joint position representing no more than four parties, including both Governments and two other parties at loggerheads, being negotiated before an internal joint position is presented to the other parties? Is that a fair and accurate interpretation of the Taoiseach's answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fair or accurate interpretation. In the past ten days I have met the following parties. &ndash; the UUP, the SDLP whom I will meet again tomorrow and whom I have met several times and the Alliance Party. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has met the Alliance Party. I met the PUP and I met the Women's Coalition. Therefore, all of the parties are as up to date as I am. Sometimes they are more up to date because they meet each other more regularly than we meet them. There is a good relationship. They exchange information on each other's positions. They do not agree, but they exchange information. Therefore, there is not anybody being left out. The only one who I have not formally met in the past ten days is Mr. Gary McMichael of the UDP, who we like to keep posted on what is happening. The UDP, although not represented in the Assembly, is still a member of the pro-Agreement parties. We will continue to make sure it is kept posted.</P>
      <P>I would like to feel that we had a document which was all but finished. I hope to achieve that by the weekend, but it is not at that stage yet. There will be further meetings tomorrow with the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Bruton's question, the Government was extremely restrained regarding the issues of 11 February and I continue to be so. In so far as there was briefing, any briefing we would have done would have been mild compared with that <Col N="1213" /> of the Secretary of State, but that is his right &ndash; I have no difficulty with him.</P>

      <P>I do not want to use that word, but it was not in line. Deputy Bruton would be right if he criticised me if I did not make my strong views clear to both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. However, I did so and just a few days later I went to London to do it, where I said it straight to the two gentlemen. That was the fair thing to do.</P>
      <P>Since then, I have not engaged in any actions on this issue because that would be futile. As far as I am concerned, the Secretary of State Mr. Mandelson is there and is doing his best in a difficult situation. I have no difficulty working and getting on with him. As far as I am concerned, I just want to find a resolution and so does he. Whatever happened between 11 and 14 or so of February, it happened, end of story. It has been that way since and it will remain so.</P>
      <P>However, Deputy Bruton is quite correct. It is vitally important that the positions of the Irish and British Governments remain as close as possible. It is not always possible because of the nuances, but they should remain as close as possible. I will do my utmost to achieve that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government appear to be so surprised and angry at the decision to make the suspension in view of the fact that this had been signalled in legislation which had been passed in Westminster a full week previously? How come the Government was not active at that stage rather than afterwards in expressing anger after the event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach considered the issue of what would have happened in terms of the difficulties of reinstatement if the resignations had gone ahead, as the Taoiseach would have apparently preferred, rather than the suspension? Is it not the case that if resignation had occurred, there would have had to have been an affirmative vote of the Assembly to reinstate Mr. Séamus Mallon and Mr. David Trimble, they were at least two members shy on the Unionist side and, therefore, the reinstatement could not have occurred? Is it not the case in contrast that however unpalatable it was that in the case of suspension there was no need for an affirmative vote of the Assembly to reinstate the Executive, and this could be done by executive <i>fiat</i>; and that that choice was taken to avoid a vote which would not have been carried to allow the option of reinstating the Executive? Where is that analysis incorrect? If the Taoiseach cannot tell me where it is incorrect, can he <Col N="1214" /> explain to me how the Government came to be angry about what was, it would appear, an unpalatable inevitability?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton ended his last contribution by saying the issues of 11 February should be left in the past and that we should not go on about them. He then proceeded to ask me a long question about those events. I do not want to be argumentative in any way about this, either inside or outside the House. Deputy Bruton asked a fair question. I made the position known to the British Government. I went as far as explaining the position and giving it a fair briefing of what the Attorney General's advice was in advance of meeting Mr. Trimble, at its suggestion although I was going to meet him anyway, to explain to him precisely what the advice was and of arranging for his adviser to meet the Attorney General prior to the events so he would be aware of this and other issues which it would not be helpful to discuss now.</P>
      <P>I went to enormous lengths in this regard. For that reason we kept pressing Sinn Féin to give an updated position which I knew was on the way, but which was very slow in coming. I do not want to go back on events in this regard, but it is known that we spent 11 days trying to get this updated position. We tried to explain to Sinn Féin that it was important a second de Chastelain report was presented, and Members know the story of how this was delivered in the middle of the night and how it changed the position. During those days the position of the Government was that a review without a suspension was possible and that was almost achieved, although that is now history and there is no point in talking about it. That was our preferred position and a real option which could have been pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

In our view and in the view of many others, the institutions could have continued to operate while the issue and the second paper were further explored. That did not happen, it is water under the bridge and I am not arguing about it. However, it could have happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that we do not want to revisit the history of the events of 11 February? However, the interpretation of those events, understandably and in a very real sense, affects the near future. I want clarification from the Taoiseach in respect to the assertion repeatedly made by the president of Sinn Féin on behalf of that party and the republican movement <Col N="1215" /> that the actions taken by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, to suspend the institutions rather than face the possibility of the resignation, which was the clear alternative, were illegal. Will the Taoiseach say the action taken by Mr. Mandelson was not illegal? We need clarity on this, and I know the Taoiseach hates clarity. A major party in the peace process is stating that one bona fide party, one of the two Governments, engaged in an illegal act and we need to know the view of the other Government in this regard. In the view of the Taoiseach was the act illegal?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer questions the way I want to and the Deputy will not pick a way to say things and tell me I have to say yes or no. The Deputy has endeavoured to do that a number of times today, but I will not do so. We had a constitutional position which I explained and previously put on the record of the House. We explained it to the British Government, Mr. Trimble and others. I know other constitutional lawyers circulated their views to Deputy Bruton and others, and they can have their own interpretations. It creates a constitutional difficulty. In the British view it was quite legal because they do not have a written constitution, and an Act of Parliament supersedes whatever is in place on the day. From their point of view, therefore, what they did was quite legal but it created a difficulty for us. This is Ireland, not Britain, and we have a Constitution&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because his position relates to whatever Act supersedes it but he was party to an agreement with us and the North-South bodies and other institutions were set up with us. The Irish Government's view, therefore, should have been taken into account but it was not and that was the argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside because it is unresolvable, does the Taoiseach agree that there were political <Col N="1216" /> realities in terms of reinstatement which would not have been facilitated by resignation and that an alternative to resignation was desirable, given that the paper containing the resignations was in the hands of one individual who was about to meet Lord Alderdice in order to hand it over to him, if he is to be believed &ndash; I believe he is to be believed having met the gentleman in question &ndash; and that created a situation which was very difficult in practical terms?</P>
    <P>Would it be helpful to the process at this stage if the Taoiseach would at least express in the House comprehension of the decision that was taken so that we can ask the British in turn to express comprehension of the Irish Government's difficulties with that decision in order that we can move on and put behind us the mischievous briefing of one Irish newspaper by one official, apparently acting on behalf of the Government?</P>

It is long since off the agenda although other people have gone on about what did or did not happen in regard to the suspension. Resignation would have been entirely unhelpful but that is why the review mechanism has kept things going. It could have worked and I do not blame anyone for that because more than one person was needed to help it. Unfortunately, on the day through a series of meetings it did not fall right, but I will not go into that now.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The private donation of £50 million from Mr. J. P. McManus towards the financing and development of Campus and Stadium Ireland has been given effect by way of a letter of assignation between Pictet &amp; Cie, Geneva &ndash; the &ldquo;Bank&rdquo;&ndash; and the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash;&ldquo;Beneficiary&rdquo;. This represents the full extent of the agreement. No other condition or consideration arises.</P>
      <P>The document was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 February 2000.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to place on record the Government's appreciation of Mr. McManus's most generous donation.</P>
      <P>I met a senior delegation of the FAI on 6 March. In attendance were Pat Quigley, President, Michael Hyland, Chairman, National League, Brendan Menton, Hon. Treasurer and Bernard O'Byrne, Chief Executive.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to convey my view to the delegation that I would like to see them come on board with the Stadium Ireland project and my reasons for that view. I explained that the design for Stadium Ireland is for 80,000 seats built to the highest international standards. This would include 8,200 premium seats, 96 corporate boxes, each with 12 seats, four party suites accommodating 100 and a VIP box with a capacity of 200. This configuration could be changed during the design phase to suit requirements.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that if the FAI were to avail of the Stadium Ireland facility, it would be in a position to receive the revenue from the sale of the seats and the boxes in the stadium, guaranteeing an immediate significant income stream without any risk on the part of the FAI. The FAI would be free to transfer any contractual arrangements it had entered into for Eircom Park in respect of the sale of corporate boxes and seats to Stadium Ireland. A conservative estimate of this revenue would be in the region of £40 million. In addition, the FAI would not be faced with any capital debt repayments or infrastructural costs.</P>
      <P>I also discussed the potential planning difficulties faced by the FAI in relation to their Eircom Park proposal. Deputies will have seen the public statement issued by the Department of Defence after its recent meeting with the FAI. While this is a matter for the planning authorities in the final analysis, the difficulties facing the FAI cannot be underestimated and I considered that it was important to explain that to the delegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in Stadium Ireland would allow the FAI to invest some £40 million to meet its stated aim of developing the game of soccer at local and community level while having a state-of-the-art facility for international games. In addition, the FAI would have available to it the funds which the Government is prepared to make <Col N="1219" /> available in line with our commitment to the development of sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The FAI stated in response, that it intended to proceed with its project but would avail of Stadium Ireland when Eircom Park did not meet its capacity requirements. I have no information on whether that position has changed on foot of its meeting with the Department of Defence. I accept that the development of Eircom Park is a matter for the FAI in the final analysis and I respect its wishes in that regard even though I consider that my proposal is the one that makes sports and business sense.</P>
    <P>The Government is now pressing ahead with the development of Campus and Stadium Ireland. The board of the development company had its first meeting on Wednesday, 29 March and the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation attended with me. We asked the board to press ahead with its work with all reasonable speed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked if any other benefit was conferred and the answer is no. A question was raised as to whether the State Property Act should cover this issue. If it was property, it might come under the 1977 Act, a measure introduced for an individual who in 1977 gave a gift of a heritage type property to the State, which enabled them to visit the property and involve themselves in the activity of the property. I am not sure which property was involved but I am sure it had merit like many of these donations. That Act does not apply in this case. Mr. J. P. McManus has given the gift and he has no further involvement. He has attached no conditions.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Allen's query, it was the Attorney General who, for the avoidance of doubt, put it under the State Property Act. Mr. McManus wanted to just give the money and let the Government deal with it in whatever way it wished. He did not want any conditions. He was wise in that regard because as soon as the Attorney General tried to tie it down, somebody looked at the Act and tried to raise something else. I know people are entitled to do that but Mr. McManus said he did not want anything. There are no conditions and no benefit. The Minister for Finance set out the position in a reply today to a question from Deputy Allen. I do not have time to read out that reply but Deputies should look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national children's strategy being developed by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is an example of one of a number of policy responses the Government is introducing to promote the welfare of children. The strategy will seek to build on the efforts of statutory, voluntary and community agencies in a renewed effort to develop more child-focused services.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency, in its recent submission to the national children's strategy, notes that much of the available comparative EU data on child poverty relates to the early to mid-1990s and recognises that the rate of child poverty here fell in the late 1990s. This is backed up by the latest data from the ESRI which shows reductions in both consistent poverty among children and the proportion of children living in poor households. The Government recognises, however, that much still needs to be done.</P>
      <P>The Government shares the view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or to improving wages.</P>
      <P>The recent 2000 budget provides for a record £106 million investment in child benefit. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third child and subsequent children. From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third child and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides an opportunity to progress a number of policies in relation to the needs of children. Under the terms of Framework III of the programme, new targets will be considered under the various themes of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the needs of children are kept to the fore in the design of policy, policy proposals across Departments are poverty proofed with particular attention paid to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. The unemployment rate is now well below the EU average and the live register has fallen by over 90,000 since the Government took office. Long-term unemployment has fallen more rapidly than the live register as a whole and employment opportunities have increased. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce. By increasing income from work, not just the individuals <Col N="1225" /> benefit but the families and communities in which they live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a sense of shame when reading out that justification? Does he accept that the Combat Poverty Agency, an agency under the aegis of his Department, has produced an independent report which confirms that the rate of child poverty in this country is one of the highest in the EU? Is he not ashamed that the agency reports that one quarter of Irish children, who number approximately one million, are poor? When trotting out the facts about the few extra pounds given in child benefit, does he share with me a sense that this is wrong? One need not be a left wing pinko to accept that it is wrong. Will the Minister agree that with such an enormous surplus in the Exchequer accounts it is wrong to allow child poverty to exist to this extent? Immediate steps should be taken to eliminate it. We have the means to do so, all that is lacking is the political will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The data upon which the report is based are for the early to mid-1990s, for most of which period the Deputy's party was in Government. I have said many times that the best way out of poverty, for both adults and children, is employment. Since the Government came to office two and a half years ago, more than 90,000 people have gone off the live register. At the same time the population has risen by a similar figure. This year the Government provided £106 million for child benefit, a record amount representing a 25% increase on the entire budget for child benefit last year.</P>
      <P>We will not solve child poverty with a wave of a magic wand, but all Deputies will accept the result of the economic policies started by my party in Government in 1987 and followed in the intervening years. I entered national politics in 1987 and I defy anybody to say that the incidence of poverty generally, especially child poverty, has not improved. Things have dramatically improved, especially the issue of inter-generational unemployment and poverty. As a public representative, Deputy O'Keeffe knows that families which looked forward to a future of poverty into the next generation now look at the possibility of their children working and getting out of the cycle of poverty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report prepared by the ESRI for the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which was made available last November. It covers the period from 1987-97 and, therefore, provides an informative, historical analysis for policymakers. As the report points out, in income terms the position of older people disimproved over the ten year period covered. This is why, on taking office, the Government set ambitious goals to secure the future of our older people.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of £100 by 2000. We are well on the way to achieving this, with record increases in pension rates over the last three budgets. In 1997 the maximum rate of old age contributory pension, at £78 per week, equated to 28% of average industrial earnings. From next month, at £96 per week, it will equate to over 30%, which is working towards the 34% recommendation of the Pensions Board in its report Securing Retirement Income.</P>
      <P>In last year's review of the programme for Government, the Government went further and committed itself to the early achievement of the £100 commitment and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions by 2002. That includes non-contributory old age pensions. In addition, over the lifetime of this Government, all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have provided that from October this year entitlement to the free schemes will be extended to all people over 75 years of age regardless of household income or composition. In this regard, I am pleased to inform Deputies that the review of the free schemes is being published by the Policy Institute today and I will launch it later this evening. I have arranged that a copy of the review will be made available to Members of both <Col N="1227" /> Houses this afternoon. I will examine the review in detail in the context of future budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>The Government identified in An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and has decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for people age 70 and over should be doubled.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which were already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one third in 1999. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three-year period, began on 1 March 1999, the second stage of the process was implemented on 1 March this year and the third in March 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the National Anti-Poverty Strategy will be updated and the underlying methodology reviewed and revised where appropriate. In particular, new targets will be considered under the themes of older people, women's poverty, child poverty, health and housing-accommodation. This process will be completed during the first 18 months of the programme. In addition, the issue of relative income poverty will be reviewed by a working group to be established to examine bench-marking and indexation issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for circulating copies of the review of the free schemes. A quarter of elderly householders are living below the 50% poverty line while over half are living below the 60% poverty line. Will the Minister agree this shows that older people are becoming increasingly marginalised and that despite the increases which he has trumpeted over the past three years people have become increasingly reliant on very low incomes? Does he agree it is extraordinary that 82% of people living alone rely entirely on social welfare and that over 60% of all senior householders live on less than £100 per week?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that social welfare income for senior citizens is increasing at a much slower rate than income increases among the general population? Does he also agree there is a specific problem with regard to non-contributory old age pensions in that it will be many years before those reliant on them will get near the Minister's target of £100 per week? Does he agree there is a similar problem with widow's non-contributory pensions, that he should give deeper thought to the problems associated with poverty among the elderly and that merely to say that the Government is moving towards a target of £100 per week by 2002 is not good enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government did not need the ESRI, Combat Poverty Agency or anybody else to tell it about the difficulties experienced by older people over the years. Many times in this <Col N="1228" /> House I have said that my party believed that because older people did not have the same lobbying powers as other groups in the 1980s and 1990s they fell behind. That is why, when we took office in June 1997 we decided to positively discriminate in favour of older people. We have done that, perhaps to the detriment of other groups which might feel they have not been as well looked after.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report referred to the free schemes, high levels of ownership and wide medical card coverage, issues which we addressed in our recent programmes. Taking account of these factors, the conclusion is drawn that older people in general have higher living standards than was anticipated and that cash incomes are less crucial as a means of alleviating elderly deprivation than is the case for other sectors.</P>
      <P>According to the NPPI method of calculating old age pensions, that is the old age contributory pension as a percentage of previous years average industrial earnings, it will be 30.41% this year. Last year it was 29.74% and 29% the previous year. In 1997 it was only 27.98%. When the rainbow coalition was in Government this dropped in its mid-term and then increased. Our record in office is, therefore, better. The Government wishes to take a two-pronged approach to the issue of older people. First, we want to address the issue of the State pension and, second, we want to ensure that there is good occupational pension coverage.</P>

      <Quest>if rent allowance is available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for separated fathers seeking to provide accommodation for their children where there are formal or informal joint custody arrangements; and if the separated father is precluded from this support where the special rent allowance is payable to the separated mother.</Quest>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent to eligible people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which rent supplement recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for a rent supplement can be made by contacting the CWO at a person's local health centre. Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the health board that <Col N="1229" /> they have a housing need they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the health board must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.</P>
    <P>Separated fathers are not precluded from obtaining rent supplement where they have custody or joint custody and they need to provide accommodation for their children. In a case where a separated couple have joint custody of a child, the requirements of both parents in respect of having adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is made. In these cases, documentation is required showing the joint custody arrangement before a decision could be made. The fact that the separated mother is in receipt of rent supplement would not in itself preclude the separated father from being entitled to assistance towards his rent. Each case is individually assessed on its merits, taking all matters of the case into account.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the old attitude was that the children would live with the deserted or deserting mother and the father would look after himself? Does he accept this attitude must change given that the case I highlighted involved informal joint custody? Does he accept the official attitude to that has not changed? The deserted father in the case I highlighted receives a net figure of £37 because he cannot get supplementary welfare to provide accommodation for his children who stay with him for half the week. Does he agree that in such circumstances attitudes must change and that we must accept and encourage joint parenting as the best option for children to continue to have access to both parents? Does he agree that, in a case such as I have described &ndash; I can give the Minister the details if he is interested &ndash; the father who has been deserted should not be precluded by order of the health board because a supplementary welfare allowance is paid to the deserting wife?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that circumstances in society are changing. The courts now award joint custody more often than they did. Obviously the social welfare system must take that into account. Rent supplement is not necessarily refused to a separated father in a joint custody case. Each case is determined on its merits. The Deputy previously referred to a case and I will not go into the detail. In that instance, the father received a rent supplement. It may not be the same case. If the Deputy has a case in mind, perhaps he would table a question about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case I refer to now, there was a rent supplement for a single person only. The result was that the father had to pay the balance of the rent from his unemployment assistance, giving him a net £37 a week. He was told by the health board that he was not con<Col N="1230" /> sidered to be in need of accommodation for his children as they were already adequately accommodated in his wife's house nearby. Does the Minister accept that, as the children are accommodated for half the week in the deserted or deserting wife's house, the husband should not be precluded and that the attitude must change not just at political but also at bureaucratic and official level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Attitudes have changed. Either person in a couple is not precluded from receiving rent supplement to the level required to care for children. However, the Deputy must accept that, in a joint custody case, the child will stay with one parent for perhaps three days a week and with the other for four days a week. It is up to the community welfare officer in each area to decide on these cases and I have encountered cases in my constituency where the CWO must make a decision based on each case. Perhaps the Deputy could bring the case to which he refers to my attention. It may be the same case in Clonakilty which he cited previously, and that was a decision made independently of me by the CWO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the appeals office decided that he could not receive supplementary welfare to enable him to have a room for his children because the health board was already paying an allowance in respect of their accommodation with their mother. That is the decision of the appeals office. Does the Minister accept that type of approach is wrong, that we must change it and that we must ensure change percolates through the system for which the Minister is now responsible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy published in 1997 recognised that disadvantage and unemployment affect virtually every area in Ireland and that the poor and the unemployed are not singularly clustered in major urban areas. However, particular communities suffer from cumulative disadvantage and, for such <Col N="1231" /> people, it is likely that the cumulative effect is to intensify their experience of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that, in consultation with the relevant actors, the national anti-poverty strategy will be updated, the underlying methodology reviewed, the existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate and possible new targets will be considered. Disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty will be two of the theme areas to be examined as part of this review.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of the Environment and Local Government are working with local authorities to raise their awareness of the NAPS and to assist them in advising on the development of anti-poverty strategies in the context of the local government reform process.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the NAPS initiative in local authorities is also provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I see this expansion to the wider public service as one of the key challenges in the next phase of the strategy and one which can play a significant role in addressing the spatial concentration of poverty in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The community development support programmes which operate under my Department focus on investment in capacity building so that socially excluded groups and local communities, working alongside the other social partners, can be active participants in identifying and meeting their own development needs. In assessing priorities for the expansion of these support programmes, we have regard, among other things, to the comparative disadvantage of those areas being assessed. The anti-poverty focus of the project and the involvement of local people drawn from groups which themselves experience poverty and social exclusion are also important considerations. In addition, the establishment of new projects in rural areas has been identified as a priority. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness there is a commitment that the number of projects will continue to be expanded in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a wide range of research to be carried out in a number of key areas, including poverty, health, education and training. It is expected that this research will help to inform the targeting of funding at areas of high deprivation.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that repeatedly over the past three years the Government has shown it could not be bothered about the plight of the 500,000 people at least who have been left behind by the Celtic tiger? Has the Minister not carried out sufficient research in this area in the past three years? I cite particularly the work of the Dublin Employment Pact and PJ Drudy in the Dublin area which showed conclusively that 11 of the 12 most disadvantaged areas are in Dublin. Is it not essential that the Minister works with <Col N="1232" /> the Combat Poverty Agency on a spatial basis to devise a series of indices and responses for areas, districts and parishes? One such area in my constituency has 45% unemployment. The Minister has presided over that. What does he propose to do about it? His track record in the past three years shows little evidence of a serious response.</P>

      <P>Regarding areas of deprivation, 90 community development projects have been put in place and these were originally instituted by a Fianna Fáil Government. These are under the aegis of my Department and are already <i>in situ </i>in areas of disadvantage, especially in urban areas. A further 40 are being added, a number of which have been identified in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Regarding the 25 areas of disadvantage to be identified as a result of the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an interdepartmental committee will meet shortly and will take into account the various views and experiences of a long list of groups, including the territorial employment pacts, the Combat Poverty Agency, the community development projects, the national drugs strategy and various initiatives, such as the URBAN initiative, the integrated social services project and the local development framework. The list is endless but all the experiences of the various initiatives which have been put in place by successive Governments in the past number of years, especially to address urban deprivation, will be taken into account. It is hoped recommendations will be made by this interdepartmental committee to the Government by the end of this year, which will enable 25 areas to be designated with a prioritised list of measures that can be implemented within a three year timeframe. Our history will stand up to scrutiny, as opposed to when the Deputy's party was on this side of the House.</P>

      <Quest>the numbers availing of the student summer jobs scheme in each of the past three years; the way in which these figures compare with the number of positions available on those schemes, having regard to the shortfall of students who qualify for those jobs; and if he will extend the criteria to include students who have just completed the leaving certificate.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the students summer jobs scheme since its inception in 1993 has been to provide financial help to less well-off third level students who do not have access to unemployment payments during the summer. The scheme allows students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. Local groups with projects in their communities can register with the Department as sponsors. The main focus of the scheme is on providing the students concerned with an income and not necessarily to fill all the jobs offered by sponsors.</P>
      <P>A total of 15,600 students availed of the scheme in 1997, 13,600 in 1998 and 9,299 in 1999. The number of projects made available by sponsors for each of those three years was 30,189, 31,552 and 23,473, respectively.</P>
      <P>While the level of projects offered has remained high over recent years, there has been a significant decline in the number of students taking part. This is due to the wider availability of summer jobs, which is a very welcome development and has diminished the necessity for the scheme as a means of financial support to needy students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The target group for the scheme is third level students. I do not intend to extend this to students at second level. There would be significant cost implications in such a move and these could only be considered in a budgetary context. Furthermore, bearing in mind the purpose of the scheme, there is no justification for extending it in a situation where the number of job opportunities is increasing and employers are finding it difficult to fill them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that only 9,000 of the 23,000 positions available last year were filled, which means that only 40% of the jobs were taken up. Does he agree that many students would be delighted to take those jobs but do not qualify because of the means test? Many others who have just completed their leaving certificate are waiting for their results and are not sure what they will do, but most of those who go to third level colleges could provide worthwhile help to their communities by taking those jobs. Does the Minister agree it would be worthwhile to extend the scheme to those students? That would have a twofold effect. It would provide job opportunities for those leaving certificate students and would mean, as the Minister said, that very valuable work would be done in the community.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that a 1998 ESRI report shows that 47% of those who left the second level system in the 1996-97 academic year were in employment 12 months after leaving school. There has been a continued fall over recent years in the percentage of school leavers who are unemployed. The reality is that young people are getting jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme provides summer jobs for students. According to the labour force survey, in 1997, when this Government took office, 22% of people aged between 15 and 19 years were unemployed. That figure is now 9%. In 1997, 14% of people aged between 20 and 24 years were unemployed. That figure is now 7%. The reality is that, whether we or people outside the House like it, students are voting with their feet. There are much more lucrative jobs available in the economy, where employers are begging people to take jobs, particularly in the tourism industry during the summer. The student summer jobs scheme was designed at a time of high unemployment, when students could not get summer jobs. The situation has now completely changed. The <Col N="1235" /> decrease in the number of students availing of this scheme is due mainly to the buoyant economy.</P>

      <P>As three of these questions are for oral answer, time not exceeding 18 minutes will be available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 55, 65, 74 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was published in October 1998. Arising from this review, I introduced major improvements to the carer's allowance scheme in the 1999 and 2000 budgets.</P>
      <P>At the end of March 2000, there were 14,981 carer's allowances in payment. This represents an increase of over 60% in the number of carers claiming the allowance since this Government took office. Expenditure on carer's allowance was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase over the three years since I became Minister of 115%.</P>
      <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities is to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development by the State, in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, one of the remaining proposals arising from the review of the carer's allowance will be examined this year. A consultancy study will be undertaken to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partner<Col N="1237" /> ship approaches, and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard. In budget 2000, I announced the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme which recognises that leaving employment to provide care is a contingency broadly similar to other contingencies under the social insurance code and, as such, the benefit will fill a gap in the social insurance system. The new carer's benefit scheme, which will be of 15 months' duration, is specifically intended to support people who must leave the work force to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>The scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. The carer's benefit scheme will come into effect from October this year. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, is currently drawing up legislation on the employment rights of carer's benefit recipients.</P>
    <P>In budget 2000 I also extended the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes to all carers in receipt of a carer's allowance, and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. These extensions ensure that carers will qualify for all free schemes from October. In addition, I have made provision for an increase in the amount of the annual respite care grant for qualified carers from £200 to £300.</P>
    <P>Another of the key priorities identified in the Government's review of its action programme is to establish a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care, to be operated by the health boards. This area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. However, I understand that the Western Health Board has agreed to undertake this pilot project in its area and that needs assessments will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of allowing widows to claim a widow's pension and carer's allowance concurrently from my Department, the review of the carer's allowance &ndash; which came out in October 1998 &ndash; noted that the carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment, and concluded that the practice of paying only one allowance should continue.</P>
    <P>The review noted that with very few exceptions, this is a fundamental feature of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which he is entitled. However, the review recommended the payment of a &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; pay<Col N="1238" /> ment to recognise all carers who were providing the highest levels of care. This would be a non-means tested payment available to all carers, including social welfare recipients, regardless of their income. In order to provide this payment, an assessment of the care levels being provided would be required. This proposal will be examined further when the pilot project on needs assessment has been completed.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally, will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme. </P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion about the last part of the Minister's answer concerning the carer's allowance for a carer who becomes a widow. I have been pursuing this matter for some time. If a carer qualifying for the carer's allowance because her husband's income is less than £150 per week, and caring for a doubly incontinent bed-ridden patient, unfortunately becomes a widow she then has to suffer the loss of her husband along with his £150 weekly income. She then qualifies for a widow's pension which is about £70.23 but she will lose the carer's allowance despite the fact that she continues to care for the husband's doubly incontinent relative in her house, who is bedridden 365 days a year. Should that person not be entitled to the carer's allowance as well as the widow's pension? Could we not have some regulation that would allow that to happen in the very few instances where carer's unfortunately become widows?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind we can have that examined. However, various lobby groups had an input into the October 1998 review of the carer's allowance which came up with the strong recommendation that there should not be two payments. This was because the social welfare system would not be recognised as a system for paying for care for people. The carer's allowance is designed to assist those who are on a low income. It is means tested and the question of whether or not we should abolish the means test is one of the issues about which Deputies are being lobbied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered either Question No. 53 or No. 55. In a recent response during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, the Minister said he was considering some sort of public private partnership context for funding pensions. He has already admitted today that one quarter of our senior citizens live in poverty. He has not disputed the ESRI report and he has admitted that the gap is growing. Ordinary income is growing at 3.5 times that of senior citizens. Is it not necessary, therefore, for the Minister to turn his attention urgently to the management of the social insurance fund and the reserve fund to see what he can do about this? A few weeks ago, the Minister made this comment in a throw-away remark but he has failed absolutely to answer it today.</P>
      <P>As regards Question No. 55, can the carer's benefit be introduced on time? It looks as if we will have a frantic rush, as we had with the Minimum Wage Bill, or it may not happen on time at all. It seems to be quite a complex matter to hold the jobs, particularly of women who would give up their jobs for 15 months to look after people.</P>

      <P>We are getting extremely complimentary remarks from all the social partners for bringing it in. The Deputy does a lot of talking about examining issues but we take action. The Deputy knows quite well what the reality is &ndash; that the carer's benefit can not come into being until the end of the year. That is because one cannot introduce carer's benefit without protecting the employment rights of those who will be benefiting from that allowance. The legislation has to be passed by the House.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that in that situation there are 35,000 who provide full-time care who get nothing? Why is he allowing that situation to continue? Second, why has the Minister not improved the means test? Does he accept that it is because of that means test and the fact that the Government has not improved it, that those 35,000 people are precluded from getting any payment? Third, does he really accept the hogwash and gobbledegook from his report that precludes the poorest section of our people from getting the carer's allowance? They are people such as the widow mentioned by Deputy McCormack and those in receipt of social welfare payments. Does he accept that it is absolutely ludicrous and socially wrong?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 35,000 the Deputy has referred to is an estimate of people in community care. He says they are getting nothing but the reality is that they are receiving support, primarily from the Department of Health and Children which is responsible for the issue of caring for the elderly in the community through the health boards.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance was started in 1990 by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, with an estimate at that time of £100,000. Ten years later, it has risen to just over £78 million. The vast majority of that increase has taken place when my party were in Government and not when the Deputy's party was in Government. The Deputy's party did nothing about the means <Col N="1241" /> test when it was in office. He is confusing the disregard with the means test.</P>

I would defy the Deputy or the Fine Gael Party to say that when they come back into Government, if they ever do, they will abolish the means test, because they know full well that if they were on this side of the House they would not. I have given an undertaking through the Chair. The Deputy referred to &ldquo;gobbledegook&rdquo; and is doing a great disservice to all those who took part in the review of the carer's allowance, which made many recommendations only in October 1998, 99% of which have been complied with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion last week to the effect that Ireland, in bringing in parental leave for employees having children born on or adopted after 3 June, has not fully complied with its obligations. The Department of Justice, Equality and <Col N="1245" /> Law Reform is examining that opinion with a view to identifying the measures required to be put in place to give effect to the opinion and is in consultation with the Attorney General's office in this regard.</P>
      <P>It could mean legislation. The position is we have responded expeditiously to the Commission's notice and welcomed the clarification in the opinion and we intend to respond as quickly as possible on the issue. The date is 5 or 6 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been briefed in advance of the Order of Business on this legislative measure. Does he have any estimate of the timetable required? Can a short, amending Bill to deal with an issue of time rather than eligibility be introduced before the end of the session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>To be helpful, during the debate on the Bill Fine Gael and other parties tabled amendments to extend the eligibility period for parental leave. The Taoiseach could look at those and use them in a short Government Bill and we would be happy to co-operate in putting through an amending Bill such as that as quickly as possible. We are clearly in breach in a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Department has received the reasoned opinion and must respond to it. The Department must identify the measures needed to put the opinion into effect and is looking into that in consultation with the Attorney General. If, as seems likely, this requires change that will be done as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the overburdened legislative responsibilities of the Department in question, I ask the Taoiseach to refer this matter immediately to the relevant committee of the House. That committee can be empowered or requested to take the suggestions made by Deputy Owen, to bring in a short, amending Bill that could be initiated with the support of the Government. If we wait for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do so on top of its existing workload, we will not see it until next year. Let us be realistic about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department must respond and come to an agreement with the Commission by 3 June, so that is the first thing that must happen. It must satisfy the Commission and identify the measures needed. That must be done first and then perhaps quick amending legislation would work. The issue here relates to the date of 3 June 1996 in the Bill, which the Commission, from my reading of this brief, feels should be 3 June 1993. That is how it looks, but it needs to be examined further, though the Commission seems to focus only on this matter. If that is the case, quick, amending legislation could easily be introduced.</P>

      <P>We now move on to item 15, motion re Planning and Development Bill, 1999, to conclude within 30 minutes. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, to move the motion.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government has power to make amendments to the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, the purposes of which are&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)to amend and extend the law in relation to the tolling of public roads provided for in the Roads Act, 1993; and</P>
      <P>(ii)to amend the law in relation to the tenure of City and County Managers provided for in the Local Government Act, 1991,</P>
      <P>and to amend the long title of the Bill accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> I appreciate that this is a technical motion which is not designed to deal with the substance of the amendments proposed. Members will have a full opportunity to debate the amendments in detail when these are considered in due course. However, in order to place the proposed amendments in context, it is useful to outline briefly the purpose of the provisions to be inserted in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The aim of the amendments is to modify the existing legislative arrangements for tolling under the Roads Act, 1993, by removing the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's quasi-judicial functions in relation to toll schemes, associated by-laws etc. Under the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, the decision to adopt or revoke a toll scheme, adopt by-laws or enter into toll arrangements with private investors will be a matter for the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads and in the case of non-national roads, a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>As a corollary, the Roads Act, 1993, is also being amended so that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can issue policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities regarding the exercise of their functions regarding road tolling. The NRA or local authority will be obliged to comply with a directive issued by the Minister. Any policy directives made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisions in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which reduce the role of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in project-specific approvals and consents. In this connection, the amendments proposed to the tolling provisions of the Roads Act, 1993, remove an anomaly which would otherwise have been created under the Bill. This would have seen the Minister for the Environment and Local Government retaining an involvement in the approval of specific toll projects, while approval of associated motorway schemes, compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements in respect of the same road projects would be transferred to An Bord Pleanála. In the absence of these amendments, part of the project decision making process would be retained by the Minister and part by An Bord Pleanála, which would be clearly inappropriate. The proposed amendments seek to address this situation and are consistent with the other provisions of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The amendments are also in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity as regards decision making, while retaining ministerial control at a broad policy level, and will simplify statutory processes for the approval of toll schemes. The decision making process in respect of toll schemes will be devolved to the bodies best placed to do it; the NRA in the case of national roads and local authorities in the case of non-national roads. It would not be appropriate for powers regarding approval <Col N="1254" /> of tolling schemes, etc., to be transferred to An Bord Pleanála as such matters are outside its remit. It is important to note that the NRA and local authorities will not be operating in a vacuum on tolling; as indicated previously, they will be obliged to comply with policy directives issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in this regard. As at present, the NRA and local authorities would still be required to engage in an extensive consultative process before adopting a toll scheme, which includes a requirement to hold an oral hearing into any objections to a proposed toll scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to delivering on the national development plan and to streamline procedures as much as possible in order to facilitate the achievement of the plan's objectives within the timescale proposed. It is therefore important that the proposed changes to the tolling regime are implemented as soon as possible. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, is an appropriate mechanism to achieve this outcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also taking the opportunity to amend the law on the tenure of local authority city and county managers. At present the maximum term of a local authority city or county manager is seven years. As Members may be aware, the principle of fixed tenure contracts for local authority managers was established in the Local Government Act, 1991. The arrangements were generally on the same lines as for departmental Secretaries General and received general acceptance. However, unlike departmental Secretaries General who generally serve only one term, managers are entitled to apply for other manager posts and many of them do so.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons managers apply for other posts &ndash; preferred location or higher pay, for instance. However, the principal reason managers apply for other manager posts during their contract period is to ensure continued employment. To ensure they will have a new appointment before the present term expires, the trend is for managers to start looking for new posts after about four or five years' service. This has resulted in managers vacating their existing posts prematurely, giving rise to instability in local authority management. This is not in the best interests of efficient and effective local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister examined this problem and consulted the managers about it. He concluded that the fundamental problem is that the contract periods are currently too short. The required stability will be restored to the system by the extension of the contract periods as now proposed. In accordance with the amendment, the basic contract will continue to be for a maximum of seven years, as at present, but managers will have an option to extend this by three years.</P>
    <P>Primary legislation is required to make these changes in view of the need for certainty in relation to managers' tenure and to avoid any doubt attaching to the legality of the important executive functions exercised by managers, for <Col N="1255" /> example, in the area of planning. The Minister is anxious that the amendment to the tenure of office arrangements be implemented as soon as possible to restore stability to the system. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, provides the opportunity to meet this requirement and Members will have the opportunity to debate the substance of the amendments in full on Committee Stage. I therefore commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a simple technical matter. The Government has decided that there are two things which it would like to do and it has looked around for an appropriate framework in which to do them. There is no such framework in existence, but the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, is before the House and the Government thinks that, by extending the scope of that Bill and amending its long title, it can bring these two matters into its remit. That is why the Minister tabled this motion. These are two matters, which are unrelated to any Bill which is before the House, which the Government wants to introduce and therefore it is going to piggy-back them on a planning and development Bill which is before the House. That is not just a technical matter.</P>
      <P>However, the reason we are discussing this is even simpler than that. The Government wanted to take this motion without debate last week, and I looked at it and wondered why the Government wanted to give local authorities power to toll roads and to amend the law regarding county managers. I wanted to know why the Government wants to do these things before I agreed to let the Minister go ahead and do it. The answer I got was: &ldquo;We cannot discuss that with you; this is just a technical matter&rdquo;, and I do not accept that. If the Government wants to make a substantial change in a Bill before the House, then it must explain why it wants to make that substantial change or, as in this case, those two substantial changes.</P>
      <P>There have been several instances in the recent past where the Government has introduced Bills, to which, in the course of their discussion by this House, major changes have been made. This is one and the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, is another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bound to say that I smelled a rat last week when this request to take this matter without debate was made. Now that the Minister has explained what it is all about, I find it even more suspicious. Is there anything more ridiculous than saying, as is set out in the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, that it is proposed to divest powers, to give away powers of the Minister? In order to do that, the Government follows a procedure which appears to give powers to two other bodies, but they will exercise those powers only under the direction of the Minister. It is proposed to tell county councils that they may charge people for using county roads. In order to do so, they will be given the <Col N="1256" /> power to fix charges, but they can be directed as to what to do by the Minister. I do not know what is the sense of that. They are being given power to do something which the Minister can tell them to do, something which the Minister can do already, if he so wishes. I cannot see the sense of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister pretends that these &ldquo;amendments are in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity as regards decision making, while retaining ministerial control at a broad policy level&rdquo;. I wish the Government would make up its mind what it wants to do. Does it want the Minister or somebody else to control things? It is trying to have it both ways here.</P>
    <P>I do not object to what the Government is proposing to put before us regarding the county managers. There is a fair case to be made in that regard, but it is not obvious from the motion. Before we decide to interfere substantially in the terms of a Bill before this House, we should be given the courtesy of being told broadly what the Government wants to do and why. That is what we have done here this afternoon and I am glad that the point has been made.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose this motion. However, I will have a great deal to say on the amendments, which will flow from this and which we will debate on Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The first is as confused a proposal as I have ever seen emanate from the Government, and I feel sorry for the Minister of State that he has to come to the House to try to make sense of it as it makes no sense. Now at least we have established that it is legitimate for the House to be asked by the Government to tell us why it wants to do things in this manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is introducing two new provisions to extend the Planning and Development Bill, which is currently being considered by a committee of the House, almost as an afterthought. One of those provisions relates to the terms of office of city and county managers. I have no difficulty with the proposal to extend from seven to ten years the maximum period of the term of office of managers. However, I have a difficulty with the proposal to do this by way of an addition to the Planning and Development Bill. For three years we have been promised local government reform legislation. We have been repeatedly told on the Order of Business that, in the words of the old Guinness add, &ldquo;Tá sé ag teacht&rdquo;. It was supposed to be introduced before the local elections last year, then some time during the summer, then in autumn, then around Christmas, then after Christmas, then before Easter and now it has been promised for some time after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriate place to introduce a provision on the term of office of city and county managers is in a local government Bill. When he is replying to the debate I would like the Minister of State to say whether the local government Bill is so far down the line that we cannot wait for its introduc<Col N="1257" /> tion to deal with the provision that relates to city and county managers.</P>
    <P>The second issue proposed is the tolling of roads. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is involved in a bit of a soft shuffle in relation to his powers. The Planning and Development Bill before the committee includes a number of provisions whereby the Minister is discreetly divesting himself of certain powers in relation to the approval of road schemes, etc., all of which is being shunted to An Bord Pleanála. I disagree with this because the Minister has those functions so he can be politically accountable to the House and the public for the decisions made on those projects. I do not agree that the Minister should divest himself of those powers to an unelected body for which he will not be accountable to the House. If it happens, when we raise questions about those functions in terms of a major motorway or road scheme we will receive an answer from the Ceann Comhairle's office stating the Minister is not answerable to the House.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister is proposing to divest his powers in relation to the tolling of roads. Let us be frank in saying this relates to a plan to toll additional roads. The Minister does not want to find himself with the political problem of having to make the final decisions on those matters. Therefore, before the issue of road tolling comes before him, and before there is any question of the Minister making decisions in this regard and being accountable to the House and the public, he has decided to shunt responsibility from himself to An Bord Pleanála. It is a cowardly act which is unworthy of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions relates to the tolling of non-national roads, something we will debate in greater detail when the exact proposals are brought before the committee. What exactly is happening? I understood the national plan included a consideration that some new road and motorway construction projects might be done through public-private partnerships and might have tolls on part of them. What non-national roads will be tolled? This is about the Minister shifting his direct responsibility and accountability to the House and the public to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity to blow the whistle on what is a very underhand proposal from the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>From the day I entered the House I understood that Second Stage was the time to debate points of principle. What is involved in this proposal is a point of principle, and what is happening is wrong. It is no wonder the public is losing confidence in the ability of the House to deal with legislation or issues when this is being hived off to a committee where it is hoped it will be slipped through without anybody knowing. I sincerely hope this matter will not be allowed slip through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> Deputy Gilmore has more or less said what I wanted to say about the local government reform legislation. To use a planning Bill to extend the contracts of county managers is quite outrageous. There are some very good managers, but there are also some bad ones and there is no question in this as to the role of elected members. Can the Minister tell me of any organisation or business in which elected members serve but have no say whatsoever in the appointment of the manager or the term of his or her contract? It is now proposed, by way of an amendment on Committee Stage, to give powers to individuals to decide for themselves whether they want to extend their contracts for another three years.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I tried to raise a matter by way of parliamentary question. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was very upset that I was raising a matter in the Dáil which he maintained was one for the local authority. It referred to the application of the letting housing priority scheme by a particular local authority. I got nowhere when I raised the question, but I decided to take up the Minister's offer, which I had already done, and I wrote directly to the county manager, pointing out the exact nature of my problem and enclosing a copy of the Dáil debate. That was approximately three months ago. I since sent a reminder and have not had the courtesy of a reply. The matter effects ordinary people in terms of their rights under the letting priority scheme. How can public representatives face their electorate and say they cannot get a reply from a county manager? In those circumstances, should I have the right to say I will not support the continuation of a manager's contract because I do not think he or she did a good job? I would have no problem if it was a matter for elected members of local authorities, but to provide an option to extend contracts for three years without reference to any person is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>The place to introduce such a provision is certainly not the Planning and Development Bill, especially when the Taoiseach has told us that the local government reform legislation will be introduced in the next couple of months. The provision should be included in that Bill, and I agree with Deputy Gilmore who knows exactly what I spoke of in terms of the housing problem as he supported me in the House, something for which I thank him. As a member of the particular local authority he was experiencing the same frustration. Three or four months later we still have not received a reply. I was first elected a member of a local authority 26 years ago and I cannot even get a reply from the county manager. The Government is now providing county managers with the right to extend their contracts by a further three years for the sake of stability.</P>
    <P>Regarding the principle of subsidiarity, since when does the vesting of a Minister's powers in a non-elected body where nobody is accountable adhere to the principle of subsidiarity? As Deputies Dukes and Gilmore rightly pointed out, <Col N="1259" /> if one tables a parliamentary question in regard to any of these issues, one is informed by the Ceann Comhairle's office that they are not matters for the Minister. Where does one go?</P>
    <P>The NRA is to be given powers to impose tolls but only at the direction of the Minister. Whether one agrees with tolling of major roads is a separate issue but there is a policy issue in so far as in 1977 the public was told that road tax was abolished. Today, all car owners pay road tax which is increased on a regular basis but it must blend in with the overall road infrastructure policy. I hope the Minister will withdraw the motion, having listened to the debate, and will reintroduce these proposals so that they can be discussed on Second Stage of the local government reform Bill and will not cause anybody any problems.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am also strongly opposed to what the Government is trying to do. It has become a habit of the Government to introduce primary legislation and then make substantial proposals which do not relate to it &ndash; the most blatant example related to an asylum seeker's right to appeal a decision upon rejection of his or her application. The Government amended the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, to include something entirely different in substance. A similar scenario pertains to this motion, which addresses two serious questions, the policy of road tolling and the tenure of county managers. I agree with previous speakers that these issues should be the subject of a Second Stage debate on amending legislation. The City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, is the most obvious legislation to deal with the tenure of county managers while the Local Government or Road Traffic Acts could address road tolling.</P>
      <P>The question of tolling for working people is a very important issue which deserves a full discussion. It is quite clear that private interests are lining up to create goldmines for themselves courtesy of the Government which will hand areas of the transport infrastructure in the form of roads over to them on which they can charge tolls. The West Link bridge over the M50 in my constituency is a goldmine. However, it is so at the expense of PAYE workers in the main who must use it to travel to and from work or when they are going about their business. Any amendment in that regard or the provision of new powers to anybody should be discussed properly in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable to introduce a proposal without a proper debate to extend the tenure of a county manager to ten years without imposing a democratic check in the normal way. We should have a considered amendment to legislation in regard to how people in these posts of responsibility are appointed and what democratic check could be undertaken in regard to their appointments so that they cannot act, as they do in some cases, like mini-dictators, completely casting aside what are often the reason<Col N="1260" /> able views of communities in their functional areas. These issues need to be discussed during a proper Second Stage debate and should not have been introduced through sleight of hand in this cynical manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speakers. It is amazing the Minister is introducing a proposal to extend the contracts of county managers. I recently tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in regard to new legislation on central heating. I asked him how many local authorities had obeyed his wish and, in particular, I queried the number of applications which had been processed by Westport, Ballina and Castlebar urban district councils. The answer was none, but I had to make a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, because the Minister and the local authority would not provide me with the information, yet the Government wants to extend the contracts of county managers, some of whom have seven year contracts. It does not matter whether they have performed well because if the Minister of the day likes the county manager and thinks he is the man for the job, he or she will sanction another three years. It is outrageous.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett referred to correspondence with county managers and other local officials. I would like the Minister to list examples of local authority officials answering letters from public representatives within seven days and providing a full reply within 14 days. Deputy Higgins is also right in that these people think that they are not answerable to the House or anybody else. It proves a point I have made in this House for many years. Who is running the country? Every Thursday evening, the 26 county managers meet in Dublin and they decide what will happen under the planning laws. The Government issues a policy and they do something else. The Government should address this problem. If Fianna Fáil backbenchers allow the passage of this motion, God help them when they want replies to their queries, given that the current Minister is trying to abolish the dual mandate for Oireachtas Members. It will be a sad day for democracy.</P>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1999: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage is the Minister proposing that all implications and costs of taking up life assurance products, including payment to the intermediary, are signed by the consumer? The full costs cannot be made available until the policy risk is underwritten by the insurance company and are, therefore, not available at point of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer has a right to replace existing policies and to avail of better terms and conditions because policies are updated on an <Col N="1261" /> ongoing basis. It does not automatically follow that such policies are mis-sold. With regard to non-life disclosure regulations, it is a total misnomer to suggest that because the consumer is fully aware of costs, discounts and loadings, he or she will be able to alleviate unnecessary cost burdens, such as the high cost of cover for young drivers. The Minister expects the consumer to make a choice of product based on price. However, she should be aware that the cheapest is not necessarily always the best and there are many intricate reasons, usually to the consumer's benefit, that one policy may be more expensive than another. For example, one company may charge a little more for mortgage protection but this policy may include cover on children's lives as well as parents whereas a cheaper policy may not. If consumers compare policies on price only they will lose out.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that due to lack of consumer interest in reinsurance, a &ldquo;light&rdquo; regulatory regime has been imposed. She should surely legislate at all times in the public interest and an absence of direct consumer interest should not give her a licence to ignore or neglect any area of legislation. I am pleased that she has decided to address the position of reinsurance companies and they will be subject to all insurance legislation. Reinsurance costs indirectly impact on the consumer.</P>
    <P>Part II relates to amendments to the 1989 Act. The Minister has agreed with the reinsurance undertakings to balance the need to protect the reputation of the financial services sector with the desire not to impose an unnecessary regulatory burden on reputable reinsurance companies. This is in contrast to her attitude of imposing a regime of robust regulatory and enforcement powers under the 1995 Act to supervise insurance intermediaries. Is the Minister now proposing one law for foreign companies in the IFSC and another for indigenous insurance intermediaries? He should provide for equity in regulations as applies to all sectors of the industry.</P>
    <P>The definition in section 22 of &ldquo;cash&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-cash&rdquo; handlers is over-simplified. The Minister is making such definitions without any scope to deal with the exceptions in the daily transactions of business. There should be some provision for brokers to handle small amounts of cash.</P>
    <P>On section 27, if the Insurance Bill, 1999, is a fair and equitable measure it should be applied to all sections of the industry. Can the Minister explain the reason he is excluding travel agents and tour operators from the Bill? The costs and charges applied to these types of insurance impact on the consumer who risks the possibility of paying too much for travel insurance and, under this proposed legislation, they will not be given sight of these costs and charges.</P>
    <P>On section 29, the Minister is asking for too much information to be placed on letterheads and business cards. This is only likely to confuse the consumer regarding the status of intermediaries <Col N="1262" /> and therefore deter him or her from taking out insurance or pension policies.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in its current format, is flawed in certain areas as it proposes to exclude group pensions, life and PHI schemes with more than three members from the proposed disclosure regulations. These will then be controlled by the Pensions Board which will be outside the control of the single regulator. As I stated earlier, it is also proposed to exclude travel agents and tour operators from the disclosure regulations. This is not full disclosure and since the Minister is not introducing full disclosure on products which are of importance to the consumer, I cannot understand the reason he has continually refused to accept the argument of the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, the Irish Brokers Association and the Consumers' Association of Ireland to remove pure protection products from the disclosure regulations as commission disclosure on these products will have no material effect on the consumer.</P>
    <P>The brokers consider, along with other industry bodies including the Irish Insurance Federation, that the code of conduct under section 37 is inappropriate for insurance intermediaries. They believe a specific code of conduct for insurance intermediaries should be scripted to take into consideration the particularities of the insurance market. To bring insurance intermediaries under a common code of conduct would be impractical and unworkable for the following reasons: the nature of the business transacted by insurance intermediaries is significantly different to that transacted by investment intermediaries; the distribution channels are such that a significant proportion of business is transacted by direct writers who would not come within the scope of the code of conduct; the Insurance Act, 1989, code of conduct for insurance intermediaries, approved by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, could be used to draft a specific code of conduct for insurance intermediaries. This code sets out requirements in respect of dealings with clients and insurers. The importance of utmost good faith and the significance of non-disclosure are emphasised. If the supervisory authority were to issue a code of conduct for insurance intermediaries under section 37, it has no discretion to exclude any of the areas noted in paragraphs a to g of section 37(1). An insurance intermediary would be required therefore to disclose commissions in its dealings with clients in all life and non-life insurance contracts. The brokers suggest that they could not support the position of such a code as discussions are ongoing in relation to the issue of disclosure of commission on pure protection insurance contracts and the manner of disclosure. A specific code of conduct for insurance intermediaries could deal with the issue of commission disclosure by including a requirement to comply with regulations made under section 43 of the Insurance Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The existing section 37(1) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, should be amended so <Col N="1263" /> that it would be exclusively for the use of non-insurance intermediaries. The Minister should examine that section. An excellent draft was included in the 1995 Act which clearly stated the case for the brokers.</P>
    <P>The insertion of section 31 in the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, excluding travel agents and tour operators from the application of Part IV of that Act, is inconsistent with legislative developments. The new Bill endeavours to strengthen consumer protection and ensure consistency of standards in the financial services sector. In this context, I see no reason for the exemption of travel agents and tour operators from the provision of Part IV of the Act. To ensure adequate consumer protection, no exemption should exist to the scope of the Act. The same standards and requirements should be imposed on all product distributors.</P>
    <P>I oppose the prescriptive nature of section 29 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, as currently stated. The supervisory authorities should retain the power to require intermediaries to disclose information on stationery and in all advertisements regarding status as appropriate. The quantity of information currently disclosed on investment intermediaries' stationery is such that the consumers are not reading the small print. That is an important point that the Minister should consider because one can get stationery in any company. Our party intends to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to allocate responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of insurance intermediaries. The Central Bank has been chosen as the regulatory authority and the powers available to it under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, are being extended for that purpose. Any legislation that sets out to provide greater openness, transparency and accountability in regard to the insurance sector has to be welcomed in principle, but there are a number of significant question marks about the Bill which will need to be examined closely on Committee Stage.  Anything regarding insurance or assurance is complex and difficult to understand. We all know this from trying to interpret or understand our own insurance policies. Most consumers find life assurance products in particular to be opaque, unintelligible and difficult to make informed decisions on. There is no reason the consumer should not have the right to intelligible, pre-contractual and post-contractual information on the main features of any life assurance product. It would appear that the brokers regard it as being in their interests to maintain the mystery and to avoid simplifying the presentation to consumers. Why should there not be complete transparency on all charges and expenses? Since it would be a level playing field, why should it impact disproportionately on any brokering company? In what is surely a classic case of understatement, the explanatory memor<Col N="1264" /> andum for the Bill states that there is currently a lack of transparency and an information deficit associated with the sale of insurance policies. I do not believe that it is beyond the capacity of the industry to make policies and documents more accessible and understandable.</P>
      <P>Considerable sums can be invested in insurance and assurance policies and people are entitled to know beyond doubt what they are required to pay, who gets what in terms of where their money will go and what their entitlements will be. While the vast majority of those involved in the insurance industry are honest and hard-working people committed to doing the best possible for their clients, there is no doubt that the industry has been seriously damaged by the unacceptable activities of some. People were shocked at disclosures regarding the practice known as churning or mis-selling of policies. Serious allegations were made against Irish Life which resulted in the company having to offer compensation to many of its clients. There have also been a number of cases of irregularities involving brokers and others involved in selling insurance policies.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has been selected as the regulatory authority. In itself, this decision makes sense. It is absurd to have a situation where investment intermediaries are supervised by the Central Bank while insurance intermediaries, to the extent that they are supervised at all, fall under the Minister's jurisdiction.  Very few consumers would be able to tell whether the complex financial instruments now on offer as investment vehicles would fall to be classed as insurance policies. In many cases, there may be an insurance element as part of an overall package. However, this legislation, which is, of course, confined to the insurance industry, must be seen against the background of Government proposals, decisions and reports on the regulation of the financial services sector generally and the subsequent failure to proceed with the blueprint which the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance jointly commissioned.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 the Government agreed to the establishment, at the earliest opportunity, of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. It appointed an implementation advisory group to be chaired by the current Attorney General to progress the necessary work and this group reported in May last year. The group's point of departure was the decision, in principle, by the Government that there should be a single regulatory authority. In that context, it recommended that the single regulatory authority should be established as soon as possible through the minimum legislation necessary to effectively fulfil its remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, therefore, the existing statutory basis for regulation in the various sectors should be maintained and simple amending legislation should transfer responsibility to the single regulatory authority. Consolidating legislation could be enacted afterwards. In this way the existing statutory basis for regulation would be main<Col N="1265" /> tained and the necessary amending legislation would simply transfer responsibility for its execution to the new single regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>The group considered that, proceeding on such a basis, the establishment of the SRA could realistically be achieved within one year of a Government decision. It added that it would not be inconsistent with this approach to consider the appointment of an interim board of the SRA in advance of the enactment of the necessary legislation. There has been no decision by the Government regarding how to proceed on foot of this report. There is no pending or promised legislation dealing with the establishment of an SRA. No decision has been taken as to whether the Central Bank should be given this role or whether a green field authority should be established.</P>
    <P>The McDowell advisory group was asked to advise the Government on the range of financial service providers to be overseen by the new authority. The group developed a set of criteria to be used in determining whether individual financial service providers should be overseen by this new body. It agrees that all financial service providers should, in principle, be dealt with by the SRA and that a compelling case would have to be made for the exclusion of any provider from its remit. The group decided that it should be guided by the twin needs of ensuring that sound prudential practices are followed throughout the financial services industry in order that the integrity of the financial system is protected and also ensuring that a proper regime is in place for the adequate and appropriate protection of consumers in relation to financial services provided to them.</P>
    <P>The group agreed that, where possible, the SRA should offer a one stop shop service both to financial service providers and to consumers in respect of their dealings with that sector. The group, therefore, concluded that the remit of the SRA should encompass the full range of bodies currently regulated by the Central Bank with the exception of payment systems &ndash; namely, banks, building societies and other credit institutions, stock brokers, money brokers and so on &ndash; and also those regulated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which primarily covers financial services provided by the insurance industry. The Department supervises the financial behaviour of the industry from a prudential perspective and is also concerned with consumer protection matters which involve pursuing a fair conduct of business regime to ensure the maximum possible transparency for members of the public in relation to the marketing of insurance products.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, consistent with the principles underlining the Government decision taken as its point of departure by the McDowell advisory group and with the criteria set out in its report, the yet to be established SRA should be the primary source of regulation of the insurance industry, both as prudential supervision and consumer protection. That group specifically recommended <Col N="1266" /> that insurance intermediaries, both agents and brokers, should be subject to regulation by the SRA.</P>
    <P>As regards the structure and location of the SRA, the recommendations of the majority of the group are clear. The authority should be an entirely new independent organisation. It should have a public interest board, the non-executive members of which should be selected for their experience of legal, financial and consumer issues. The board should comprise nine members, six of whom, including the chairperson, should be appointed by the Minister for Finance following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The board should also include a chief executive officer, a consumer protection director and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There was, however, a minority report along predictable lines and a turf war is now in progress. The alternative model provides for the establishment of an SRA, with consumer protection functions, within the Central Bank. It was argued that this model could provide for a high level of accountability to the Minister for Finance and the Oireachtas. The authors seemed to ignore the fact that it is the complete absence of any degree of accountability on the part of the Central Bank which led to the need for a review of financial regulation in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The authors of the minority report believed that there could be operational autonomy for a commissioner of regulation working within the Central Bank and answerable to its board only in relation to policy matters. The model would preserve what is already working well. They stated that the track record of the Central Bank in regard to its regulatory functions is extremely good and that there is considerable support among entities already regulated by it for it to become the new regulator. The reality is that if a new body is to be established, a single financial regulator vested with functions previously exercised both by the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the loss of the Irish currency the bank will lose the main reason for its existence. The failure of the Government to resolve the principal issue surrounding the establishment of a new regulator has meant the collapse of the indicative timeframe set out in the McDowell report for the introduction of legislation. What we are considering now is legislation which should already be out of date.</P>
    <P>Again, the explanatory memorandum states that self-regulation of insurance intermediaries has proved inadequate and is considered inappropriate to an area of fundamental importance to consumer welfare. The Labour Party would go further and state that self-regulation generally in the financial sector, particularly where the interests of consumers are at stake, is inappropriate. Given what we have learned in recent years from various tribunals, the DIRT inquiry and other disclosures, it is understandable that the <Col N="1267" /> faith of the public in the financial sector generally has been shaken and that it is no longer prepared to rely on self-regulation. It is disappointing to note, for example, that despite the revelations of the DIRT inquiry, organisations such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland are still pleading the right to self-regulation and are resisting attempts to impose outside supervision. The insurance industry has not entirely escaped the questions, which have entered the public domain, affecting other areas of the financial sector. Given the proliferation of intermediary businesses, there is an even greater need to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>The McDowell group considered the bodies regulated by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Friendly Societies. It decided that, in principle, all bodies engaged in financial services should come under the SRA but that each of these categories would have to be examined on its merits. The role of the Director of Consumer Affairs arises from the Consumer Credit Act, 1995. Under that Act, the director has responsibility for the regulation of the types of service providers engaged in consumer credit transactions as well as general issues relating to fair trade.</P>
    <P>The McDowell group agreed it was appropriate that the functions relating to the regulation of service providers, including the notification of charges, should be transferred to the SRA. However, what it described as the conduct of business role more closely linked to general consumer protection, should continue to be carried out by the Director of Consumer Affairs. This would encompass such matters as misleading advertising, unfair terms and unfair contracts. The group admitted that there was scope for confusion in relation to such a demarcation between the authority and the director in relation to consumer complaints. It recommended an agreed structure for addressing the issue by way of a memorandum of understanding providing for co-operation between the two bodies.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no reason such a demarcation of responsibilities between the authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs should not apply equally to both investments by consumers and consumer credit transactions. However, there is no provision in the Bill for placing under the supervision of the Director of Consumer Affairs those consumer protection aspects of the statutory regime under which the insurance industry operates and which ought, more properly, to be regulated by the director. As the Minister points out, there is currently a lack of transparency and an information deficit associated with the sale of insurance products. I welcome the provision which enables the Minister, by regulation, to introduce provision of information requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister's stated objectives are to enhance and strengthen consumer disclosure measures, procure an end to over-complication in presentation of products, increase competition while <Col N="1268" /> maintaining a high level of consumer protection, address mis-selling and to create greater transparency of charges, expenses and prices. The achievement of these objectives requires not just a regulatory framework but an active and effective enforcement authority. These are matters which should fall within the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Is it intended that the director will lose all responsibilities in the financial services area when and if the SRA is established?</P>
    <P>Another area of concern which the Bill seeks to address is the operation of reinsurance companies located in this country, mainly in the International Financial Services Centre. Up to this there has been little or no supervision of this sector. The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 16 January last carried details of two reinsurance companies located in the IFSC which were being investigated not by the Irish authorities but by the serious fraud office in the UK.</P>
    <P>The main justification for introducing new measures in this Bill regarding the operation of reinsurance companies is to protect the reputation of the Irish financial services sector. That is a desirable objective but there is also an obligation on us to provide protection for clients of firms who may be using Irish territory. In this regard it is surprising that the Minister has chosen to take the minimalist option in section 5 by simply increasing the notification requirements and reserving the right, in section 6, to make regulations providing for stronger supervision and regulation of reinsurance undertakings if the provisions of section 5 do not prove satisfactory. Given the problems highlighted in the <i>Sunday</i><i>Tribune</i>, there is a case for moving directly to the powers provided in section 6.</P>
    <P>These companies are part of the wider problem of Irish registered non-resident companies about which we know remarkably little. What we know gives grounds for serious concern that these firms can do serious damage to the reputation and standing of this country. There are more than 40,000 Irish registered, non-resident companies incorporated in the State. Many of these, it is accepted, are being operated for the benefit of people involved in fraud, money laundering and possibly drug dealing. Many of them, nobody knows how many, are located in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>As a result of the controversy about these companies, amendments were introduced in the 1999 Finance Act requiring them to register with the Revenue Commissioners. However, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, recently revealed some startling figures when he told the Dáil that of the almost 40,000 companies written to by the Revenue Commissioners, just 5,512 had made returns. A total of 24,095 failed to reply and another 9,389 letters were sent back to the Revenue Commissioners indicating that the addressee was unknown. This suggests that there is still a serious problem with these companies which needs to be addressed in a more vigorous way. We were aggrieved at how places such as the Cayman Islands, Jersey and the Isle of Man <Col N="1269" /> were used to facilitate tax evasion and to hide the unacceptable activities of some members of our business sector. We should ensure, therefore, that our territory is not used to hide illegality or criminality.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill requiring full disclosure of information by insurance companies is also welcome, if much delayed. My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, was strongly critical of the Minister of State's decision last October to lift the cap on commissions that insurance companies can pay brokers without simultaneously introducing regulations to require the disclosure of commission levels to consumers. The delay in introducing regulations requiring disclosure of commission levels is hard to understand. These regulations were prepared by Deputy Rabbitte before he left the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment more than two and a half years ago and there is no reason for them not to be given effect by the current Minister.</P>
    <P>Life assurance policies are, of their nature, complicated and often barely comprehensible documents for members of the public. It is essential that there be procedures in place to provide information in the simplest possible form on all details of hidden charges and extras, especially when the Consumers' Association reports some instances of commission of up to 60% being charged. The draft regulations prepared by Deputy Rabbitte when he was Minister of State with responsibility for the industry were designed to do this and to ensure that consumers would be aware of commission payments, especially in light of the negative impact these can have on values in the early years of policies.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has proclaimed in the past that his preferred disclosure regime might have been vulnerable to constitutional challenge. He did not provide the House with the basis for this conclusion. It allowed him to put most of the contemplated measures on hold pending the enactment of this legislation. It now appears that he intends to start the interminable consultation process again. None of this, however, prevented the Minister from lifting the cap on commission paid.</P>
    <P>The need for disclosure of payments of commission to brokers was accepted by the industry as inevitable as long as three years ago. Unfortunately, since the Minister of State took office, Deputy Treacy has given the impression that he is a virtual prisoner of the brokers with the needs and entitlements of consumers taking second place. He now has the opportunity to show that this is not the case by ensuring that regulations with real teeth are introduced and there is no time lag between the enactment of the Bill and the introduction of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I presume the disclosure regime will be extended beyond the commission issue and sales remuneration. I am anxious to hear the Minister's comments on this. Presumably protection only policies will be included in the disclosure regime given the success of the disclosure of these mat<Col N="1270" /> ters in relation to policies connected to buying a house, as required under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries in which the consumer can have confidence is a major issue. The allocation of this power to the Central Bank under the provisions of the Investment Intermediaries Act is welcome. However, it is odd that the House is required to enact this legislation when neither Deputies nor the Central Bank know whether it will continue to be the financial regulator. It is unfortunate that considerable uncertainty has been generated by the continuing conflict between the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste. The Labour Party cannot see how such a dispute is amenable to the usual fudge. There is no halfway house and we are being asked to process this Bill in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the speedy passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill is divided into three parts but contains two central elements. First, it introduces a stricter means of regulating insurance intermediaries, namely those companies which seek to provide insurance services to customers. The Bill will also include investment business firms. Second, the legislation introduces a more stringent system of consumer protection to protect people who use the services of insurance intermediaries. This is of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>For too long consumers have not been given proper protection with regard to the products they purchase and the services they use. For most of the last century the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> was the normal yardstick for consumers. &ldquo;Let the buyer beware&rdquo; more or less ensured that the onus of responsibility for defective products or the provision of negligent services was on the customer who purchased those products or used those services. While a common law of negligence was built up in Irish courts during that time, few statutes providing for consumer protection were enacted. In fact, it was the early 1980s and 1990s before legislation was enacted with the central theme of consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of this legislation, while supported by the political parties, was inspired by the EU. An independent directorate dealing with consumer protection was set up within the European Commission. European Union treaties began to give the Union more powers to bring forward legislation in the consumer affairs area. Under the Amsterdam Treaty the EU has the power to bring forward legislation in the public health area, with particular emphasis on protecting human health. Members will agree that the new EU Commissioner for food safety and consumer health, Mr. David Byrne, has mastered his brief and is introducing many measures which will protect and enhance consumers' rights in Europe. A <Col N="1271" /> new European food safety authority will be established, while widespread information campaigns on the introduction of the new euro currency are taking place across Europe. It is in the spirit of all these changes that the Government has introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the allocation of responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank. This power is available to the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. Provision for the regulation of insurance intermediaries was first introduced into law by means by the Insurance Act, 1989. This provided for a relatively simple system of self regulation by the insurance industry, but it did not prove sufficient and is considered inappropriate to an area of such fundamental importance to consumer welfare. The Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, introduced detailed procedures for the regulation of investment intermediaries with regulatory responsibility allocated to the Central Bank and to the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The extensive powers available to the Central Bank under the Act are more comprehensive and are better suited to the task of regulating insurance intermediaries than the minimalist legislation set out in the Insurance Act, 1989. In addition, there has been an increasing overlap between the activities of insurance intermediaries and investment intermediaries with the creation of more complex financial instruments, many of which straddle both activities.</P>
    <P>Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, an investment business firm must be authorised to operate in this State by a competent authority, in this case the Central Bank. Under EU legislation, an investment business firm may operate in the State where it has been authorised by the appropriate competent authority in another EU member state. The Bill amends definitions and individual sections of the 1995 Act to provide for the application of the Investment Intermediaries Act to this legislation. As a result of these changes, an insurance intermediary will come within the definition of an investment business firm, thus providing the necessary linkage between insurance intermediaries and the 1995 Act. This allocated regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There is currently a lack of transparency and an information deficit associated with the sale of insurance products in Ireland. The Bill enables the Government to introduce information requirements additional to existing measures at EU level. A strong legal basis is required for this since existing insurance and consumer protection legislation has proved deficient. The objective of introducing such legislation is to enhance and strengthen consumer disclosure measures, to procure an end to over-complication in the representation of products and to increase competition <Col N="1272" /> while maintaining a high level of consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The mis-selling of products must also be addressed and greater transparency with regard to charges, expenses and prices for insurance products must be put in place. It is also proposed to make use of powers provided in the Bill to make disclosure regulations for life assurance products as soon as possible after the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The issue of strengthening the legislation for reinsurance companies is dealt with in Part II, section 6. The Government will be able at a future date to introduce a statutory system of authorisation and supervision of reinsurance companies if such actions are required. The main justification for these measures is to protect the reputation of the Irish financial services sector. At present an informal system of authorisation and reinsurance companies operate. While this has worked satisfactorily to date, it is considered necessary to make provision for a more formal regime which could be introduced, if necessary at short notice.</P>
    <P>The proposal to proceed in this manner has come about after extensive discussions with insurance representative bodies, who have indicated their broad support for such measures. It must be noted that a central reason for such legislation is to build consumer confidence. I would be disappointed if the insurance companies in Ireland were not satisfied with it because it is in their interests as much as consumers.</P>
    <P>The task of considering the most suitable regime for overseeing reinsurance is likely to fall to the new single financial regulator, which will operate under the aegis of the Department of Finance. These new powers are far reaching in their implications. However, if the important provisions of this legislation are to be enforced a tough enforcement regime must be in operation to guarantee the implementation of the legislation in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important and long overdue Bill. Its purpose is to allocate regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank and to utilise the regulatory powers available to the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. The Bill also enables the Minister to make disclosure regulations to require insurance undertakings and intermediaries to make relevant information of a specified nature available to insurance companies. It also strengthens the existing system of notification of reinsurance undertakings to enable the Minister to make regulation for their authorisation and supervision. The Bill also updates the provisions for offences and penalties and enhances the powers of authorised officers for the purpose of the insurance Acts and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been introduced in response to the increasing complexity of Irish financial activities. Over the years there has been an understandable <Col N="1273" /> blurring of the margins between the insurance and investment industries. Many years ago the world of financial services was much more simple, but over the decades, and especially in recent times, it has become more complex. As a result many operators are crossing into areas that were traditionally not their domain. People now cover a much greater range of activities and in view of this, it is important that the proper regulatory framework is in place.</P>
    <P>This area came to my attention in the early to middle 1980s when I took out a mortgage to pay for my house. At that time endowment mortgages had become very fashionable. In the past ten to 15 years people have begun to question the value of them, but I recall that as a young person it was hard to resist the claims of people in the industry who said the new mortgage product, requiring an investment on a monthly basis which allowed for tax relief on the life assurance aspect, would enable investors to, in all probability, build up a capital fund two and three times in excess of the original sum borrowed. This would enable the borrower to clear the original capital at the end of the mortgage period and have a substantial nest-egg for later life.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that was not the experience of most people because the endowment mortgages were based on wild assumptions about growth in life assurance policies and stock exchange shares and investment returns of the order of 8%, 9% and 10% were envisaged. It was not prudent and I regret legislation was not in place then to protect the members of the public, many of whom suffered badly from the mad rush into endowment policies. Recently, people have moved back to fixed rate and variable policies. It has been a learning experience, all at the expense of the consumer.</P>
    <P>When a new policy is issued which is presented as a great opportunity for the customer, I advise people to ask why is there is new product on the market. The only reason a company puts a new product on the market is to make additional money. It does not do so for the good of the consumer or if the product is a loss-maker. That is the nature of business and, as my colleague, Deputy Collins, said, the traditional approach to these matters is <i>caveat emptor</i>, let the purchaser beware. Unfortunately, the purchaser is not always as well informed as the person selling the product, which is why it is more difficult for them. I am pleased new regulations will be introduced to help the general public understand more clearly and transparently the products on offer, the commission available and what they will receive and that the small print which might have tripped them up in the past will be more transparent.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry is a massive one worth billions of pounds per annum. The scale is unbelievable. Some 10,500 employees are directly employed in the system with 6,500 people acting as agents, brokers or tied agents. The scale of activity is phenomenal. Given that scale, it is <Col N="1274" /> important we have good strong regulations. Some 64% of the insurance business is life insurance and 34% is non-life. Of the life insurance business, 50% is dealt with directly by brokers and 24% by agents. The balance is dealt with primarily by the companies who issue the policies through their own direct sales staff. Some 70% of the non-life business is handled by intermediaries. The largest part of this sector is motor insurance which accounts for 55% of the non-life area. The importance of this area cannot be understated and it is significant.</P>
    <P>We can all recall when we had to debate special legislation dealing with a major problem in the largest car insurer in the country, PMPA. The Dáil had to respond on that occasion when faced with a difficulty in the marketplace. There was also the fiasco a number of years ago of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. I hope this legislation will ensure such situations never happen again and that the insured public will not be put under serious threat.</P>
    <P>The car insurance industry is unique. We are fortunate it is not State-run or semi-State-run and that it is run by private companies. It is one of the few areas in society where there is a legal requirement for people to take out an insurance policy from a private company. No other sector in society has such legislation in place forcing the public to do business with people in private companies. There is nothing wrong with that. It is just that it is unique. Since legislation forces people to take out car insurance, which is correct, we must also ensure the intermediaries who sell these policies are properly licensed and regulated.</P>
    <P>The legislation is welcome and long overdue. Given the scale of activity, it is something which will have an impact on every household in Ireland. Even though most people would view the Bill as technical, it has important ramifications. The new single regulatory authority in the financial services sector will also be put in place soon and this legislation will be within the remit of that authority. It is a measure of the importance and seriousness of this issue that we are introducing legislation at this stage and not letting it wait until after the authority is established. It is essential it be done now. No doubt it will be revisited in light of the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill will clearly outline and make transparent for consumers the commission rates earned by brokers, agents and tied agents, and it will make it much more difficult for people to churn policies. There is nothing more distressing for a person than to pay into a life insurance policy for two, three or four years and, if they change employment or leave it and cannot take the policy with them, to have it valued and find that it is worth less than what they contributed due to the heavy commission rates front-loaded on the policy. It is important people are fully aware of this when they take out policies and the legislation will be of major assistance in that regard.</P>
    <P>The life insurance policy sector is very important and not just for the private sector. As <Col N="1275" /> an example of how importantly it is treated by the Government, before Christmas we enacted legislation called the Temporary Holding Fund for Superannuation Liabilities Bill to allow the Government to invest £4 billion to £5 billion in a superannuation fund to fund pensions for the future, both for social welfare recipients and those in the employment of the State, either in the civil or public service. Their pensions must be paid when they retire and, rather than it being paid from the Exchequer on an annual basis, it is more prudent for the State to invest in such a fund to help fund State and social welfare pensions. To an extent, the State through that legislation mirrored what people have done privately. The National Treasury Management Agency will handle that fund and it is best equipped to do so. I am sure it will manage it excellently as it has managed the national debt.</P>
    <P>It is also important to have legislation covering this area because life insurance policies must exist for many years. It is not an ordinary retail trade situation where a person buys a product and, if the company goes bust in five or ten years' time, it does not matter to him or her. People who invest money in a life insurance company are in it for the long haul and they want the confidence and assurance that the companies with which they deal are also there for the long haul and will be around to pay the pensions and life insurance policies later in their lives. People need that assurance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. If one considers that most households have either life, car, house and contents, health or mortgage protection insurance policies, one begins to see the scale of the insurance industry, so the legislation we are debating will have a major impact on all households in the country. When it is passed, we will be better for it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact we are discussing this legislation. It is important because it introduces regulatory structures for the insurance industry. It will simplify the terms of insurance policies for the consumer. We all know how our eyes glaze over when we are handed insurance policies and the writing becomes smaller as each page is turned. In such circumstances, consumers are less willing to read the small print. Nonetheless, it is important they are protected whenever they wish to buy a product. The legislation will help ensure there is no mis-selling or churning of insurance policies. Many of us were scandalised when we heard that this practice was engaged in by one of the major insurance companies. Most of us only heard the word &ldquo;churning&rdquo; referred to when a person was making butter. Suddenly we had a new word in our vocabulary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> This is only half a Bill and I hope the Minister of State, in reply, will tell us when he will bring in legislation to cover the rest of the insurance industry. The regulations he proposes to introduce arising out of this legislation do not cover the non-life area and it is important he tells us when he will finish the work on this issue. It is a pity that when the Minister of State took office he spent a number of Question Times telling us he was going to introduce disclosure regulations. I think his aim was to do it by September 1997, but certainly by September 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State was not appointed until October. They were certainly to be introduced by September 1998. There was no question of legislation being needed for the regulations. However, wisdom prevailed somewhere in the Department. Many people probably pointed out to the Minister of State that he needed legislation to introduce the regulations. That is correct because these regulations need to be underpinned by legislation. Deputy Upton was right to raise the issue of why the Minister of State had not introduced them earlier. However, he will be forced to introduce the regulations under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the recent statement by the Consumers' Association of Ireland that commission on pure protection products, that is, term life and critical illness policies, should not be subject to disclosure? The Minister should revisit this area before he introduces the regulations. It is not relevant to have disclosure for policies with no endowment elements or no payment, other than if the person dies. All sectors of the industry are making this point to the Minister of State and, as I said, the Consumers' Association of Ireland recently stated that regulations are not needed in that area.</P>
      <P>The thrust of this legislation must be to simplify the whole insurance industry for the consumer and to underpin the people who are working validly and legitimately in this area, particularly the 50% of business contracted by independent brokers. They need this legislation to underpin what they are doing and to prevent cowboys entering the industry and undermining its good name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress again some figures which were given by my colleague, Deputy Perry, but which may have gone unnoticed. Only 52% of public and private sector employees have pension schemes. Only 27% of self-employed people have any pension provision. Only 12% of those in the agricultural sector have any pension provision. Some 40% of males and 48% of females have no <Col N="1277" /> provision made for life cover. The average life cover is less than £50,000, which is not enough these days.</P>
    <P>I am frightened by the number of people in society who have no life cover. This places a huge burden on their families and the social welfare system and brings about great hardship. I am particularly concerned about the 48% of females who have no life cover because an increasing number of women are the sole breadwinners for their families. Many single parent families are headed up by women, whether through widowhood, separation, desertion or having children outside marriage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not do anything that would discourage people from taking out life cover and pension cover. People must be encouraged to take out cover. That is not a plea for any particular sector of the industry but a plea for the consumer. Many people need to be educated about the need to make provision for their retirements or in case they develop ill health or die and leave dependants. The emphasis in any insurance legislation must be on the type of product that is available, that it is a good product for the consumer and that consumers can see what they are buying, the value they are getting and the commission being collected.</P>
    <P>Many issues have been raised with me and others about some of the flaws in the legislation. Who will pay for the implementation of this new regulation system? Will it be the consumer, or will the Minister be able to ensure the consumer does not end up carrying the can? This morning I saw a sign in a hairdressing salon in my constituency which stated the salon regretted it had to increase the cost of all its services to pay the extra wage bill because of the minimum wage. I have not had time to investigate that. However, I had to pay an extra £2.50 charge for the hair set I got this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. Every client has to pay an extra £2.50. I do not deny the staff of that or any other hairdressing salon the extra money needed to bring them up to the minimum wage &ndash; it is a disgrace they were below it. However, I wonder if the Minister was aware this would happen.</P>
      <P>This legislation must ensure a level playing field. I have great concerns about the element of the legislation that will allow group schemes to be excluded if they deal with policies of more than three people. All the small brokers will suffer as a result of this because they almost always provide pension schemes for very small companies with one or two staff. The Minister has excluded the big group life assurance companies. Pension and permanent health policies will be excluded if more than three people are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that he will re-examine the new section 43E inserted by section 7, which deals with where the client has previously <Col N="1278" /> cancelled a policy about which the sale person in the new case knows nothing. In such cases, the replacement policy should be excluded from the anti-churning provisions. It is possible a person might not know another person's policy had been cancelled. That person would then be guilty of an offence. The Minister should carefully consider some alternative wording to protect people who sell insurance policies not knowing they are assisting in a wrongful selling.</P>
    <P>The new section 43B imposes an obligation on life assurance companies and intermediaries to provide information before the conclusion of a policy. At present, some information must be disclosed under the 1994 life assurance framework regulations. Since this is generally provided at the same time as the cooling off notice, it is important that this provision comes into force at the same time as section 43E. I know this point has been made to the Minister of State's Department by the Insurance Federation of Ireland. I would like him to confirm that he will reconsider it.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the new section 43D is as specific as possible. An insurance agent will have to disclose the commission on the policy being purchased by the customer. The looseness of the language in section 43D appears to imply that the agent has to give every single bit of information about the distribution, conclusion and issue of policies. The words &ldquo;marketing, sale, distribution&rdquo; should probably be deleted. We can discuss this in further detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister decided in section 27 to exclude policies taken out through travel agents? Why should they not have to disclose their commission? Sections 9 and 10 refer to the new powers for the authorised officers. The Minister should look carefully at these sections to make sure they are as close as possible to the same sections in the Companies Act so that there will not be a discrepancy between the authorised officer's powers under that Act and those in the Insurance Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but we will be looking at a number of sections very closely on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill subject to the difficulties outlined by Deputy Owen and Deputy Perry being overcome. While there is some need for improvement, the Bill's objective is good in that it seeks to protect the customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech to the House on 2 March, the Minister of State said the Bill will &ldquo;lead to greater competition on the market, thus reducing the price of insurance&rdquo;. That is a very important issue which should be addressed. I have repeatedly spoken about another way the price of insurance could be reduced, which is by tackling the compensation culture. Over the past ten years we have been asking various Ministers to examine the difficulties experienced in the insurance industry, including the cost to those who pay insurance premiums and the scandals surrounding <Col N="1279" /> the level of claims and the compensation that is paid.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are involved in local government know about the level of claims being made. It is often suggested that 20% of such claims are spurious but I would say the real number far exceeds that figure. People do not take responsibility any more for their own safety and do not accept blame when they have been irresponsible. People try to place the blame elsewhere, but they should accept responsibility for their actions.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission should prepare a detailed report on how this issue can be tackled. Ireland is one of the most litigious countries in Europe. The compensation culture is like a cancer eating into our society and it almost borders on the immoral. The State must move quickly to halt the slide down a slippery slope to where all commercial and service industry will grind to a halt. We are less competitive in industry and commerce than our partners in Europe because of the level of payment of compensation and the consequential increase in insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, IBEC calculated that if we had the same level of insurance payments in the area of employers' liability as other countries, over a four year period some 10,000 jobs would be created because of the improved level of efficiency. We are uncompetitive in many areas, especially in manufacturing where we are in competition with our European partners, because of the level of claims taken against employers.</P>
    <P>Young people cannot obtain motor insurance, but why must insurance premiums be so high for them? They are many times higher than in the UK or elsewhere in the EU because the level of compensation payments are way ahead of that of our continental partners.</P>
    <P>There is also the practice of insurance companies coming to agreements. They do so because claimants will settle for less rather than going to court, and this has been proven statistically. However, it creates a situation where people who make spurious claims do not even have to take the stand to give their side of the story. An agreement is reached on the steps of the court and they go away laughing.</P>
    <P>The system acts against the best interests of the genuine claimant who may have to wait many years for a resolution of his or her claim, with its consequential distress and uncertainty about the level of compensation. This discourages rehabilitation and a return to work. People are advised, if they have a claim against their employer, to delay returning to work until their claim is settled. This area of the courts is clogged with claims. People who are fit to return to work are advised in the interests of their claim not to do so. That is not in the interests of the claimant, the employer, industry and commerce, or the State.</P>
    <P>Insurance costs are creating complications for employers, businesses, motorists, public authorities, and voluntary and sporting organisations. No area has been spared the paralysis which has <Col N="1280" /> accompanied the escalation in litigation. For example, school teachers can no longer send a student to the nearest shop for a message. Open season has been declared on public houses, clubs, hotels and supermarkets by people who fall down in such premises. Once a person falls in any premises, the first thing to enter their minds is to make a claim. It is regarded as humorous and people joke about it, but it is a very serious matter. The compensation culture is pervasive and is on its way towards destroying ordinary decent people's enjoyment of life.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that anyone should be denied his or her legitimate and constitutional right to compensation for genuine personal injury claims. However, the constant and automatic reaction of a substantial number of people is to lodge a claim with a solicitor if they suffer the most trivial injury and, occasionally, when they do not suffer any injury at all. It is almost becoming the norm.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with claims against local authorities. A recent examination of the variety of claims lodged against local authorities is interesting. Claims are being lodged for every conceivable situation, including falling on roadways, footpaths and in playgrounds, falling from bicycles and motorcycles, driving into potholes, and for injuries caused by colliding with litter bins and when slates fall from public buildings.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems encountered, particularly by Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited, in seeking to defend public authorities is that many claims are not made for several months or even years after the date of the alleged accident. This can make it impossible for a local authority to investigate fully the circumstances of the alleged accident.</P>
    <P>An individual who alleges he sustained personal injuries as the result of falling into a pothole on a public road, need not submit his claim until two years and 364 days after the alleged incident. By this time the pothole has been filled in, the local authority has forgotten about it and was probably unaware that an incident had ever occurred at the location. There is no hope of seeking witnesses, presenting a cogent defence or disproving the claim.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should examine this serious situation. I have avoided mentioning litigation against the Department of Defence because this matter has been discussed at length in the House. I would draw the Minister's attention, however, to what has happened with the Army deafness claims, which represent another serious aspect of the same problem. The Minister must examine this area because we are compounding the difficulty. It seems to be open season for claims. We were told it could not be tackled before in the case of owner occupiers, but it was done under the terms of the Occupiers Liability Act. Many landowners were very happy with the effective way in which that problem was dealt with. This issue should be tackled in a similar fashion and with similar vigour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the various contributions that have been made to this debate by many Deputies. I thank them for raising the issues which they consider give cause for concern. Several of the proposals which have been made are such that I will need to reflect further on their implications before coming to a final decision regarding their inclusion in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Since its publication I am pleased to say there has been a broad welcome for the Bill from all quarters, including in the House. As might be expected, however, not all the Bill's provisions have met with universal acclaim. In particular, reservations have been expressed by some sections of the insurance industry on a number of our proposals to introduce disclosure requirements and the manner in which disclosure will be made.</P>
      <P>These proposals have come about as a result of a long-standing failure within the insurance industry as a whole to provide adequate comprehensible information to their many clients. In addition, this unsatisfactory situation left many vulnerable people at the mercy of unscrupulous individuals who engaged in the mis-selling and churning scandals that have come to light in recent years. We are determined that insurance consumers will be provided with sufficient information to enable them to make rational and informed choices about their insurance requirements and that the resulting competition in the marketplace will encourage the promotion of better products at a lower cost. In this regard I am indebted to the Society of Actuaries in Ireland for its assistance with the manner of presentation of the relevant facts and figures for insurance consumers in a simple and understandable manner which will form an integral part of the regulations to be made under this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged that as a result of the publicity surrounding the preparation of this Bill, a number of undertakings have already begun to take the initiative to improve the level and quality of information which they provide to their customers. I welcome this trend and I would like to see other undertakings follow suit even in advance of the new legislation coming into force. The insurance industry, which is a large employer and is an essential element of Ireland's social fabric can only benefit from such developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns were expressed about the restrictions which this Bill may put on intermediaries dealing with people who do not have bank accounts. We believe that many of these concerns are exaggerated and perhaps misplaced. First, it will be open to any insurance intermediary who wishes to accept cash from clients to apply to the supervisory authority for authorisation to do so. On receiving authorisation he or she will then be entitled to accept cash or other negotiable instruments which should be lodged to what is known as a section 52 account under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. The findings of a recent <Col N="1282" /> survey by the Irish Banking Information Service revealed that eight out of ten of the adult population who were over 18 years of age in Ireland hold deposit accounts, with seven out of ten adults holding current accounts in financial institutions. Given that many dependent teenagers have no need for such accounts and that a large number of couples hold a single or joint account, these figures would suggest that the number of people in this State who have cause to take out insurance policies but who do not hold current accounts is quite small indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It also gives the banks a great opportunity to know who is buying insurance and where to turn in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but the insurance industry is complaining that it needs current accounts and I am saying that they are already there. There is no need to panic.</P>
      <P>The realities of modern life mean that it is becoming increasingly difficult to administer the affairs of any household without the convenience of access to a bank or building society account of any type. Reference was also made to alleged sharp practice by the banks involving interference with customers, to which Deputy Owen referred, who are lodging lump sum drafts for clearance in advance of doing business with their insurance intermediary.</P>
      <P>Certain banks have been accused in the past of delaying the implementation of instructions from their customers as part of a tactic to influence them in their choice of insurance intermediary. The Central Bank took a very serious view of this disgraceful practice and issued written instructions to the banks to address this problem. These instructions require that all valid payment instruments must be processed on receipt and without recourse to the customer for the purpose of offering alternative services. Neither are banks permitted to offer personal information regarding a customer to any non-banking subsidiary or affiliate for marketing purposes without the prior consent of the individual customer concerned.</P>
      <P>However, the insurance industry operates in a free and competitive marketplace and the banks are free to promote the advantages as they see them of doing business with their insurance agents. I wish to achieve an undertaking from the major banks that they will not abuse their dominant positions in banking to interfere unfairly in existing client intermediary arrangements. Failure to achieve such an undertaking will leave me with little option but to consider extending the regulations to cover the excesses of the banks as a whole in this regard </P>

The amended <Col N="1283" /> powers for authorised officers proposed under this Insurance Bill are almost identical to those available to authorised officers who are appointed under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.

      <P>Deputy Perry referred to the inclusion of travel agents and tour operators and Deputy Owen made a similar reference, and possibly Deputy Upton as well. I am currently examining the situation concerning travel agents and tour operators under the 1989 Act. Our officials are consulting with their counterparts in the Department of Public Enterprise which has responsibility for the travel industry. When I was in the Department of Transport, I had political responsibility for that area. I am also examining section 37 of the 1995 Act to which Deputy Owen and Deputy Perry also referred.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton referred to delays in establishing a single regulatory authority. This is of the utmost importance to the Government and it is essential that all the implications of the various options available to the Government for the restructuring of the single regulatory authority are carefully considered before final action is taken. The Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste are currently engaged in consultations with a view to submitting a joint memorandum to the Government on this issue at the earliest opportunity. The priority of the Government will be to ensure that equal weighting is given to consumer interests and prudential supervision. Deputy Upton also insinuated on behalf of Deputy Rabbitte that I delayed making disclosure regulations, but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

It was necessary to prepare new provisions in our insurance legislation to facilitate the making of the disclosure regulations and both the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman indicated in their replies to us that it was quite clear that that would happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Deputy Owen talked about the disclosure of pure protection, policies and she also referred to the Consumers Association of Ireland's submission. I had other submissions from the same organisation earlier which were diametrically different. The submission of the Consumers' Association of Ireland recommended that the Minister should retain the powers in the legislation to require disclosures of pure protection policies in case it should be required at a later stage. The disclosure of pure protection policies will be addressed in the disclosure regulations. It will be undesirable not to retain provision for disclosure of all policies in the primary legislation. Otherwise we would have one hand tied behind our back at all times.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen wants to know who will pay for the regulation. I am pleased that the Minimum Wage Bill has had an immediate impact because it is important that goals we set ourselves are transferred to the workers around the country and that they are receiving the minimum wage. The Central Bank has indicated that it will be in a position to undertake the regulation of insurance intermediaries from within its existing resources. This issue may be addressed again in the context of the single financial regulator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State missed my point. The consumer is paying the minimum wage, not the insurance companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that fully. I understood the Deputy's point clearly. I am delighted it is being passed on very quickly. Deputy Owen also referred to an intermediary unknowingly assisting and churning. The disclosure regulations will be quite specific on churning. This Bill is only providing the enabling provisions. Great care will be taken in drafting the regulations to ensure that an intermediary will not unknowingly break the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen also talked about the powers of authorised officers as opposed to companies legislation &ndash; that was referred to by Deputy Perry. There is no necessity for the powers of authorised officers to be aligned to the powers available under the company law. We are talking about two separate systems of operation. We established our authorised officers very quickly <Col N="1285" /> as a result of churning and within hours we had tremendous information available to us. Within an hour and a half the chief executives of the management team of the relevant company were with me and our team did a wonderful job within 48 hours in getting all the information available because we had no problem in gaining co-operation from the company. Now we have new legislation in position which makes it mandatory on the company to co-operate irrespective of the situation. I am quite confident that matter has been adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to concerns in the insurance industry about the disclosure regulations relating to insurance business. I ask Members not to confuse the legislation we are discussing with the draft regulations which will be required to be effected as disclosure provisions of this Bill.  I ask Members not to confuse the legislation being debated today with the draft regulations which will be required to give effect to the disclosure provisions of this Bill. These draft regulations were made available to interested parties some time ago as part of the consultation process, but I stress that they are not the finished product. It is my responsibility to ensure that the primary legislation before the House is framed in a manner that will empower the Minister of the day to make whatever regulations are considered necessary to provide a practicable level of transparency for all consumers in relation to insurance products which are on the market both now and in the future.</P>
    <P> We have been in consultation on this issue since autumn 1997. I have addressed and met the industry. Nobody is in any doubt as to what we want to achieve, so I do not foresee any major difficulty in ensuring a balance in what is required and in what will be implemented in the interests of the consumer and the industry. Since the Bill was published last December my officials and I have continued to consult the insurance industry, the Central Bank and other interested parties about the content of the Bill. A number of issues have been identified as arising from these consultations which will form the basis for a series of Government amendments I propose to move on Committee Stage. I am satisfied that acceptance of these amendments will benefit the overall quality and effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I record my appreciation of the insurance industry as a whole for the constructive and co-operative manner in which it has approached the development of this Bill. As a group it recognised the need for an improved regulatory regime and recognised other shortcomings in the industry regarding consumer information and protection. As a result of this co-ordinated approach, the legislation will enhance the standing of the insurance industry in the eyes of the public and help to repair a reputation that has been tarnished by a small number of devious operators in recent years. I am confident the standards and obligations imposed by this legislation will not constitute any hardship either for insurance <Col N="1286" /> undertakings or for intermediaries who are committed to the future success of their business and the industry in general.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members for their sincere, detailed, positive and comprehensive contributions. I look forward to working with them on Committee Stage, where we will do our best to have the best legislation in place in the interests of consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I addressed the matter of the treatment of sex offenders before release from prison, as it is crucial we provide the maximum level of treatment for offenders before they are released. I was particularly concerned by the small number of places available to them and also by the small number of prisoners who attend the dedicated treatment programme currently available in Arbour Hill. Only five of the 80 offenders released last year participated in that dedicated programme and this is of particular concern. The Minister must as soon as possible implement the programme which has been promised for the Curragh, which will provide more places for offenders when in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a particular need to investigate seriously why so few sex offenders are found, <Col N="1287" /> when in prison, to be suitable for the programme or volunteer for that programme. I do not raise the matter out of academic interest; there is no doubt that it is terrifying for the victim of a sex crime to know that the perpetrator has been released without receiving appropriate treatment and this is even more traumatic for children. I have received representations &ndash; as have other Members &ndash; from people about perpetrators who have been released from prison and who have been seen in the area where their crimes were committed. This is terrifying for the whole community but for the victim in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that a perpetrator cannot be forced to participate in the dedicated programme in prison, but according to section 29 the courts can require a person, on post-release supervision, to receive psychological counselling or other appropriate treatment programmes run by the probation and welfare services or other bodies. If the courts can require such treatment in a post-release situation, can they not also require people, while in prison, to attend relevant programmes? If this can be done after release I do not see why it cannot be enforced before a person is sentenced. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>We are all obviously trying to minimise the likelihood of people reoffending. We must get across to the public that the best way of doing so is by providing appropriate treatment. That is not being soft on sex offenders but is the best way to protect children, in particular, and other potential victims of sexual abuse and will have to be a major priority. While drafting this legislation did the Minister consult the National Organisation of Treatment of Abusers, which is a network of professionals working with abusers? That body has done a great deal of work in this area and, as professionals, its members would have much information about how we can provide treatment and prevent people from reoffending. As Deputy Neville rightly said, many hard-core paedophiles do not believe they are wrong and are hence the most likely prisoners to refuse treatment and reoffend. It is true that many sex offenders would not particularly want to receive treatment because of their mental attitude. Whatever can be done to persuade or force people to receive treatment has to be done.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about the legislation. It will not be the solution to the problem of sex offenders in our communities. One study estimates that only 10% of offenders are prosecuted, while other studies suggest the figure is lower. The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre states that only 36% of people reporting sexual offences to it reported those offences to the Garda, so we are dealing with a very small percentage of those who have committed such crimes.  Putting them on a register is not the solution to the fears and concerns surrounding this issue. Other research indicates that 70% of offenders are family members. This measure will not be effective in that regard <Col N="1288" /> either. We must be realistic about the extent to which legislation is effective. Nevertheless, the speedy introduction of the legislation is, unfortunately, necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville referred to paedophile rings and the use of the Internet to circulate information and protect people from detection. This also militates against safeguarding the community. We must be constantly vigilant and try to devise new ways in which we can stop this use of the Internet so we can be one step ahead of those who use it for criminal purposes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the part of the Bill which deals with offenders applying for jobs which involve unsupervised contact with children. Under this legislation, they must inform their employer or potential employer of their record. This is extremely important. Will this be effectively policed? Will the funding and relevant staff be provided. The worst offenders are most unlikely to comply with this part of the legislation and say they have been convicted of a sex offence when looking for a job involving contact with children. This measure must be properly policed.</P>
    <P>A large amount of funding will be necessary to implement this Bill. The probation and welfare services will require significant funding and staff to fulfil their obligations under it. I welcome these obligations, particularly those in section 29 which gives them the power to make offenders take part in programmes. Section 29 also enables the courts to make regulations regarding offenders. When the Minister announced the introduction of this Bill, he indicated that it might oblige sex offenders to stay away from schools and other areas where young people congregate. I cannot find a specific reference to this in the Bill but I think section 29 could be used in this regard. Will the Minister clarify this?</P>
    <P>Access to the register is another grey area in the legislation. Will the Minister clarify how this will work? How senior will a Garda have to be to decide who should have access to the register? The term &ldquo;need to know basis&rdquo; is used. There is a lack of clarity regarding what this means and to what extent the register will be available and to whom. There is also a question of balance. We are all concerned that the families of sex offenders do not suffer because of the crimes committed by the offending member of the family. The wording of the Bill is ambiguous in this regard and perhaps the Minister will provide some information on that.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the application of the Bill to persons convicted outside the State? How does one ensure a person convicted outside the State complies with the section which obliges him to inform the authorities within a ten day period that he is temporarily or permanently resident in the State? I presume that the authorities would have that information in the case of those convicted within the State. However, regarding someone convicted outside the State, would information that a person had applied for permission to enter the country be directly given by <Col N="1289" /> other jurisdictions to the Garda? Given our common travel area with Britain, this will cause problems. However, there is a concern that people have and will enter from outside the State, particularly given the introduction of the British register of offenders. It is important that we know that an offender has entered the State. Is it up to the individual to comply with this part of the Bill? If it is, many people will not comply and it will be more difficult to trace people who have come in from outside the State than those who are already resident here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of limited separate legal representation, particularly for rape victims. We, with rape crisis centres have been looking for this for a long time. The provision of separate legal representation is limited and only applies when the sexual history of a victim is raised in the court. In most cases, this information is not allowable in court because it is not relevant to the case. Will the Minister consider the extension of this provision? I know there must be balance and one side cannot be seen to have more representation. However, one of the concerns expressed to us by rape crisis centres and others is that victims should be informed about what is happening, which is often not the case. I read of one case where the victim said, &ldquo;I met the prosecuting barrister at 9 a.m. on the morning of the trial, which is a ridiculous set up; the woman to try and represent five years of my life and 21 years of living with abuse meets me for half an hour.&rdquo;  Frequently, decisions are made about the timing of the case of which the victim is unaware. Victims are reliant on someone on the State's legal team finding the time to inform them.</P>
    <P>Someone, preferably a solicitor or barrister, should be assigned to keep the victims informed of what is going on and to answer any questions they have. Frequently the victims feels they are the least important people in the case and they are often left sitting for hours not knowing what is going on. The victim and the alleged perpetrator must often wait in the same lobby outside a court while waiting for the case to be called or during deliberations. This is difficult for the victim of such a crime. I know the Bill is not intended to focus on this issue to a great extent and the only aspect dealt with is separate legal representation where past sexual history is raised in court. Nevertheless I would like the Minister to consider those aspects also.</P>
    <P>The Bill will help to some extent to allay people's fears that sexual offenders may be allowed to roam free in the community once they have served their sentences. That these obligations exist in legislation gives some support, comfort and protection to society at large. However, the most effective way to deal with sex offenders and protect the community from sex offenders is to use the methods of prevention and treatment and to provide the necessary treatment before the person is released from prison.</P>
    <P>That there is such a small number of places available and such a small number of prisoners <Col N="1290" /> participate in the programmes is a serious cause for concern. The professionals in the area state that young offenders respond well to treatment programmes and there is a real possibility of avoiding recidivism among young offenders if they get the appropriate treatment programmes at an early stage. If all possible provision was made with regard to treating all offenders, particularly these young offenders, before they return to the community, it would surely be a great favour to society. If we can do that, we will have addressed a terrible scourge which puts fear into the hearts of parents in particular. When one considers there are sex offenders in society and that it is possible that treatment would make a difference, we must make every effort to ensure that treatment is made available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of a register, but for it to be effective, it must be adequately financed. The Probation and Welfare Service must be adequately financed in order that there is effective supervision in the community and that what is designed to happen, according to the Bill, will actually happen because if the Bill does not have the desired effect, there is not much point in putting it on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue. We are at the beginning of a new millennium; a new century is dawning. We must re-affirm the commitment to De Valera's Constitution in respect of protecting children and safeguarding their future. If we do not address these fundamentals, everything that has happened since the founding of the State is meaningless. We must protect children and all others who may be at risk.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a package of significant reforms to protect the public against sex offenders. Its main purpose is to make it mandatory for certain convicted sex offenders to ensure that the Garda is notified of their names and addresses. This will ensure that Garda records are kept up-to-date at all times in respect of sex offenders and their current whereabouts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill creates a new civil court order that will enable the Garda to protect the community against the behaviour of sex offenders. It also prohibits sex offenders from seeking employment which would bring them into unsupervised contact with children without advising their employer of their conviction. I ask the Minister to re-visit this area. There should be a corresponding onus on employers not to employ persons, who have informed them that they are sex offenders, in positions in which they will care for vulnerable persons of any age. It should be an offence for employers to do this, just as it will be an offence for the applicant to seek the position without disclosing all the relevant information. We must not forget that there are some unscrupulous employers. This responsibility on employers not to hire those they know to be sex offenders in positions where they would care for vulnerable <Col N="1291" /> people would be a double safeguard for those at risk.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service will be empowered to exercise post-release supervision of sex offenders. The Bill also allows for separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases. This would apply during applications to cross-examine the complainant's past sexual experience. I want to see a broadening of this provision of legal representation for the complainants. It should not be limited only to the area of past sexual experience. The victim should be afforded the same level of representation as the accused, who has the right to legal representation without qualification. I agree that the accused persons should be given the full protection of the law; they are entitled to this. This, however, should not be to the detriment of the victim who has already suffered enough in his or her traumatic experience. Will the Minister reconsider this aspect of the legislation. He and his officials should re-visit it without delay.</P>
    <P>I am worried by another aspect of the Bill. In a case where the offence occurs during the employment of the offender, should the employer be advised? This could be relevant if the offender were employed in a public occupation, for example, as a taxi-driver. Another point which would also need to be addressed is the legal position of the employer if he or she were to act on the information received. Will the State protect the employer against a legal action such as an unfair dismissal action? It should do so.</P>
    <P>Section 3 lists the sexual offences to which the Act will apply. It places emphasis on the offences which relate to children and is intended to protect them against sexual abuse. It also lists certain offences, such as rape and sexual assault, which can be committed against adults and children. It targets the serious offender and child abuser. All of the offences to which I have referred will trigger the notification requirement. I note that there are exceptions, particularly where there is consensual sexual activity between persons between the ages of 15 and 17.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that an offence of sexual assault on a person of 17 years of age or more should be exempted from the notification requirement if the offender is not sentenced to prison. In Part II, the notification requirements are outlined. They define the person to whom they will apply. They also explain the manner in which they will work. It is of the utmost importance that this legislation will be made work. That is why I am pleased to see that those who have committed an offence prior to the enactment of the Act will be bound by the terms of this legislation. This will apply to offenders in prison, in the Central Mental Hospital and to offenders on bail pending appeal. All of those categories will be subject to the notification requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the notification periods. I welcome the minimum five year period for per<Col N="1292" /> sons given a non-custodial sentence or a fully suspended sentence; the seven year period for person convicted and given a custodial sentence of six months or less; the ten year period for those sentenced to between six months and two years; the lifetime notification obligation for those who are sentenced for more than two years; and the 50% reduction in the periods which apply where offenders are under 18 at the time of sentence. Provision is also made for an increase or a reduction in the notification requirement period where a sentence has been varied on appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 9 defines the requirements of the State on the sex offender regarding notification. I note that an offender must, either in person or in writing, notify his or her name and address to a major Garda station within ten days of becoming subject to its terms. The Garda must also be advised of any change of address, whether it be temporary or permanent.</P>
    <P>The authorities must be kept advised of a continued absence outside the State. A person who is subject to the life-time requirements may apply to the Circuit Court for an order discharging him or her from this obligation. It may be done on the grounds that the interests of the common good are no longer served by the applicant continuing to be subject to them. This application may be made after ten years have elapsed from the date of release from prison.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea that persons who have been convicted of sex offences abroad should also be subject to the terms of these qualifying periods.</P>
    <P>Under Part III, provision is made for a new civil court order called a sex offender order. This applies to persons whose behaviour gives cause for concern that they would pose a serious threat of harm to the public. l would agree with this approach because prevention is the best form of action which the authorities can take in this field. The making of a sex offender order will also mean that the person named will go on the register.</P>

This Lenten period we might remember some of our traditions and reflect on the biblical theme of &ldquo;Who is my neighbour&rdquo;; on the 14 million young children and ten million older children and young adults in developing countries who die each year from easily and cheaply preventable malnutrition and disease; the 840 million people in developing countries who are malnourished; the women who represent 70 per cent of all poverty stricken people, followed closely by the elderly, in developing countries; the 79 per cent of the world's population who now live in the Third World; the 2.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation; the more than 90 per cent of the 35 million HIV/AIDS infected people who live in developing countries, the number having doubled between the years 1990 and 1997; the 16 million people living in the Horn of Africa who are now suffering the effects of famine and drought and whose lives are in imminent danger.  We hear much about the global economy. In the global economy these are our neighbours. This morning <Col N="1294" /> in <i>The Irish Times</i> Declan Walsh made the following report:</P>
    <P>A small bundle lies inside a dome-shaped hut made from twigs and dirty socks. There is a small toe sticking from the bottom. A young man pulls back the cloth to reveal his four-year-old daughter, Anab, who died hours earlier. &ldquo;She was losing weight for weeks and couldn't take any food at the end. The only thing was milk and since our animals died, we didn't have any left,&rdquo; says the grief-stricken father, Bishar Sigale, waving flies away from the tiny foot. This is the third child Sigale has lost since arriving at Danan, the town at the heart of the Ethiopian food crisis, four months ago. The family of nine trekked for seven days and arrived with nothing after their donkey collapsed on the way . . . after the failure of rain for the fourth successive year in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia. They have come in search of food and water and found little of either. On average, seven children die every day in Danan &ndash; 300 in the past two months.</P>
    <P>Just a decade ago this region was green and food-wealthy, so much so it could send its sorghum surplus across the country. Now it is a harsh brown terrain of withered trees and dust swirls whipped up by the oven-hot winds.</P>
    <P>The rough roads leading to Danan are littered with a macabre line of rotting cattle, sheep and donkey carcases. Even the camels have started to die.</P>
    <P>This scene from Ethiopia was reported on the front of <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning and is repeated throughout the developing world on a regular basis. We can change things and development aid does work. For example, life expectancy in the Third World increased by more than one-third between 1960 and 1990 and infant mortality rates reduced from 76 to 58 per 1,000 live births. The dreadful facts remain that about 1.5 billion people are not expected to survive to age 60, and 340 million women will die before age 40.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Foreign Policy White Paper stated:</P>
    <P>Ireland's relations with the developing countries form an integral part of our foreign policy. There is a demonstrable interconnection between the economic and social well being of all the nations of the world and the maintenance of international peace and stability. Irish aid and development co-operation are practical expressions of Ireland's foreign policy commitment to peace and justice in the world.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also set the objectives of development aid as follows:</P>
    <P>To reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in some of the poorest countries in the world; to assist in establishing and maintaining peace in developing countries by fostering democracy, respect for human rights, gender and social equality and protection of the environment; to respond promptly to <Col N="1295" /> emergencies and humanitarian disasters, both natural and man-made as they occur, and to support preventive measures so that such emergencies may, so far as possible, be avoided; to contribute to building civil society and social solidarity.</P>
    <P>To these we might add a fairer deal at World Trade Organisation negotiations, and insistence that the EU gets its act together. In an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 2 April this year, Dave Cronin wrote the following:</P>
    <P>Addressing a conference in Amsterdam Poul Nielsson (EU Commissioner) said that the EU commission has just three members of staff allocated to manage each £7 million of development aid under its control, compared to nine in the national administrations of some EU states. He described the objectives of the EU's policies towards the wider world as &ldquo;too numerous, too vague and incoherent&rdquo; leading to &ldquo;very real inconsistencies&rdquo; between them. This is especially so, he said, in terms of the relationship between food aid, trade policy in agricultural products, and fisheries agreements with developing countries.</P>
    <P>Nielsson did not elaborate on the consequences of such bureaucratic befuddlement. But a recent study by Christian Aid and the Dutch aid group Aprodev presents some stark examples, concluding that the EU is flouting the legally binding provisions of the Maastricht Treaty which require that its policies should help eradicate poverty and encourage economic development of long-term benefit to the world's poorest regions.</P>
    <P>More fundamentally, development groups are incensed at how three billion euros £2.34 billion of EU development aid overseen by the Commission each year is not spent within that year, with unused funds being returned to the national treasuries from where they originally came. That amount represents 50% of the total for development aid for which the commission bears responsibility. Eurostep has suggested that it could be allocated to resolving the debts owed by developing countries to EU states.</P>
    <P>In Amsterdam, Nielsson blamed bad decisions taken before he became a Commissioner for the poor implementation of programmes. &ldquo;This has left the new commission with a considerable overhang of unspent resources caught some where in the system between directorate Y and committee X and the unfortunate beneficiary country is left wondering what happened to the aid we promised&rdquo;, he is quoted as saying.</P>
    <P>Why has our Minister with responsibility for development not brought this to the attention of the House? Why has she not led the charge in highlighting this outrage at a time of so much pandemic and holocaust? The House should inquire into these matters through the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European or <Col N="1296" /> Foreign Affairs and I intend to raise the matter there.</P>
    <P>Members are not elected by those who benefit directly from development aid and, therefore, the political pressure will always be to allocate funds to domestic projects, often in response to electoral demands. Peace and justice in the world must become more than a White Paper aspiration. It is as much in our own interests as it is in the interest of the developing world that international peace and security is maintained, as the White Paper stated.</P>
    <P>Despite the introduction of multi-annual financing of the discretionary elements of the Government's development budget, the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for development aid is not ever met. No matter how much, or how earnestly, the Government of the day promises this, when future Ministers for Finance seek savings there will not be Members from developing countries to speak up for the hungry or the dying. The development budget, therefore, will come under pressure again in the future. This issue will not be grasped for as long as it remains within the framework of the traditional Estimates procedure.</P>
    <P>The Government's target of 0.45% of GNP by 2002 should be stated in law, as should an increase of 0.05% for each of the years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, thus meeting our 0.7% commitment in that year. Fine Gael proposed this in a policy document published last year and has won much support for the legislative approach and this motion seeks to achieve this objective. National debt servicing, for example, is met directly from the central fund by legislative authority. This means the Government does not have to come back to the Dáil each year to meet long-term commitments.</P>
    <P>In 2007, 0.7% of GNP could be as much as £600 million and there would still be a domestic budget of £84.4 billion. This breakdown of the allocation of money would still require Dáil approval. Accountability for expenditure of such an amount would be essential and could be enhanced by a new Estimates layout, outlining, for example, amounts allocated to non-governmental organisations and amounts proposed for direct aid to other governments or agencies. The Comptroller and Auditor General would need to report regularly on the effectiveness of such expenditure, including examination of the accounts of those who receive aid. Given that those organisations involved in development work are already funded entirely by public contributions, either from the State or the people, it is time to look at the multiplicity of aid organisations, with replicated administrative and other costs. This needs to be done sensitively.</P>
    <P>The debt crisis is draining developing countries of desperately needed resources. The cost of servicing debt has reversed some human development gains made from the 1950s onwards. In Tanzania, for example, where 40% of people die before the age of 35, debt repayments are six times greater <Col N="1297" /> than health spending. In Africa as a whole, where half of all children do not attend school, governments transfer four times more to northern creditors in debt payments than they spend on health and education. Ireland is not a creditor state, but if we were to meet our UN target we could give leadership to other states to do likewise and carry greater weight in our desire to persuade creditor states to forgive debt. It is easy for us to ask them to do something, it is not as easy for us to do something ourselves but it is time that we did.</P>
    <P>In recent years, Ireland's growth rate has been four times the European average, the fastest growth rate in the OECD. Managing our success has become a challenge. We were in great part given tools with which to do the job through EU transfers and access to the Single Market. Over the coming decade, as we plan the share out of this success we should remember our own sad history and set about giving leadership to the world in giving those in greatest need the tools with which to survive.</P>
    <P>We need to be realistic in approaching this matter and try to do what is practicable. Long after the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself have passed through the House we should be able to look back and say that when we had the resources we grasped the nettle, legislated and gave leadership. If we do that we will meet the 0.7% target and we will be able to ask other countries to forgive debt because we will have made our contribution.</P>
    <P>I refer to two other issues, one of which is the question of human rights and security. When some people, for example, witnessed the scenes in Kosovo, Somalia, and East Timor in more recent times, they said that somebody should do something about it. Ireland sent peacekeeping troops to these countries in difficult times and the Irish Rangers are in quite a dangerous situation in East Timor. However, the same people who referred to the humanitarian crisis and our moral authority in the world often do not face up to the truth in regard to common defence and security policy issues. If security is to be ensured in regions where there is terrible mayhem, it is not a policy to fight to the last Dutch, Belgian, British or American soldier. We must have an ethical policy.</P>
    <P>Law and order in Ireland is a social justice matter. If there is a breakdown, old people, women and children suffer disproportionately. Children cannot be sent to the corner shop to pick up a message for their parents. The same is true of international security because when there is a breakdown the weakest members of society suffer and the bullies survive. We cannot say that we stand for social justice and adopt a hypocritical stance whereby somehow our so-called high moral ground neutrality will influence somebody somewhere to do something about it. There is a changing vista in the EU. It is time that there was more honest debate about it in Ireland and it is also time that we participated in the structures which ensure that there is stability and security and that humanitarian aid can get through. These <Col N="1298" /> are vital elements of any policy if we are truly concerned about the plight of our neighbours.</P>
    <P>It is crucially important that considerable effort and resources are concentrated on education and development issues. We will not be able to spend the money we want to on development aid if we do not bring people with us. Every Member is already aware of the questions asked about immigrants in the community, such as &ldquo;why are they getting this or that?&rdquo;. It will only take a short step before people ask why are we spending money on these people. If we take the time to educate the public, particularly the younger members, to bring them with us, they will, through their sense of justice, be the strongest advocates of meeting our UN commitments.</P>
    <P>Many NGOs have raised with me the need for greater support for the vital development education work which is taking place throughout Ireland. Quality development education for both children and adults in Ireland should be a priority. If we are to take our share of responsibility in relation to development issues, public opinion which is informed and concerned will be needed. According to submissions made to me by NGOs, when asked how they could most effectively help the people in the Third World, 52% of young people in a survey said it would be helpful to educate people here to change things and an additional 38% of those surveyed said it would be of some help; those figures are from a justice and development issues awareness and attitudes survey carried out by DEFY.</P>
    <P>Development education in Ireland has made tremendous progress over the past five years. This is evident, for example, in the proliferation and quality of groups and projects throughout the island in both the formal and non-formal sectors of education, the growing official recognition and promotion of development education at Government and non-governmental levels, the local and community groups which now make links between local and global justice and human rights issues and, importantly, in the heightened level of awareness and informed debate in the media and in Irish civil society overall.</P>
    <P>An educated public is essential to ensuring support for an expanding Irish aid programme and development education has a primary role in ensuring such support. This issue has been raised with Fine Gael by a number of NGOs. They have recommended that funding for development education should be increased to 5% of the bilateral aid programme in a staged series of increases with an interim target of 3% to be allocated by 2002.</P>
    <P>While Irish bilateral aid has increased, the share to development education has remained fairly stagnant since 1995. Between 1995 and 1997, development education's actual share of the bilateral aid budget decreased from 1.1% to 0.8%. We must ensure that trend is not only arrested but that it is reversed.</P>
    <P>There are no votes inside or outside this House for the motion before us tonight. It is not about party politics. It is not about one-upmanship. This <Col N="1299" /> is about concern. I started by saying we are in a Lenten period. I happen to believe that there is still a large number of people who believe in the old traditions, for example, of alms giving during Lent. The Minister could make a significant contribution to a change in foreign policy &ndash; I said that to him on the first day of his appointment. If anybody can do it, he can. I ask him to legislate for this. We will support the legislation. We will not make a party political issue out of it. We will not embarrass him. The situation is grave and it is such a holocaust and a pandemia that we have to take those special steps.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, before this debate concludes tomorrow night, if he is not in a position to say so now, to take on board this proposal to legislate. We will never meet that 0.7% unless we do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available to me I want to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, on tabling the motion, on his opening statement and on his fine document concerning our neighbours that he produced on behalf of Fine Gael some time last year. That document should be read by Deputies on all sides of the House. I am aware it has been extensively read and welcomed by groups and individuals outside the House.</P>
      <P>It is utterly unacceptable that millions of people in the developing world will starve to death while we in Ireland enjoy the fruits of the Celtic tiger. That was briefly referred to by Deputy Mitchell when he mentioned the question of refugees and asylum seekers. I admit to being appalled at the level of criticism and racism apparent in this country in the context of the refugee and immigration issue. Suggestions that certain communities outside Dublin might host asylum seekers have resulted in a shocking wave of criticism and intolerance that surely flies in the face of Ireland of the welcomes. I have heard nothing less than unadulterated xenophobia in recent times, so much so that I would remind people of the existence of the Incitement to Hatred Act. That Act should be dusted down in many of our Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>There is a firm duty on civil and Church leaders to lead and mould public opinion on the matter of asylum seekers. Many of these people are in a difficult and frightening position. As refugees they have suffered, and being strangers in some of our towns is, unfortunately, not a pleasant experience. With the approach of the Christian festival of Easter, the words of Christ &ndash; a gentleman I have never quoted in the House before &ndash; are apt: &ldquo;I was a stranger and you welcomed me&rdquo;. That is appropriate having regard to the immigration and refugee challenge currently facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the motion, I am concerned at the continued manipulation by the IMF which loaned vast sums of money to the poorest countries at supposedly low interest rates. In return for this <Col N="1300" /> borrowing, these countries must implement the most harsh of economic policies managed and controlled by the IMF. This results in swingeing economic cuts, devastation of local services at the most basic level, drops in primary school enrolment, rising malnutrition, swift removal of trade barriers resulting in the collapse of local industry and cuts in public employment giving rise to thousands of job losses in countries where there is no alternative employment available. Since the IMF is not considered a development bank, its role is short-term stabilisation rather than having any long-term view. It has far too much power in proportion to its expertise and, in effect, it usurps the role of directly elected governments.</P>
    <P>Vital resources are being drained from developing countries by the high level of international debt. I visited Tanzania a few years ago and experienced at first hand the positive fruits of Ireland's development aid. I saw the valuable work of the ESB personnel from my own constituency who embarked on a most worthwhile programme of rural electrification. The other side of the same coin in Tanzania is the strangulation by debt. A total of 40% of the people in Tanzania die before they reach the age of 35. Debt payments in Tanzania are six times more than the amount available for spending on health.</P>
    <P>For many years, Trócaire highlighted the adverse impact on human rights of institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank. While the highly indebted poor countries' world debt initiative, which is to be welcomed, has proved beneficial, it represents a mere tip of the iceberg. It is clear that many developing countries are buckling under the sheer weight of international debt obligations. They cannot become released from this huge burden. We are not calling for the entire debt to be written off throughout Africa but we need a European co-ordinated policy. I hope the Minister will give a lead in ensuring that there is a viable and respected policy from the European Union in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion on this particular issue. I congratulate Deputy Mitchell who brought the motion before the House. He is a man who has great passion for his portfolio. He produced a document of which we are all very proud and he has been consistent on this whole issue over the years. At times I do not agree with him on many issues &ndash; I agree with him on others &ndash; but on this issue he has my full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan surprised me with his quotation. I am amazed by the length of time it takes Governments to react, particularly when nightly news reports show young mothers in camps with their children dying in their arms. Why does it take Governments so long to respond? If a war was taking place and the world's oil supply and economic well-being were at stake, those Governments would act promptly. It is terrible that we live in a two tier society. In one part of the world people are dying from overeating while in the <Col N="1301" /> other part people are dying of starvation. In Europe, the EU is paying farmers to store food or place it in intervention while people are dying in other parts of the world. That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Governments &ndash; I include our Government in this but I refer particularly to its American and British counterparts &ndash; spend millions of pounds each day on armaments for their military forces. That money should be spent on helping those who need it. We have entered the new millennium and it makes no sense that young mothers and their children should be starving while our Governments fail to respond. If wars are taking place in the countries affected by famine, nations with well equipped armies should deal with Governments which are stopping people transporting food into areas where people need it. Armies should be used to ensure that these young mothers and children are prevented from dying.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to compliment nuns and priests for the work they have done in this area over the years. Priests have come in for a great deal of bad press in this country in respect of certain matters which occurred in the past. However, priests, nuns and lay people have travelled to countries in need, identified and dealt with the problems they encountered but they have never received the credit they deserve. I wish to place on record the thanks of the Irish people to those who went abroad to help others. In some instances, these people have died for what they believed in.</P>
    <P>Another person to whom I wish to refer &ndash; I heard him interviewed on radio today &ndash; is John O'Shea, a man who is very passionate about his job. I compliment Mr. O'Shea who has travelled abroad to countries in need and, with those employed by his organisation, identified many problems. As Deputy Gay Mitchell stated earlier, the people in these countries have no one to represent them and it is left to John O'Shea and others to do so. I congratulate John O'Shea, our priests, nuns and lay people who have given of their time for this good cause.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a plea to young doctors and nurses who are about to obtain their qualifications and embark on their careers. Perhaps some of these people might consider devoting six months or one year of their lives to helping those in need in other countries and giving them the care and love they require. I make my plea to those who, later in life, will have ample opportunity to embark on their careers. I ask them to give of their time to helping people in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell inquired about those who suffer when events of this kind take place. One need only look at media reports to realise that women are the greatest sufferers. Women are always the ones who suffer.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to respond favourably to this motion. Irish people are always very generous when asked to respond to requests for charitable donations. In my local church in West<Col N="1302" /> port last weekend, over £4,000 was collected. If the people respond, the Government should also respond. If it does not do so tonight, I hope it responds positively to the motion tomorrow evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this emotive issue. I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell on his well researched presentation. The Deputy prefaced his remarks by asking &ldquo;Who is my neighbour?&rdquo;  In my catechism my neighbour was all mankind, even those who injure or offend us. The poor people of Mozambique or the eastern region of Ethiopia never offended or injured us, but they should be offended by the Government's response to their terrible plight.</P>
      <P>The recent floods in Mozambique and the drought in Ethiopia are the result of excessive rain in one country and a complete lack of it in the other. Everyone has seen television reports of flood waters devastating homes, towns and villages in Mozambique. Rich farmland has been washed away, starvation is rife and there are rotting corpses everywhere. In Ethiopia, the drought has lasted four years. The countryside is barren, cattle are dying and everything necessary for human survival is simply vanishing off the face of the earth. The UN's contribution to alleviating the crisis there is to supply 4.5 kilogrammes of rice per person per month.</P>
      <P>What has been the Government's contribution and is it aware of the plight of these countries? Its members should hang their heads in shame. The Exchequer returns for the first three months of the year show a surplus of £1 billion. Did the Government, when it received this good news, state that we are doing so well we should help poorer nations? All we heard in respect of making a contribution was silence. However, the Government has gloated about how well the country is doing. Of course we should rejoice at our good fortune, but we should also remember those who are less fortunate.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago I took up a church gate collection in my village, Butler's Bridge, which is home to a small rural community, for the Mozambique flood disaster fund. I was overwhelmed by the response of ordinary decent people who freely placed £5 notes on the table. However, I was struck by the fact that parents placed coins in their children's hands and encouraged them to place the money on the table. That is the right way to raise children. Butler's Bridge is no different from any other parish in County Cavan or elsewhere throughout the country. The people have responded and are leading the way. The Government has failed us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to represent the country properly. The people want the Government to respond to the devastation caused by these terrible natural disasters in Africa. The famines afflicting Mozambique and Ethiopia were not caused by war, they are the result of natural disaster. The Government should be loud in its call <Col N="1303" /> to the superpowers to cancel these unfortunate countries' debts. It is not that they want to run away from their debts but natural disasters have wiped out their means of survival. They will recover in time and if we take action to help them I am sure we would be happy if they responded in kind in years to come. Such debts are never forgotten.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Ring in paying tribute to the members of religious orders &ndash; nuns and priests &ndash; and lay missionaries who have travelled to Africa to offer their help. I acknowledge the work of people who are well off and who devote their holiday time to working in poor countries. There are great people in this country, people who are prepared to make that sacrifice and to reinvest a little of what they have obtained. However, the Government has failed the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to represent the people. I have no doubt that the people in his constituency are no different from those who live in counties Cavan or Monaghan and they will give him the same message. The people want the Government to play its part. We have the leading economy in Europe, a fact of which we can be proud, but we must also take the lead in terms of the contribution we make. We must set an example for other member states and encourage them to make a contribution. If the Government takes such action it will enjoy the support of the people. As Deputy Mitchell stated, this motion was not tabled to gain votes, it was tabled because we have a duty to help those who are less well off in countries which are ravaged by famine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledges the progress made by successive Governments in increasing the resources for development aid;</P>
      <P>&ndash;commends the response of the Government to the crisis in Ethiopia and the recent emergency in Mozambique; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;approves the approach of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in carrying out a review of the aid programme, the outcome of which will include a commitment to reaching the UN target for aid allocations of 0.7 per cent of GNP within a specific time frame while maintaining the aid programme's reputation for quality aid and effective management.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted we are discussing this subject in my first debate as Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is a most important aspect of our deliberations in the Department. It is especially apt at this time of crisis in Ethiopia that the House should debate not only the issue of emergency aid but the aid <Col N="1304" /> programme as a whole. The interest shown through the debate is a reflection of the compassion of the Irish people for those facing disaster and famine and of the public support for tackling the poverty of developing countries. Although we may occasionally differ in emphasis, it is important to acknowledge that there is a political concord across the political spectrum in support of a strong programme of development assistance.</P>
    <P>First I will address the crisis in Ethiopia. The recent humanitarian emergency in Mozambique and the looming crisis in the Horn of Africa once again focus our attention on the terrible poverty suffered by the people on that continent. That poverty reduces their ability to cope with the effects of drought, floods and other natural disasters. It leaves roads unpaved, wells undug and vaccinations unavailable. It is exacerbated by conflicts and massive displacement of people. While we must respond generously to humanitarian emergencies, we must at the same time work towards long-term solutions. We must empower countries to prevent or at least mitigate the worst effects of these adverse climatic conditions. We must work with the rest of the international community to improve early warning systems and to put in place effective national disaster response mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Ireland responded quickly and effectively to the terrible aftermath of the flooding in Mozambique. The embassy in Maputo got directly involved in the response. Emergency assistance was provided through our aid programme, Irish NGOs and through the United Nation's humanitarian agencies. We continue to provide emergency and rehabilitation support. We are committed to working with the Government and people of Mozambique towards the only viable solution which is long-term sustainable development which incorporates emergency preparedness and mitigation policies and mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Attention has now shifted to the Horn of Africa where up to eight million people in Ethiopia and a further six million in the Horn of Africa are potentially at serious risk if the next rains, due in June, fail and if food is not prepositioned for such an eventuality. Three years of drought and the failure of the most recent rains have left crops withering in the fields and thousands of animals dead for lack of water. A sign of the seriousness of the situation is the death of the most vulnerable people, very young children and the elderly. At present between 60,000 and 100,000 people are severely malnourished. The latest information we have from our embassy in Addis Ababa is that help is arriving and more is on its way from the Government of Ethiopia, the UN World Food Programme, the major donors and the international NGOs.</P>
    <P>There is still time to avert the present terrible situation from developing into a major disaster. Over 800,000 tonnes of food aid has been pledged by the EU, US and other donors. This is considered sufficient for the needs which are likely <Col N="1305" /> to arise this year. Obviously needs assessments are being carried out constantly and the needs revised as more reliable information becomes available. There are problems with the capacity of the available ports, the state of the roads and available land transport. The international community and the Government of Ethiopia are working to improve logistics.</P>
    <P>The World Food Programme is helping increase the capacity of the port at Djibouti which is the main access point. The port in Berbera, Somalia, is also being used. The donors are working together so that these facilities are used as efficiently as possible. By the end of April, 46,500 tonnes of EU food aid will have arrived in Ethiopia for distribution by the NGOs and the World Food Programme. The EU is also looking at airlifting supplementary food for the most vulnerable children in the worst affected region of Ogaden. The World Food Programme has airlifted food this week to an area, south of Gode, where about 9,000 people have gathered in a makeshift camp.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to preposition basic supplies in the more remote areas before the main rains of June and July, assuming they come. These rains will make transportation even more difficult if not impossible.</P>
    <P>We have been following the deteriorating situation for a number of months and have not waited to be prompted by pictures on TV to respond. Ireland Aid has been allocating humanitarian resources consistently throughout 1999 and early this year to a number of these so-called &ldquo;silent emergencies&rdquo; in the Horn and other parts of Africa, including Somalia, Sudan, Burundi, Angola and Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>A team from Ireland Aid recently travelled widely in Ethiopia, which is one of Ireland's priority countries, and saw for themselves the effects of the drought. Since last December, we have provided £359,000 in emergency assistance to Ethiopia through Concern and the World Food Programme. The embassy in Ethiopia is finalising, in consultation with the local and regional authorities, proposals for the reorientation of substantial programme assistance towards alleviating the suffering of the people. We will also continue to work with the Irish NGOs who have international standing and who are in a position to respond rapidly and effectively to the suffering of the Ethiopian people. Our embassy in Addis Ababa will, of course, continue to do all it can to facilitate the Irish NGOs in their work, as it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have also been working during the last months and weeks to raise awareness of the pending crisis at EU and UN humanitarian fora. Yesterday at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, I pressed for early and appropriate action by the EU. I also stressed the urgency of an immediate response in bilateral conversations with Commissioner Patten. The Council called upon Ethiopia and Eritrea to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian <Col N="1306" /> assistance and to ensure its security. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, raised the issue with Commissioner Nielson who assured her that sufficient food aid had been pledged and was on its way. He added that the European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; and the food aid unit of the development directorate had missions in Ethiopia. They would formulate joint conclusions and recommendations for further action.</P>
    <P>Ethiopia is one of Ireland's six priority countries for development assistance in Africa and we have been working over a number of years to help prevent and mitigate disasters in this country of chronic food deficits. Indeed, the decision to commence a programme in that country in 1994 was taken in the context of a logical follow through from the substantial emergency assistance provided by Ireland during the disastrous mid-1980s famine. Our approach at that time, and it is still the case, was to provide maximum assistance in a crisis, followed by a concentration on getting viable long-term development under way again. Successful programmes have been developed in consultation with the Ethiopian authorities and communities in the area of food security and land and water management.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention a couple of salient examples of the type of approach which is currently paying dividends and which is likely to prove viable in the future. In the lowlands of Sidama in the southern region, an area which unusually is being affected by severe drought, improved water conservation ponds developed by Ireland Aid are now proving their worth. In some cases they are the only source of water for the people and their farm animals.</P>
    <P>In Tigre in the north-east, a necessarily more complex and wide ranging approach is being taken to the question of land degradation and drought. An integrated water management programme involves a series of linked interventions ranging from building dams to replenishing native trees and shrubs in order to prevent soil erosion. These also help provide a constant source of water with guaranteed fodder for cattle during the dry season. There is already evidence that these measures have an effect. There is a greater availability and diversity of food sources for the people. This year about £3 million, or approximately 20% of the annual Ireland Aid budget for Ethiopia, is devoted to long-term food security programmes.</P>
    <P>Our programme in Ethiopia is operated collaboratively with Ethiopian authorities and communities and is informed by the spirit of partnership. All funding is applied directly to human development priorities such as food security, primary health care and basic education and there is rigorous auditing of all expenditure. In the light of the current emergency, we will adopt a highly flexible approach in collaboration with our Ethiopian partners with a view to redirecting some programme resources to the emergency response <Col N="1307" /> while continuing to maintain our focus on long-term development.</P>
    <P>The eradication of poverty is the key to preventing loss of life and devastation caused by natural disasters. This can only be achieved through policies and programmes which focus on long-term sustainable development. Given the predictions of continued adverse climatic conditions, we will need to work even harder to build disaster prevention and mitigation into our long-term development programmes. The empowerment of countries in this way to better cope with natural disasters will help to save countless lives in the future.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. In Cairo last week during the Africa-Europe Summit, intense diplomatic efforts continued in a bid to bring an end to the long running war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The conflict between these two countries centres on a border area where jurisdiction has been disputed since before Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia in 1993 and is reported to have cost over 30,000 lives.</P>
    <P>In July 1999, a framework agreement brokered by the Organisation of African Unity at its summit in Algiers was accepted by both governments. A <i>de facto</i> interruption of hostilities is in place and it is clear that there is a desire for peace in both countries as well as the political will to bring the conflict to an end. Unfortunately, however, implementation of the Algiers agreement has been delayed by differences between the two sides on the interpretation of the technical arrangements. Efforts continue to resolve these differences.</P>
    <P>We know from our experience in Northern Ireland how difficult it is to achieve lasting peace where deep divisions exist and how hard it is to agree the sequencing of the technical provisions of a peace agreement. We must continue to offer encouragement and reassurances to the parties. Sanctions and threats are not the way forward. It would be counterproductive for Western donors to dictate conditions for Ethiopia and Eritrea while they are actively seeking peace. What is required is motivation and support rather than prescription. At all costs, a return to violence must be avoided.</P>
    <P>OAU efforts to resolve the conflict have been actively supported by the European Union, the United Nations and the United States. In November 1999, the EU appointed Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Senator Rino Serri as its special representative to support the peace process in the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict. Senator Serri has paid a number of visits to the region, and in Cairo this week was deeply engaged with OAU chairman, President Bouteflika of Algeria and the countries concerned in the ongoing attempts to move the peace process forward. The General Affairs Council considered the current situation yesterday, when Ministers were briefed by Senator Serri.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The EU is actively committed to assist in implementation of the peace agreement as soon as this is possible. The General Affairs Council reaffirmed its strong support for the efforts of the OAU Presidency to bring a speedy end to the conflict and invited its competent bodies to consider the possibility of EU support for the implementation of the peace settlement. It also expressed its concern at the level of arms sales to the region, all the more so given the present humanitarian situation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the conflict has exacerbated food shortages in Ethiopia, not least by absorbing resources which could otherwise have been available for development, and has added to the logistical difficulties in delivering food to those who need it. It is, therefore, crucial that the two governments work to secure a durable peace without any further delay. From what I have said, Deputies will gather that the Government is deeply committed to promoting the well-being of Ethiopia &ndash; we are in Ethiopia for the long haul, providing support in the bad days, and working in the long-term for real, sustainable development.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the public support for a strong development programme. In the context of the Irish programme, strong is the appropriate adjective. By its focus on capacity building and partnerships, by its adherence to the best practices in aid policy, above all by the judgment of its peers, the Irish programme is strong and in the words of the OECD has a &ldquo;reputation for quality aid&rdquo;. While aid includes responding compassionately to emergencies like that which is occurring in Ethiopia, it is also especially about addressing long-term development needs, the steady building of the capacity which enables poorer countries to help themselves, and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The Irish programme is strong in policy, strong in implementation and is an integral part of foreign policy. It is a good reflection of current international policy orientations aimed at eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development through a focus on partnerships. It draws on contacts established in developing countries by our missionaries and NGOs.</P>
    <P>The components of the Irish programme testify to this concentration on long-term development. The bilateral programme focuses on just six countries in southern and eastern Africa where Ireland Aid is a significant player in helping them to develop all aspects of their social and economic infrastructure, playing a role not unlike that which the EU played in our development. Our multilateral aid assists agencies which play leading roles in development, agencies which deal with children, refugees, AIDS and other health issues, human rights, mine clearance, environmental degradation and women's issues. We have a growing programme of debt relief and, not least, we have a strong programme of assistance through NGOs, who have developed outstanding international reputations and high profiles at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> That issue of quality aid, to which the OECD referred, is vital. Any current or former aid worker will say that Africa is pitted with the relics of failed aid projects, evidence of western ideas imposed on developing countries without reference to local consideration of need. The Irish programme is not just focused on quality &ndash; it is seen to be so. Last year the programme was reviewed by its peer donors in the OECD. The review found that Ireland sets high standards for aid; that we have demonstrated that aid can work; that we have an undeviating focus on poverty reduction; and that we are a strong performer in putting partnerships in place.</P>
    <P>This quality aid, which is at the heart of the Irish programme and to which the OECD peer review is testament, took years of patient work to build. A real, working partnership with a developing country begins with building an understanding of its people's reality and with getting beneath the skin of the daily challenges. A social worker in Dublin or an aid worker in Africa will tell of the slow, patient work needed to get beyond the barriers of low self-esteem, common in any environment of poverty. It is also slow work to break down the assumption that outside know-how is better, and to get to a common and real understanding of needs, to get to that tentative beginning of genuine partnership. An authoritative international aid expert addressing a forum in Dublin a few months ago, summed up his caution regarding quick aid with the tongue-in-cheek quip &ldquo;Don't just do something, stand there!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ireland makes no grandiose claims to have cornered the market on quality aid. While the peer review by the Development Assistance Committee, DAC, of the OECD was a welcome plaudit for hard work, it was for past hard work. Maintaining a reputation of quality requires more of the same patient work, more of the steady build-up to a common understanding on which the partnership process is built. What is more, we have to continue to build up our own management capacities to ensure continuing quality, effectiveness and accountability.</P>
    <P>What all of this leads to, in the context of a growing programme, is that a balance must be struck between the requirements of quality and chasing a moving target, in the context of the UN target on allocations. Quality aid requires planned, prudent growth in aid involvement and in management capacity. These are the important issues &ndash; aid properly targeted and managed will have good, lasting impact on the lives and livelihoods of poor people in developing countries. We must not allow an exclusive focus on targets to dilute the quality of the programme or to divert us towards a cheque writing approach to aid.</P>
    <P>To begin the process of striking the balance I mentioned, the Government initiated a broad ranging review of the aid programme which addresses two key questions in the context of growth &ndash; how to grow and how to manage that growth, two questions specifically raised by the <Col N="1310" /> DAC review. In addressing the question of how to grow, the following options for future expansion are being looked at: intensifying existing priority country programmes; launching a new priority country programme; starting different types of activities in the bilateral programme; increasing funding to NGOs and special funds and expanding contributions to multilateral agencies. The considerations to be taken into account in looking at these options are well laid out in the DAC review. I commend it to Deputies with an interest in aid. Apart from these considerations, it is heartening to read how well the Irish programme rates.</P>
    <P>In looking at the related issue, how to manage growth, the review of the OECD committee has some cautionary comments. It points out that growth which is too rapid or too erratic can be destabilising and can jeopardise quality, effectiveness and the value of the programme. It suggests that a clear growth path be established for the programme. The cautionary comments cover the programme management also, which the DAC sees as stretched, dependent on a few key individuals and thus highly vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Against that background, I will outline for completeness the policy principles and the strategic guidelines which inform our approach. The overarching goal of the official aid programme is to reduce poverty in developing countries. This is in line with international commitments and best practice including, for example, the undertaking by donor countries at the Copenhagen social summit in 1995 to devote at least 20% of aid funds to the basic social sectors, that is, primary education and basic health care. The OECD donor countries have also adopted a set of targets aimed at meeting specific poverty-related goals, such as reducing by two-thirds, infant mortality rates between 1990 and 2015.</P>
    <P>With regard to strategy, consistent with the approach taken to EU structural support to Ireland, development aid is seen as a structural intervention to support self-sustaining development within poor countries. The aim is not to alleviate the symptoms of underdevelopment, but rather to contribute to the medium and long-term solution of the underlying problems. The focus, therefore, is on economic growth as well as on the distribution and consumption of resources. There is recognition of the importance of good governance, inclusive political processes and human rights for development. Development encompasses not only material well being but the ability of poor people to assert their rights.</P>
    <P>Aid is seen as supporting but not as replacing initiatives taken by developing countries. The aim is not to do things for developing countries but rather to support their efforts to do things for themselves. Accordingly, assistance is provided for activities that are integrated in local policy and administrative processes and that are sustainable in local circumstances. The aid relationship is seen as a partnership built on mutual respect and parity of esteem. It is vitally <Col N="1311" /> important that the authorities of developing countries should not be seen as less than equal partners. They should instead have a sense of ownership of aid-supported activities and the people who are intended to benefit should have an opportunity to participate in the process.</P>
    <P>Aid can be most effective where there is a supportive policy environment and reasonable standards of public administration. In political terms, the requirement is for systems of government which facilitate broad participation in the development process. In economic terms, experience has demonstrated the value of liberal policies which can set free the potential of individuals and communities. Where the ideal conditions for aid effectiveness are not met, aid can nevertheless be useful, provided there is a commitment, which it can assist, to bringing about the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Irish aid is distributed through three main channels: First, direct development partnerships with a limited number of individual priority countries, second, aid through multilateral organisations such as the EU, the World Bank and the UN, and, third, aid distributed through NGOs and other partner organisations for both smaller long-term development projects and for emergency responses. This approach is seen as providing the optimum means of responding to the diverse needs of developing countries.</P>
    <P>The mix of activities supported also responds to the diverse needs of developing countries. Support is provided for debt relief and other forms of programme aid: sectoral programmes, especially in health and education; multi-sectoral programmes focused on particular local government districts; measures to develop administrative and institutional capacity; humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance; measures to support human rights and democratic development; support in the form of project by project funding and, increasingly, block grants for activities implemented by NGOs; volunteer assignments by Irish people; and development education in Ireland, as stated by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is recognition of the value of maintaining a disciplined focus on a limited range of activities. The programme should be known for high levels of professionalism and effectiveness in a limited number of areas rather than a poor quality response across an excessively broad range of activities. We have seen a huge increase in the allocation from £40 million in 1992 to £190 million this year.</P>
    <P>As regards meeting the target, there have been changes in the definition of GNP. However, the important point is that the circumstances relating to our levels of economic growth and the need to meet these percentage targets under the criteria should not mask the reality, which is that our aid budget is one of the fastest growing in the world. Deputies should not believe that the Government has abandoned the goal of reaching 0.7% of <Col N="1312" /> GNP. On the contrary, at a time when we have joined the ranks of wealthy nations, we are more concerned than ever to ensure that the aid programme should not stall or diminish as a proportion of our national wealth. I am confident that what will emerge from the review is a charter for the future growth of the programme. This will establish an orderly growth path for the programme, maintaining its focused nature and its reputation for effectiveness in sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The NGOs are a valuable means of channelling aid for poverty reduction in line with the overall focus of the Ireland Aid programme. Irish NGOs, including our missionary orders, have a strong tradition and considerable experience of working with the poorest of the poor in developing countries. The Government has recognised, in developing a partnership with NGOs over the years, that they have strengths which can contribute to its overall strategies, particularly their ability to work directly with the poorest of the poor. Trócaire, Concern, GOAL and others, as well as our missionary sisters and priests, have demonstrated their commitment to the very poorest, whether in the barrios of Argentina, working with street children in Ethiopia or developing urban and rural communities in Africa. NGOs can often support projects at local level which it is more difficult for public aid to do.</P>
    <P>The partnership between Ireland Aid and NGOs, therefore, recognises the close contacts which many NGOs have with local communities and the potential this creates for reaching the poor, giving them a voice and building their capacity to be involved in and to determine their own development. In 1998, for example, a total of £20.7 million or roughly 15% of total ODA was channelled through our NGO system.</P>
    <P>In a situation of increased funding for the overall programme, the role of NGOs can and should be strengthened. I am prepared to see enhanced funding being channelled through NGOs. However, I would like to see this combined with a more strategic approach to the way aid is delivered through development programmes co-financed with our NGOs and with increased focus being given to outcomes and impact. The DAC review of the Ireland Aid programme last year noted that direct support for NGO activities and support through NGOs already absorbs a relatively large share of the Government's aid spending. It also pointed to the balance which needs to be struck between increases in funding and the maintenance of quality, something which I am sure the NGOs would endorse.</P>
    <P>We are considering the introduction of multi-annual funding for our larger NGOs which are already in receipt of block grant funding. This would facilitate them in better planning of their development activities and provide a greater measure of assurance regarding funding levels. In turn, this should allow NGOs to strengthen their relationships with their local NGO partners in developing countries. As part of this, we are <Col N="1313" /> reviewing our existing block grant provisions to see where criteria may need to be revised or strengthened to continue to ensure that funding is consistent with agreed priorities, that public funds continue to be adequately accounted for and that aid continues to be effective and efficient. There needs to be greater public ownership of our aid efforts and, therefore, a partnership with NGOs and a collective endeavour involving not just the State but the various strands of civil society.</P>
    <P>The pandemic of AIDS mentioned in the Fine Gael motion is a huge issue with 34 million people living with the HIV virus and, among them, those who have gone on to develop AIDS. Over 95% of the infected individuals live in developing countries, and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region of the world. We see the pandemic as a major threat to development progress in all Ireland Aid's priority countries. As a result of his African visit, the Taoiseach has brought this matter to the attention of the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, to urge a revitalisation of the EU's activities in the fight against AIDS. The Taoiseach also called for greater collective action, a more co-ordinated approach at EU level and greater action to assist developing countries to obtain the drugs needed for AIDS patients in developing countries. The reply from the President of the Commission has been encouraging. At Ireland's instigation the Portuguese Presidency of the EU has placed the AIDS issue on the agenda of the Development Council on 18 May. This will be a useful opportunity to promote the need for greater EU co-ordination and to review the level of resources devoted both by the Commission and member states to AIDS programmes.</P>
    <P>We have also seen the need for improved governance and adherence to democracy and human rights as a critical feature of the criteria we use for our development aid moneys and that is only right in terms of maintaining an ethical basis to our decisions, as Deputy Mitchell said. Our bilateral programme has a specific thematic and geographic focus. That focus is on the least developed countries and on six such countries in Africa, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia and Mozambique. They all rank low in terms of human development indicators, including the percentage living in absolute poverty and also in terms of life expectancy, adult literacy, infant mortality, access to safe water, sanitation and health services. In these countries the thrust of the programme is on basic needs, rural development, education and health and a framework of democracy and good governance. Most aid in the priority countries is delivered in the form of integrated programmes at regional or local level. The principles that guide this bilateral involvement are the three Ps, poverty, participation and partnership. The overriding focus is poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>The huge debt burden on poor developing countries is recognised as a major constraint to their development. It is impossible, from a <Col N="1314" /> development perspective, to accept a situation in which poor countries face unsustainable debt burdens when they also have to confront natural disasters, famine, conflict and a HIV-AIDS pandemic. Debt service payments exceed health and education budgets in a number of poor countries. For our part, we have never given development assistance in the form of credits. We are not owed money by developing country governments. Although we are not a creditor, we have allocated £31.5 million to debt relief, including £22 million in contributions to the debt relief activities of the World Bank and the IMF. The remainder is going to help service the debts of priority countries such as Mozambique and Tanzania. In future all countries eligible to receive debt relief will prepare poverty reduction strategy papers in close collaboration with the World Bank, IMF and other key donors. This approach is in line with Irish Government policy which, throughout the review of the HIPC, called for the strengthening of the link between poverty reduction and debt relief.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Convention between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states was agreed during our Presidency of the EU in 1975. The convention has been an outstanding mechanism, providing over 22 billion euros between 1986 and 1998 in development assistance to the ACP countries, with most of these funds going to the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We have made our contribution in that respect as members of the European Union. Ireland Aid has been strongly supportive of efforts at the Development Assistance Committee at the OECD to forge an agreement between donors on the untying of official development assistance to least developed countries. This would be an essential first step in a process which should lead to the untying of development assistance to all developing countries.</P>
    <P>At the end of March the UN Secretary General presented a report, We the Peoples: The Role of the UN in the Twenty First Century, which will form the basis of the discussions at the UN millennium summit of Heads of State and Government at the UN in September. The report in the words of Mr. Annan is &ldquo;hugely ambitious&rdquo;. It sets out the key issues facing the world in the new millennium and proposes a series of initiatives designed to overcome these challenges.</P>
    <P>A major section of the report focuses on &ldquo;freedom from want&rdquo;. The report says that &ldquo;we must spare no effort to free our fellow men and women from abject and dehumanising poverty&rdquo; and calls on the international community to halve by the year 2015 the proportion of the world's people, currently 22%, who live on less than one dollar per day, to halve by the same date the proportion of people, currently 20%, who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water and to ensure that by 2015 all children everywhere will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> The UN Secretary General calls on the more fortunate countries to grant duty and quota free access to their markets for essentially all products coming from least developed countries. He also seeks an expansion of the current international debt relief programme and demands greater international action in the search for an AIDS vaccine.</P>
    <P>Kofi Annan's report is an inspiring document. It has brought all the moral force of his position in the international arena to bear on the key issue of poverty. It reminds us in the most direct and blunt terms that a huge number of our fellow citizens continue to live on less than $1per day. The Secretary General demands that we act now and focus our efforts on the achievement of a number of development targets taken from the agreed results of the major UN conference of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid's policy objectives are very much in line with the thinking of the Secretary General. We are focused on the provision of basic health and education to the poorest of the poor. Our aim also is to lift people out of extreme poverty. Like the Secretary General, we believe this will require more development assistance from the rich countries and that this task will require co-ordinated international action over the long term. Also like the Secretary General, we are concerned by the marginalisation of the world's poorest countries from the global trading system, a system which has brought such economic benefits to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General's report provides our development co-operation programme with a clearly defined path towards the eradication of extreme poverty in the developing world. Its vision should underpin our efforts and inspire our activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the opportunity presented by this motion for a debate on Ireland's policy on overseas development aid. The timing of the debate is particularly appropriate given the horrific film and photographic coverage we have seen in recent weeks of the devastating impact, yet again, of famine and disease in Ethiopia. I also welcome the Minister's speech, which was very good in terms of the objectives the Department is setting out. What was missing from that speech is precisely what we looking for in this debate, which is a commitment to meet the 0.7% of GNP target set by the UN in 1970 within a specified period and to put that in legislation so that the issue is put beyond the annual haggling that takes place in relation to budgetary allocations and to which the ODA allocation has fallen victim, in percentage terms, in the past couple of budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifteen years ago the world was temporarily shaken out of its complacency by similar coverage of the famine that was then laying waste to Ethiopia and was to take more than one million lives. We had LiveAid, BandAid and many other fund raising initiatives. The people of this country <Col N="1316" /> reacted with particular generosity, contributing millions of pounds to famine relief. We had pledges this would never be allowed happen again. Unfortunately, famine, hunger and the needs of the people of the developing world were allowed slip down the political agenda and many of the pledges of action came to mean very little. I have no doubt the Irish people will react in just as generous a fashion as they did in the mid-1980s and that organisations such as Trócaire, Concern and GOAL will receive many contributions which will allow them alleviate, to some extent, the worst impact of the current famine.</P>
    <P>However, the generosity of individuals is not enough. Unless the wealthy countries of the developed world set about substantially increasing our aid programmes and tackling the urgent problem of Third World debt, famine and disease will continue to haunt much of the developing world and millions of people will die unnecessarily. Next year it may be Somalia, the following year Sudan and then back to Ethiopia again, unless concerted action is taken to break the vicious circle of hunger, underdevelopment and debt burden.</P>
    <P>The current famine in Ethiopia is particularly tragic because it was forecast by many of the relief agencies operating there. For instance, Trócaire has been implementing an emergency food security operation in Ethiopia since March 1999. While Ethiopia's entirely senseless and pointless war with Eritrea may have been a factor in worsening the situation, the cause of the current famine, which threatens up to eight million people potentially and where 400,000 are at immediate risk, is quite simply the outcome of a three year drought. In more developed countries, drought can lead to losses to farmers and inconvenience for the public. In a cripplingly poor, underdeveloped country like Ethiopia, drought means famine and death. The ordinary people of Ethiopia, who are enduring the brunt of the famine, are not responsible for the war with Eritrea. There must be no question of withholding or delaying aid because of the activities of the warlords in Addis Ababa.</P>
    <P>The response of the Irish Government to the famine in Ethiopia has been particularly disappointing, especially given that so many people are in danger. Last month, when the full extent of the crisis began to emerge, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, announced a grant of £100,000 to the UN world food programme, which she stated was &ldquo;in response to their appeal for funds to address serious food shortages in Ethiopia&rdquo;. Even if that £100,000 is added to the £259,000 allocated over the previous four months, it does not even amount to the cost of a semi-detached house in many areas of this city. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is able to forecast an expected budget surplus of £2.1 billion for the current year, but all we could give to save lives in Ethiopia was a measly £100,000.</P>
    <P>Our new found wealth gives us the opportunity and potential not just to address issues of <Col N="1317" /> inequality and disadvantage within Irish society, but also to make a more significant contribution to combating famine and disease. Unfortunately, the Government shows no serious inclination to do either. No doubt, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, would regard those who look for a substantial increase in our ODA as &ldquo;left wing pinkos&rdquo;. The Taoiseach might even regard us as &ldquo;creeping Jesuses&rdquo;. However, the fact is that the wealth and the will of the Irish people exist to give aid and it is the parsimony of the Government which has resulted in it not maintaining even its own intermediate targets.</P>
    <P>The ODA target of 0.7% of GNP was first set by the United Nations in the early 1970s. Thirty years on there is no excuse for not having met it. It might have been understandable in the 1980s, when we had major economic problems, with huge unemployment and a crippling national debt, for progress towards meeting the target to be slow, but there is absolutely no excuse now.</P>
    <P>What is even more disgraceful is that the Government is not even going to meet its own much more modest target. An Action Programme for the Millennium, published by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on taking office in 1997, said that a key priority on taking office would be adopting an interim target of at least 0.45% of GNP by 2002, on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7%. By the time the review of the action programme was published last October, the date for the achievement of the 0.45% target had been quietly dropped.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, told the House on 23 March what we already knew, which is that &ldquo;it is highly unlikely we will reach the target by 2002&rdquo;. The rather pathetic excuse offered by the Minister was that this was because of a change in the calculation of GNP. We all know the reason is that the Minister of State lost out in the budgetary haggle which resulted in ODA not getting its share. New targets are now being thrown around. The Minister talks about reaching 0.5% of GNP by 2005 while at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis the Taoiseach spoke of 0.7% by 2007. The reality is that the Government has failed miserably to meet its own target. This year the budget is only around 0.3% of GNP, just marginally ahead of the level when the Government came to office.</P>
    <P>The failure of other countries to meet their commitments is no excuse either. We should seek to be a model for Europe and the developed world. We should follow the example of another small European country, Denmark, which already spends almost 1% of its GNP on development co-operation. It is one of the most generous contributors in the OECD, with its aid amounting in 1998 to £1,704 million.</P>
    <P>I support fully the principle of the Fine Gael motion, that legislation should be introduced to provide for Ireland to meet the 0.7% target. As the motion says, this would remove ODA from the annual Estimates wrangle. In January of this year, my party Leader, Deputy Quinn, published <Col N="1318" /> the text of a Private Members' Bill, the Ireland Aid Bill, 2000, which would have placed a legal requirement on whatever Government was in office to meet and sustain the 0.7% target. Unfortunately, because of outdated Standing Orders, we were unable to table the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, I disagree with Fine Gael on the timetable over which the 0.7% target could be achieved. The Labour Party believes that the deadline of 2007 is much too far away. With the resources available, political will and the co-operation of international agencies and Irish NGOs, there is no reason the target could not be met by the year 2003, and we have tabled an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, if the House so agrees.</P>

      <P>Ireland trades on its history as a post-colonial country when it addresses the Third World. In the EU, Ireland was insistent in its demands that the richer countries at the centre should help those on the periphery. We benefited enormously from this and there is now an obligation on us to assist others in overcoming difficulties far more severe than those ever faced by this State.</P>
      <P>Overseas development aid makes a difference. Some progress has been made over the past 25 years, although poverty remains at appalling levels, with some 1.5 billion people living on less than a dollar per day. Despite a huge growth in population from 2.9 billion in 1970 to around 4.8 billion today, <i>per capita </i>growth in developing countries has been inching forward at the rate of around 1.3% per annum. Life expectancy, while still way below levels in the developed world, has risen by about four months each year since 1970. Some diseases like smallpox have been eliminated altogether.</P>
      <P>The income gap between rich and poor continues to increase, however. In 1960, the income gap ratio between the fifth of the world's population living in the richest countries and the fifth living in the poorest countries was 30:1. In 1990, it was 60:1 and in 1997, 74:1. Millions of people still lack access to sanitation, water, health and education. As we have seen in Ethiopia, whole countries remain vulnerable to drought or to natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Certainly, Ireland on its own cannot solve the problems of the developing world, but we can do far more than we are doing now. Setting a legislative target for the 0.7% figure would be a start and would be an example to all other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other related problem faced by developing countries which must be addressed by the developed world is the issue of debt. We need a generous attitude and a long-term perspective towards the debt problems in the developing world. Unless the crushing burden of debt service is lifted, many of the poorest countries will <Col N="1319" /> remain excluded from the benefits that flow from an increasingly integrated world economy. Their continued inability to offer their people the health and lifestyles that are taken for granted elsewhere will be impossible to sustain.</P>
    <P>Facilitating the revitalisation of the economies in these underdeveloped countries, partially through debt elimination, will in any case confer great benefits on the world economy. There is a broad public consensus that the Third World debt burden is unsustainable, unrepayable and perverse in its social impact. Debt burdens of this magnitude impact disastrously on growth, human development and the social structures of the developing countries. Only two among the world's 41 most highly indebted developing nations achieved the somewhat modest target of 2% <i>per capita </i>GDP growth since 1980. Moreover, the situation is getting worse, not better. Since 1980 the debt burden of the world's poorest countries has more than tripled. Two thirds of that increase is the direct result of arrears of interest or principal on missed payment deadlines or earlier debt.</P>
    <P>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will hold their spring meeting this weekend. I urge the Government to ensure that our representatives at the meeting press strongly for the full cancellation of Third World debt.</P>

      <P>Yes. I wish to conclude at this point and give the floor to Deputy Higgins. I urge the Government to take a strong stance in favour of full and complete Third World debt cancellation. I recognise that we are not a debtor nation and are not owed money by these developing countries. Accepting our motion which proposes to legally enforce the idea of reaching the UN development aid target of 0.7% of GNP within a specified period would strengthen our hand in making that case at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy De Rossa, I congratulate the Fine Gael Party, particularly Deputy Gay Mitchell who tabled the motion. I urge support for our proposal to make the 0.7% target achievable within a shorter period. It is many years since we first discussed overseas development aid and achieving the UN target figure. We need to recognise, however, that at the rate we are going and with the best will in the world, despite the very thorough speech from the Minister, all the indications are that matters will be very much worse. The evidence is available to anybody who wants to take note of it, that matters are deteriorating in the Third World, particularly in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the major <Col N="1320" /> report by the UN Secretary General. In addition, the 1996 UNDP report on human development showed that as regards the three great hinges that link the developing world with the western world &ndash; aid, trade and debt &ndash; things have deteriorated enormously. As regards trade, the so-called developing countries had about $5 trillion out of $23 trillion of global gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>In the last 30 years, the poorest 20% have seen their income share fall from 2.3% to 1.4%. On the other hand, the richest 20% have seen their incomes rise from 70% to 85% of total income. One of the most interesting figures that is quoted is that the personal wealth of the 350 billionaires currently noted in the world exceeds the total income of countries with 45% of the world's population.</P>
    <P>In 1991, 85% of the world's population received 15% of the world's income. No matter what way one calculates it, one can see that nothing has changed structurally that will help those who rely on primary products to get a greater share of trade.</P>
    <P>Third World debt has become catastrophic to the point at which it now becomes moral to seek cancellation as the only way forward. It is important that we should not deflect from structural aid every time we have a disaster. The net additionality of emergency aid has to be established so that structural aid allocations are not drawn upon to meet more immediate needs. One wants to meet such needs but the additionality has to become manifest.</P>
    <P>Matters are getting worse in the Third World, yet I notice a certain weariness among some sections of the public, particularly with regard to Africa. People point out that it is an inhibiting factor in aid that the structure of civil society is not strong. To make that statement also puts the burden of history on people who must answer the question as to what was the burden carried by the colonisation of Africa, a continent that was literally raped.</P>
    <P>I said that matters would be a great deal worse if things proceeded as they are, but globalisation is already making matters much worse. The enormous speed of capital is creating societies that have become economies. They in turn have become markets and have been narrowed down to financial markets or flows. That is crude shorthand but it describes what is happening. They have had the benefit of a total reconstruction in time and space which, when one compares it with the movement of human populations into towns and cities, has created an enormous problem on continents such as Asia, Africa and Latin America. Globalisation, uncriticised by those who are benefiting from it, is creating a massive distortion of speculative growth. In the US, 7% of the population have the experience of homelessness at some stage of their lives. There has been a growth in all inequalities in some of the beneficiary countries. More importantly, we are visiting upon the other countries we are addressing an appalling <Col N="1321" /> model of development that condemns them to poverty.</P>
    <P>There are more phone connections, for example, in Manhattan than there are in sub-Saharan Africa. To suggest that the telecommunications revolution and globalisation will not affect what we are addressing is to be naive. It will make matters worse and that is what gives urgency to this motion and to the amendment. We should respond adequately.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hospital Waiting Lists.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this matter. This is not something that has happened since the elevation of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs, but it is something of which he is aware as a constituency colleague as well as a Cabinet Minister.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that over the past few years, in spite of increased spending on the health services of the order of 45%, there is little in terms of a service to the community by return. The situation in Tullamore General Hospital, which is the orthopaedic unit serving the midland counties of Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois, is such as to give rise to serious concern. The increase in the hospital waiting list is to the order of 52% since the Government took office.</P>
      <P>In mid-1997 there were 1,378 persons on the waiting list and in April 2000 that number has risen to 2,127. The bulk of these are persons waiting for orthopaedic and ear, nose and throat surgery, many of whom are children, many of whom are suffering and many of whom are in pain. Clearly, the current Government strategy, if there is one, is failing abysmally as far as the Midland Health Board is concerned. I charge the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, with responsibility in that regard.</P>
      <P>Of the 2,127 people awaiting treatment in Tullamore hospital, 815 people have been on the waiting list for treatment for a year or more. These 815 people have been waiting for a bed for a period in excess of 12 months. Almost half, or 443, have been waiting over a year for ear, nose and throat procedures. Some 88 people have been on the waiting list for hip or knee operations for over a year in the Midland Health Board area. The sample profile is that of a man, a breadwinner in his early sixties, almost immobile, suffering considerable pain while waiting with his 87 colleagues for over a year for a bed in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures surely demonstrate the very serious problems within the health services, with particular reference to the Midland Health Board. The response of the Government, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health <Col N="1322" /> and Children, Deputy Moffatt, will surely inform us again, is to increase the health spending by the order of 45%. Simply throwing money at the problem will not resolve the issue. There appear to be more serious problems, particularly in the area of orthopaedics.</P>
    <P>Many of these people who are waiting are elderly. They are sick, sore and suffering. It flies in the face of a booming economy that we have 815 people awaiting treatment for over a year. If any of these people had a cheque book or a healthy bank balance they would not be waiting for a year or for a month but would have their treatment straight away. Such is the inequity within our health services that persons who cannot pay top dollar or top buck will not have the opportunity to have their procedure, be it surgical or otherwise, dealt with to relieve them of the pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>The situation in Tullamore hospital is the fifth worst in the land. The waiting list, outside the Dublin area and excluding University College Hospital, Cork, is the longest in the country.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the dedication of the staff at Tullamore General Hospital. Recent criticism levelled at those who engage in quoting figures for waiting lists seems to suggest that there is some correlation between persons waiting in a queue and a less than efficient attitude on the part of the staff. The staff are in no way to blame for the waiting lists in this instance.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to remarks attributed to the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board who stated that the quoting of figures such as I have cited is not only less than helpful but, as he says, 'political nonsense'. I take severe exception to these comments. The role and function of the chief executive officer of the health board is not to act in any way as a ministerial side-kick in this issue. He should get on with the job of ensuring there is an efficient service and deal with the thousands of applications from persons waiting for treatment at Tullamore General Hospital. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I fully appreciate his concerns regarding waiting lists for treatment at Tullamore General Hospital and this is reflected in the priority that the Minister is attaching to addressing comprehensively the issue of lengthy waiting lists and times for in-patient treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective the Government has set itself is to ensure that all public patients are treated within the target waiting times of 12 months for adults and six months for children. The Minister is committed to endeavouring to achieve that objective. To do so, the problem must be addressed on a number of fronts to take account of both the need for immediate action to enable more waiting list work to be performed and the more strategic approach required to tackle the underlying factors that give rise to <Col N="1323" /> lengthy waiting lists and waiting times in the first place.</P>
    <P>In terms of the latter, the Deputy will be aware that former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, established an expert group to review the waiting list initiative which reported to him in 1998. In considering the multi-faceted nature of the issue of waiting lists this group took full account of the international experience, carefully examining the dynamics at work in the health system and how it can be better organised and managed to achieve easier access to services for public patients.</P>
    <P>The result of the analysis was a comprehensive series of wide-ranging recommendations of short, medium and long-term nature aimed at addressing the underlying causes of the problem. My Department has been reviewing progress to date with the individual chief executive officers concerned in the implementation of the review group's recommendation. This is encouraging evidence of good progress in putting in place many of the organisational arrangements recommended, including IT systems, liaison arrangements with general practitioners, management and validation of lists, management of out-patient facilities and the appointment of dedicated waiting list co-ordinators, bed utilisation committees and bed managers.</P>
    <P>It is possible to identify a certain correlation between the level of progress achieved by agencies in implementing the review group's recommendations and their performance on reducing waiting lists. This provides encouraging evidence that progress is possible and enables us to identify the particular areas where more attention needs to be focused.</P>
    <P>It has to be appreciated also that some of the measures recommended in the review group's report have not achieved an immediate impact on waiting lists due to their being aimed at addressing underlying factors and will, therefore, by nature, take time to bear fruit. In addition, many of the infrastructural capacity issues, particularly in relation to the availability of long-term and step-down facilities, can take more time to address comprehensively. The availability of £1 billion for the non-acute sector under the national development plan will enable significant progress to be made in this area. In terms of overall capacity in the acute sector the capacity review committed to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is now being progressed.</P>
    <P>In the specific case of Tullamore General Hospital, the Deputy is aware of the concrete steps being taken to address the clear capacity issue there in the form of a major £70 million hospital development that is currently in planning.</P>
    <P>This planned development is a clear acknowledgement by the Government of infrastructural deficits at the hospital that have been present for some time. More importantly, it is testament to this Government's commitment to address these <Col N="1324" /> deficits and I am confident it will have a major impact in the medium and longer term on access to hospital services in the region.</P>
    <P>In the shorter term, this Government has committed major funding under the waiting list initiative. This year £23 million of dedicated funding has been allocated, which includes £1.372 million to the Midland Health Board for additional waiting list procedures and improved management processes. To maximise the impact of the available funding, there are a number of practical short-term steps the Minister has proposed in his discussions with the chief executives and that have been followed up in the Department's ongoing contacts with them. These include achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. For example, we need to examine arrangements such as doing concentrated, protected, waiting list work during traditional summer closure periods, or cross-contracting activity from agencies where spare capacity exists. My Department has just completed a round of discussions with the health board chief executives aimed at moving forward on this basis and proposals are now awaited from each, including the Midland Health Board.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, it is possible to make significant inroads to tackle unsatisfactory access to certain services. The Minister intends to address these issues through the practical short and longer term measures I have outlined and I am confident, on this basis, of reducing waiting lists and times for access to services at Tullamore General Hospital and throughout the acute system.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - PRSI Contributions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this topic for debate. The purpose of this motion is to examine the system of PRSI contributions, their conditions and benefits to try to improve the present system by making minor changes. The PRSI system is a fair way of putting money aside to ensure that benefits can be paid out to workers and their spouses, should the need arise. The principle is sound. However, there seems to be a flaw in part of the system for a certain age category. For people between the ages of 25 to 28 or 29 in many cases, the PRSI contribution conditions for treatment benefits are clearly unfair. The benefits to which I am referring are treatment benefits including dental benefit which offers free dental examination, free diagnosis, free scaling and polishing of teeth and partial payment for further treatment. It also includes optical benefits and benefits towards payment for hearing aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for PRSI treatment benefits for somebody who is considered to be starting work, in other words before they reach 25 years of age, they must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since <Col N="1325" /> starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year &ndash; the tax year before they claim. This is fair and is a reasonable time for a young person to wait before receiving benefits. However, the problem arises when a young person reaches 25 years of age. He or she suddenly must have 260 weeks PRSI contributions paid since first starting work. In other words, they must have completed at least five to six years of work before they can qualify for treatment benefits. This huge jump in PRSI contribution requirements results in discrimination against people in their mid and late 20s. In order to qualify for the treatment benefits associated with PRSI contribution at the age of 25, one would have to have worked from about the age of 17, 18, or if they are lucky, 19.</P>
    <P>Many more young people are choosing to enter third level education and, therefore, are not beginning full-time employment until the age of 22 or 23 or sometimes even later. Those new members of the work force find themselves eligible for benefits for two or three years and then at 25 suddenly they lose their benefits until they have completed 260 weeks of PRSI payments, or until they are about 30 years of age. This aspect of the system is farcical. For many young people, including a constituent of mine who brought this anomaly to my attention, they only realise to what benefits they are entitled when they are 25 or 26 years of age. The irony is that they realise they were entitled to benefits at 23 and 24 which they never took up but suddenly they are no longer eligible until they reach about 30.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a fairer system which does not have such a large jump in PRSI contribution conditions at this so-called benchmark of 25 years of age. I ask him to consider a system which will introduce a less radical jump with partial increases in the number of weeks required in PRSI payments at various stages over several years in somebody's 20s instead of this jump from 39 weeks to 260 weeks when a young person reaches 25 years of age. We are trying to encourage young people to further their education, to take up third level education and to stay in college for as long as possible to maximise their skills levels. If we are to do this, we cannot on the other hand discriminate against them with our social welfare system, which we are at the moment. With a little imagination this problem can be solved relatively easily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>An underlying principle of the social insurance system is that to establish entitlement to benefit, a person must have been insurably employed and paid appropriate PRSI contributions for a certain length of time. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to treatment benefit vary depending on the age of the insured person. Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must <Col N="1326" /> have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year, of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66 of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions. The latter requirement, that is the 13 weeks paid contributions, does not apply in the case of certain social welfare recipients. The treatment benefit scheme provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. As regards dental benefit, an examination and scale and polish is available free of charge to the qualified claimant. In the case of fillings and extractions, the Minister's Department pays 70% of the agreed fee in accordance with the scale of fees negotiated on behalf of the dentists operating the scheme and the claimant pays the balance. An agreed fee also applies in the case of dentures with the claimant and the Department each paying 50%. For other treatments, the Department pays a fixed contribution towards the cost and the claimant is liable for the balance charged by the dentist.</P>
      <P>As regards optical benefit, the qualified person can obtain an eye examination free of charge together with a pair of spectacles from a limited range of frames. Where a more expensive frame is chosen, the Department pays a fixed contribution with the claimant paying the balance. A similar arrangement applies in the case of contact lenses. In the case of hearing aids, the Minister's Department pays up to one half of the cost of a hearing aid subject to a maximum payment of £225 and up to half the cost of any repairs.</P>
      <P>In 1999, some 618,000 claims for treatment benefit were approved by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs at a cost of some £35.6 million. Some 430,000 related to dental benefit. The PRSI contribution conditions for treatment benefit are generally in line with those applying to other contributory benefit schemes. These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing limited resources towards those in greatest need, including dependent spouses of insured workers. They also ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record. While the Minister has no plans to change these contribution conditions, the conditions of all schemes are kept under review. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the matter of accommodation in Balscadden national school in north County Dublin. This school, which was opened in 1986, is comprised of six classrooms, one general purpose room, one staff room, which is 14 feet by nine feet nine inches, and one room which is 13 feet three inches by nine feet two inches. This room serves as office, medical room and library. For the past four years the general purpose room has been used as a classroom and this year it has been further subdivided with a wooden partition to accommodate two classes, fifth and sixth classes, with 21 and 24 pupils respectively.</P>
      <P>Having visited the school recently, I can confirm the situation is totally unacceptable in terms of the children's education, welfare, health and safety. Other factors include noise and light &ndash; one can hear the normal interaction of teacher and children in other rooms and there is no natural light in the temporary rooms as those rooms have no windows. Ventilation and heating are also matters of great concern to both teachers and parents.</P>
      <P>The school has a teaching principal, six teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The morning I visited the school the remedial teacher was using an already congested small staff room to teach her pupils. I was appalled that the pupils in most need of attention were being taught in such an environment. There were five or six computers in the narrow hallway leading from the front door &ndash; that is where these children are being introduced to computer studies. Given that the general purpose room is being used as a classroom, there is no room for subjects such as physical education, drama and dancing, although there is a great tradition of drama and dancing in rural north County Dublin. Accordingly, it is very sad that these subjects are unavailable in the school.</P>
      <P>I compliment the principal and staff on the way they have overcome these difficulties to give their best to the children. Notwithstanding their success, the situation is totally unsatisfactory. The pupils' parents are threatening to protest at the Department's inaction and one cannot blame them. I have asked them to withhold action pending an early response from the Minister. The ball is in the Minister of State's court. According to new staffing schedules, the school is entitled to an additional teacher from next September. I understand that an inspector from the Department visited the school last September and was apprised of the situation. It is totally unacceptable that the Department has not contacted the board of management by this time of year to confirm that approval has been sanctioned for two additional classrooms for September next. Such an announcement is critical, as planning permission must be secured and the classrooms must be in place by the end of August. Nothing else is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> In an era of unprecedented economic buoyancy, with more money available to this Government than to any other in the history of the State, it is a scandal that the children of Balscadden are subjected to such draconian conditions. The ball is over the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the chance to outline the Department's current position regarding the provision of additional accommodation at Balscadden national school. At present the school has a staffing level of a principal and seven assistant teachers, as the Deputy said. Its facilities include six classrooms and a general purpose room. The Department received an application last year from the school authorities seeking grant assistance towards providing additional classroom accommodation. The application is being examined in the context of a range of factors, including proposed housing developments in the area. This examination will enable the Department to establish the likely pattern of future enrolments and, in that way, to determine the amount of school accommodation required.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a large number of school building projects on hand with the Department. Because of the priority which the Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools previously evident, the spending estimates show that primary school building and renovation funding increased by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation of the previous Administration. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by the management authorities of Balscadden national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible. I thank him again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.</P>

      <P>The Limerick Institute of Technology is an excellent college which has provided great service to students not only from Limerick and the mid-west but from all over the country. Like many of the institutes of technology it specialises in technological subjects and again, like the other institutes, it has been one of the main contributors to supplying the highly skilled workforce we now have driving forward the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, a controversy has arisen which resulted today in the entire student body leaving lectures and going into a full protest at the college. They stated they will not return until the difficulties faced by certain students doing an <Col N="1329" /> architectural technology degree course are resolved. These students entered the college two years ago and started off with a difficulty as the course advertised in the college prospectus was changed at the point when students send in their change of mind forms to the colleges. Many of them were not aware of the change from that advertised in the prospectus.</P>
    <P>Up to 1998 the students did three full years, effectively becoming master technicians at drawing, both manually and with computers. Computer aided design was their speciality and they were much sought after by architectural practices throughout these islands. The course was so highly thought of that the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland gave seven successive silver medals to graduates of this course.</P>
    <P>A change was made and the first year was given over to management theory while the second year has become a drawing year. Students are expected to go out on placement for the third year, but they feel they should spend third year doing what they are interested in, a year of drawing practice within the college, with something similar in fourth year. The difficulty is that the students are supported by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, which has withdrawn recognition of the course. They are left in a situation where they are pursuing a course they did not sign on for in the first place and where recognition by the institute representing their prospective employers has been withdrawn. There is another difficulty in that a Scottish university, Heriot-Watt, awards degrees after fourth year of this course and there seems to be a conflict between what the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland requires of its future employees and what the university requires in terms of a degree course. The controversy has gone on intermittently for a number of years. The students are at the end of their second year and the controversy reached a high point when, for reasons which are difficult to explain, they were suspended by the college. They were under the impression they were suspended indefinitely but the college authorities explained it was a one day suspension.</P>
    <P>All attempts to resolve the dispute have failed. It escalated today when the general body of students joined the architectural technology degree students. It has become, in trade union parlance, an official dispute because the students' union is supporting it. I ask the Minister to get involved. The dispute has been going on locally for two years and I do not believe it will be resolved locally. Will the Minister accede to the students' request for a meeting and to send a person of goodwill to the college, someone with skills of arbitration, conciliation and fecilitation, so that a problem which has escalated out of all proportion can be amicably resolved?</P>
    <P>These students fear for their future. They have invested a great deal in their careers. They see their hopes being dashed as prospective employers refuse to acknowledge their qualifi<Col N="1330" /> cation. A great sourness has entered the debate and I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Minister for Education and Science the importance of direct intervention so this dispute can be quickly resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this issue and for the opportunity it affords me to clarify the position. As the issues raised are matters for which the institute has responsibility under the relevant Acts, it would be useful if I set out the legislative position on the governance and management of institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992 to 1999, the governing body and the director of an institute of technology are responsible for the management and control of the affairs of the institute.</P>
      <P>Under the Act it is a function of the institute to provide such courses of study as its governing body considers appropriate, subject to the annual programme and budget approval process laid down in the Act.</P>
      <P>The Act also requires each institute to have an academic council appointed by the governing body to assist in planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing the educational work of the institute and to protect, maintain and develop the academic standards of the courses and activities of the institute. The functions, which the academic council has under the Act include the following: to design, develop and assist in implementing courses of study in accordance with the programmes and budget approved annually and to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised in relation to Limerick Institute of Technology, I understand the issue arises from changes introduced by the institute in its course in architectural technology as a result of a restructuring of the course. As I have outlined above, such modifications or alterations to a specific course in an institute of technology arise in the context of the normal process of academic planning and review in such higher education institutions. The position, therefore, is that the Minister for Education and Science has no function under the Act in such academic matters. Similarly, in regard to the issue of student discipline, under the Act this is also a matter entirely for the institute and it would be inappropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene in an institute's handling of such internal operational matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From recent publicity, the Minister is aware of the situation which arose in the Limerick Institute of Technology and which resulted in a number of students being suspended. As a result, his Department has been in contact with the management of the institute and has been informed as follows. The institute has indicated to the Department of Education and Science that no student has been expelled. A group of students from the second year of the BSc in Architectural Technology <Col N="1331" /> course were suspended for one day on Friday, 7 April, for failing to accept an instruction to leave an administrative area of the institute. Students were free to return to class on Monday, 10 April and the president of the students' union was so informed. The question of readmission does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>In regard to the course in question the institute has informed the Minister for Education and Science of the following: the course of BSc in Architectural Technology has the formal recognition at degree level of Heriot-Watt University; the course is the result of recommendations of external examiners and feedback from former students and without the implementation of their recommendations continuation of degree recognition <Col N="1332" /> would not be possible; and institute management met student representatives on Monday and updated and reassured them as to the recognised status of the course.</P>
    <P>The situation which arose recently in Limerick Institute of Technology and which the Deputy has raised here today is a matter for the institute to resolve. I am confident that the institute will do its utmost to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned. Having listened with great interest to Deputy Noonan's contribution, I will refer the matter to the Minister for Education and Science to see if progress can be made to allow students return to normal life and pursue their education at a vital time for them.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 April 2000.</P>

      <QRef>[10513/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): This Government is particularly concerned about children living in poverty. Consideration is being given to the introduction of further policy responses on a number of fronts to help ensure that our children are given the opportunity to break out of the poverty cycle.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a number of commitments in relation to child welfare. In the context of the forthcoming review of the national anti-poverty strategy, new targets will be considered under various themes, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, all policy proposals across Government Departments are poverty proofed to ensure that the needs of children, among other target groups, are kept to the fore in the design of policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of the Combat Poverty Agency's suggested minimum income for children, this issue will be considered further in the light of the report of the working group on the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare rates, which will be set up in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>This Government shares the view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or to improving wages.</P>
    <P>The recent 2000 budget provides for a £106 million investment in child benefit. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. The unemployment rate is now well below the EU average and <Col N="1334" /> the live register has fallen by over 90,000 since we took up office.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment has fallen more rapidly than the live register as a whole and employment opportunities have increased. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce. By increasing income from work, not just the individuals themselves benefit, but the families and communities in which they live.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the situation where recipients of disability allowance may find themselves on a reduced payment on reaching qualification age for old age pension; if he acknowledges that applicants in such cases should be paid the rate of the higher payment for which they qualified; if he proposes to continue this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability allowance (formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance) is paid up to 66 years, at which stage a person becomes eligible for the old age (non-contributory) pension. Under the old age (non-contributory) pension scheme, means are generally assessed on a more favourable basis than they are under other social assistance schemes, including disability allowance. Accordingly, a person who had been in receipt of disability allowance would, in the normal course, qualify for the old age (non-contributory) pension on reaching 66 years, the rate of which would generally be higher than that which they had been receiving while on disability allowance.</P>
      <P>However, there will be some cases where a person would qualify for an old age pension at a lower rate than disability allowance. For instance, a person's income position can change on reaching pension age, e.g. they or their spouse may qualify for an occupational pension or a social security pension from another State. Such income would be assessable for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that there are a small number of cases where claimants for the old age (non-contributory) pension may be assessed with higher means than under the disability allowance scheme. This arises because of variations in the operation of the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme prior to its take-over by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the operation of the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme was the subject of much criticism. The variation in the application process was one of a number of problems with the scheme which were highlighted by many Deputies, representative groups and by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. For example, the commission identified that the health boards dif<Col N="1335" /> fered widely in their application of eligibility and means testing criteria. They recommended therefore, that all disability payments should be provided for in legislation which makes clear that there is a legal right to payment.</P>
    <P>The transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to my Department meant the scheme was brought within the scope of social welfare legislation. Accordingly, national standards apply so as to provide a legal entitlement to payment where the claimant fulfils the relevant conditions. There is also a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. In addition, since its transfer a range of improvements have been made in the eligibility and means test criteria under the disability allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>With the improved eligibility criteria and the improved administration there has been a significant increase in the numbers in receipt of the allowance, from 34,500 in October, 1996 to almost 51,000 in February, 2000, i.e. an increase of 48%.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it was recognised that even with these improvements, because of the variable way in which the former scheme had been operated, there would be some cases where people who had no statutory entitlement would have been in receipt of payment and others who were in receipt of payment at a higher rate than their statutory entitlements. It was for these reasons that transitional arrangements were introduced by my predecessor which provided that, on the take-over of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme in October 1996, nobody who had been in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance up until then would lose out solely because of the transfer over to disability allowance.</P>
    <P>However, the transitional arrangements do not preclude entitlement being subsequently reviewed as part of the normal claims review process or if the person's circumstances have changed since the take-over of the scheme, e.g. if there is a change in their means or if they transfer to another social welfare payment. In these circumstances the normal eligibility criteria, as set out in the relevant social welfare legislation, would apply.</P>

      <P>The commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to <Col N="1336" /> produce a publication in the context of a review of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme. The review is part of my Department's series of programme evaluations and commenced in February 2000. The report outlining the findings is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives of the review is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current policy and administrative arrangements and to make recommendations for improvements where required. The review will include a widespread process of consultation with users of the SWA service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners and the health boards who administer the scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of discretion by community welfare officers is an important feature of the SWA scheme. It enables health boards to respond in a flexible and timely manner in a wide range of circumstances where hardship would otherwise occur. This flexibility and responsiveness is one of the main strengths of the scheme and it is made possible by the fact that the health boards can exercise discretion. However, discretion also means that there is an element of uncertainty about whether a payment will be made in any particular case because it is not possible or desirable to set out hard and fast rules governing the circumstances in which all of these payments are made. In some categories of cases, there may be no need for the use of discretion because it is clear that the circumstances of the persons concerned warrant a payment.</P>
      <P>These matters will be examined in detail by the working group undertaking the review. In particular, the working group will examine whether the correct balance is struck between rules-based entitlements and discretionary payments within the SWA system. It may be possible to identify some needs which can be better met in some other fashion, for example, through improvements in other schemes or through new schemes.</P>
      <P>Discretion will remain a fundamental feature of the SWA scheme to meet needs which cannot be met or are not being met through other means. A booklet of comprehensive guidance on discretionary payments such as exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments was published in 1996. In addition, circulars are issued to health boards from time to time to give guidance on various aspects of the scheme, as the need arises. A user-friendly publication outlining community welfare officer guidelines on the operation of discretion in the supplementary welfare allowance system will be drawn up in the light of the points made in the course of the consultation process and the findings of the review itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>As announced in budget 2000, an annual allocation of £5 million has been provided to my Department to support provision of out-of-school hours and child care services in disadvantaged communities. It is envisaged that the funding will mainly be made available to the projects funded under the community development support programmes, viz: community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; and core-funded community and family support groups programme.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental committee on child care recommended that funding be provided totalling £5 million per annum for community groups towards developing out of school hours services. The committee anticipated that the provision of this funding to less well off communities would address a number of issues, viz., 1. the provision of low cost out-of-school child care for parents who are in the paid labour market; 2. practical support for children who need additional support to maintain their interest in school; 3. the promotion of parental and community involvement in engaging young people in school and community life, and 4. the provision of additional community based services for families.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the spirit of partnership which informs the way in which these community development programmes are managed in my Department, a working group representative of the local community development groups themselves and other interests and expertise in the child care area has been set up to advise on the detailed design of this scheme and in particular issues such as criteria for applications, technical support needs, service standards, staff issues, etc.</P>
      <P>I expect that the working group will complete its work on the details of the scheme within the next few weeks. Given the need to allow sufficient time for local groups to draw up and submit applications, I anticipate that I will be in a position to commence allocation of monies under the scheme in May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The number of claimants in receipt of family income supplement (FIS) at end-March 2000 was 14,399. Entitlement to FIS is related to current household income and the number of dependant children in the family, as well as to the number of hours worked per week. As the Revenue Commissioners do not as a matter of course capture data relating to children or to hours worked, it is not possible to draw any meaningful comparisons between the level of take-up of FIS and data held by the Revenue Commissioners on the number of taxpayers coming within the various FIS income bands.</P>
      <P>The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment that a working group will be established to examine the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems. This working group will also examine the possibility of paying FIS through the tax system.</P>
      <P>The two issues are closely related since a substantial number of FIS claimants have income which comes below the tax exemption limits appropriate to their family size. In order for such families to benefit from a tax credits system the payment would have to take the form of a refundable tax credit.</P>
      <P>There are other issues also which will have to be addressed by the working group. As I mentioned earlier, entitlement to FIS is not determined solely on the basis of the claimant's current earnings. Account is also taken of family size, hours worked, the likely duration of employment, as well as any earnings which the spouse or partner of the claimant, where relevant, may have. Not all of this information is collected at present through tax returns made to the Revenue Commissioners, and the tax system is therefore not at present capable of automatically identifying the households with an entitlement to FIS. Indeed earnings information would not generally be available to the Revenue Commissioners until some time after the end of the tax year in which it is earned. Any payment through the tax system would therefore still have to operate on the basis of the individual in the first instance supplying the additional information needed to establish entitlement to the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to seeing the results of the working group in due course. Obviously, <Col N="1339" /> measures which are capable of advancing the interests of low paid workers with families will be viewed positively by this Government.</P>
    <P>In the interim, the FIS system continues to be enhanced. From next month, the income thresholds are being increased by £13 at each point. In addition, I am providing also that the current minimum FIS payment of £5 per week will be increased to £10 per week from next month.</P>

      <P>On foot of reports from the board, it is proposed the Bill will make provision for the treatment of pension scheme surpluses in wind-up situations, the establishment of a pensions ombudsman, the extension of equal treatment in the area of occupational pensions and the setting-up of a limited pensions compensation fund. Other recommendations in the board's report relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation of occupational pensions will also be provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill will provide for amendments arising from the practical application of the provisions of the Pensions Act and will provide for compliance with the terms of EU Directive (98/49/EC) on the mobility of workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 97 and 318 together.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes is being published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, today and I will be launching this later this evening. I have arranged that a copy of the report will be made available to Members of both Houses this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first major review of these schemes since they were introduced in the 1960s. The 12 priority proposals put forward for consideration <Col N="1341" /> in the review are as follows extension of the free schemes to all people over the age of 75, regardless of income and household composition; extension of the free electricity allowance and free TV licence to carers in receipt of carer's allowance; introduction of the same living alone conditions for all free schemes by relaxing the living alone conditions for the free telephone rental allowance; increase in the number of electricity units allowed from 1,500 to 1,800 per annum; increase in the number of telephone call units allowed from 120 to 240 per annum; extension of the free fuel schemes to all people aged 75 and over regardless of income and household composition; establishment of a social transport fund to support local transport initiatives in order to address specific transport access and take-up inequities. The type of services envisaged would be community based, outside the public transport system and probably not sustainable without some type of subsidy; extension of the companion free travel pass to people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone; alignment of the three household schemes into a single household benefits package; investigation of alternative payment arrangements and supplier relationships to achieve best value for money for the goods and services provided under the aegis of the schemes; establishment of a rational and transparent basis for reimbursing the suppliers of free travel services and placing the schemes on a statutory basis and funding the cost of the schemes for persons in receipt of contributory pensions from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>I have already implemented, in Budget 2000, the first two of the above proposals. This extends the free schemes to all people aged over 75 regardless of income and household composition and also to carers in receipt of the carer's allowance. In addition, I have provided in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, that the cost of the schemes will be funded from the social insurance fund for those in receipt of contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I also intend to move towards the establishment of a single household benefits scheme in future budgets. This will amalgamate the existing separate free schemes administered by my Department into a single household benefits scheme with a streamlined application process.</P>
    <P>The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services. In this regard it notes that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport. The report notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not obliged to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles access<Col N="1342" /> ible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport.</P>
    <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes also examined the issue of extending the free schemes to retired public servants and recommended that this group should qualify for the frees schemes in view of the wider social objectives of care in the community. The review considered that the extension of the frees to those over age 75 would be of significant benefit to this group.</P>
    <P>The report examines a great number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 143 of 1 March 2000, the number of supplementary welfare allowance payments in 1999 where a person had no means and was awaiting determination from a Government Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>Payments are made where a person has no means to meet his or her immediate needs pending payment from another source, for example, where he or she are awaiting determination of an application for a social welfare or a health board payment. Some 12,223 people were in receipt of these interim payments on 31 December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may know, provision has been made in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to allow my Department to pay SWA in these cases, where it is appropriate to do so. Certain organisational changes will have to be made before these arrangements can be put in place and in the <Col N="1343" /> meantime the health boards will continue to make interim payments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that basic weekly SWA payments are made to asylum seekers who are awaiting determination of their claims to asylum. At present, there are some 7,000 households receiving SWA payments while awaiting a final outcome to their claims for asylum.</P>

      <P>The new focus of the NESF &ndash; on monitoring and analysing the implementation of specific measures and programmes, especially those concerned with social inclusion &ndash; opens up valuable new opportunities for the implementation of public policy.</P>
      <P>As part of this new role, the NESF recently held a plenary on the national anti-poverty strategy (NAPS) which I addressed. This plenary was an important part of a process that will lead to the production of an NESF opinion on NAPS which will examine the process over the last three years. I look forward to seeing the forum's report.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has carried out an initial assessment of the NAPS and this will be launched at a national conference &ndash;&ldquo;Planning for a more Inclusive Society&rdquo;&ndash; on 11 May.</P>
      <P>The NESF opinion, when considered together with the Combat Poverty Agency's assessment, will provide us with a very good overview of developments to date and will contribute to policy development in relation to NAPS.</P>
      <P>The new partnership agreement &ndash; Programme for Prosperity and Fairness' &ndash; provides for the updating of the NAPS. The methodology underlying the strategy will be reviewed, existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate. In particular, new targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, and housing/ accommodation. This process will be completed during the first 18 months of the programme.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall NAPS review, the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) has been asked to undertake a review of the poverty proofing process. Poverty proofing is a major tool in assisting Government to build an inclusive society by keeping social inclusion to the fore in policy making at all times. It is intended that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to derive the information sought by the Deputy from the records of my Department.</P>
      <P>However, research undertaken by the ESRI on behalf of the Combat Poverty Agency and published in 1994 under the title Income Distribution within Irish Households indicated that among households receiving child benefit, 58% of women had no other source of income.</P>
      <P>The research was based on the responses given by a random sample of 625 couples to a survey in 1989. Given the significant increase in female labour force participation rates in the intervening period, it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of women for whom child benefit remains the sole direct source of income will have declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> Child benefit is a monthly payment which is paid direct to the mother in the great majority of cases. The research published by the Combat Poverty Agency confirmed that this policy approach is appropriate, since the payment is more likely to be spent to the direct benefit of the child or children as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments (ENPs).</P>
      <P>There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. ENPs are paid where a specific need exists regardless of whether the client is homeless.</P>
      <P>ENPs paid to homeless people are not identified separately from other categories of recipients. The main type of exceptional needs payments sought by homeless people are normally for clothing and footwear, deposits for private rented accommodation, replacement of money lost or stolen and for necessary travel.</P>
      <P>Details of expenditure on ENPs in 1998 and 1999 are contained in the following tabular statements. Computerisation of the SWA scheme commenced in 1996 and was completed in six of the eight health boards in December 1997. Comprehensive statistics on ENPs are, therefore, not available for 1997. The total expenditure on ENPs in 1997 was £21.6 million.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the establishment of a social insurance fund board with representation from the social partners will be examined. This examination will begin in the near future.</P>
      <P>One of the issues relevant to the establishment of such a board is the Government decision to part pre-fund social welfare pensions. The nature and role of a social insurance board will, therefore, need to be considered in the context of the legislative arrangements, including supervisory structures, which will be put in place in respect of the new reserve fund. My colleague, the Minister for Finance will be introducing legislative proposals for the setting up of the reserve fund in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination will need to examine the composition of such a board including the role of the <Col N="1348" /> social partners, the existing legal responsibilities of myself, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the fund, and the legal responsibility, if any, a new board will have to be taken into account. Finally, the role of a new board <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Pensions Board given the latter's existing role in providing advice regarding pensions, including those pensions paid from the fund, will also need to be given detailed consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994, to mark the International Year of the Family, an allocation of £250,000 was made available to my Department to fund ten family resource centres on a pilot basis. The decision was motivated by the perception of a possible gap in statutory support for community development activities focused on support for families and tackling child poverty.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the work of these centres was published in 1997, a key recommendation of which was that funding of these centres should be mainstreamed by my Department. The Commission on the Family in its final report recommended that a network of 100 family resource centres be established in the ensuing four to five years. Taking into account the outcome of the review and the recommendations of the Commission on the Family, additional funding of £700,000 was allocated in 1998 to allow the expansion of the programme by some 25 centres. A total sum of £2.13 million was allocated to the programme in 1999 to allow for the expansion of the programme by some 20 centres and a further £2.939 million has been made available in 2000 to allow for the expansion of the programme by some 15 centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Partnership 2000 my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for funding under the community development programme. Research was undertaken to identify the most disadvantaged areas and as a result I approved the inclusion of some 40 new areas in the community development programme. In addition the research identified some 24 priority areas for inclusion in the family and community services resource centre programme and I subsequently approved their inclusion in the programme. The regional support agencies which operate under the community development programme are currently undertaking the necessary pre-development work to establish new centres in the selected areas and it is expected that these <Col N="1349" /> centres will come on-stream in the next six to 18 months.</P>
    <P>My Department has made significant progress towards achieving the goal of 100 centres with some 64 centres currently in receipt of funding or approved in principle for inclusion in the programme at this stage.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the vital role these centres play in providing support for marginalised families and in combating poverty and social exclusion and the commitment to support such initiatives is shown by the significant increase in funding made available to the programme in recent years.</P>
    <P>A sum in excess of £18 million has been made available over the period of the national development plan to support and expand the family and community services resource centre programme and my Department will be working to ensure that this funding is targeted to assist the most disadvantaged communities, with a particular focus on assisting vulnerable and disadvantaged families in those communities.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the consequences of the closure of certain Irish Sea fisheries under the EU sponsored conservation programme.</P>
      <P>In so far as the welfare system is concerned, the fishing assist measures provided for under the unemployment assistance scheme are designed to provide income support to low-income fishing</P>
      <P>families.</P>
      <P>Two key improvements to the means test governing the fishing assist measures are provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, and will take effect from October of this year.</P>
      <P>First, the child-related income disregards are being increased by £100 in each case, from £100 to £200 in respect of each of the first two children and from £200 to £300 in respect of the third and subsequent children. Second, the assessment rate is being reduced from 80% to 70%.</P>
      <P>It is open to those fishing families affected by the closure of the tracts of Irish Sea fisheries under the EU conservation programme to avail of the supports provided under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must appreciate that the role of my Department is to provide income support to all low-income families. While I appreciate the difficulties faced by those families affected, I am not in a position to introduce special additional compensation measures in response to circumstances of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 83 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to set up a working group, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues of developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>Following the recent ratification of the programme, arrangements will be made soon to consult the social partners on the composition and establishment of this working group, including the appointment of the chairperson. My Department will play a leading role in conjunction with other relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>While formal terms of reference for the working group have not been established, the issues to be covered by the group are set out in the programme. These include relative income poverty, as well as the long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI, distributive and incentive issues. These are highly complex issues which will need careful study. The outcome of the work of the group will have a significant impact on future policy in this regard, and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <P>I understand the survey of landlords in the Dublin area to which the Deputy refers suggests that &ldquo;one third of landlords will not let to rent supplement claimants due to their social problems and behaviour&rdquo;. I am concerned that this may reflect prejudice against tenants claiming rent supplement which could lead to people on low incomes finding it very difficult to secure accommodation. However, as a full report arising from the survey will not be published until May or June of this year, it would be premature to engage in discussions with the Irish Property Owners' Association at this time.</P>
      <P>Demand for private rented accommodation is at a very high level in relation to the supply of such accommodation at present, particularly in the Dublin area. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has established a commission on the private rented residential sector. My Department is represented on the commission along with various groups including the Irish Property Owners' Association.</P>
      <P>The commission's report is due in June and will provide a suitable context for engaging in discussions with the Irish Property Owners' Association and addressing the needs of people on low incomes living in the private rented sector.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department does not have specific responsibility to create public awareness and promote cultural diversity. Policy in this area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, my Department was represented on the Interdepartmental Committee on the Integration of Refugees established by Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue which reported earlier this year. The Government has accepted the recommendations made by that committee and arising from that, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Inter-Culturalism is currently carrying out an evaluation exercise on how best to promote respect for cultural diversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, a comprehensive customer service training programme is currently being delivered to all staff in my Department who deal <Col N="1352" /> with the public. One of the key modules focuses on the importance for our staff dealing with the public to adopt a non-discriminatory approach in dealing with all customers, particularly those from minority groups.</P>
    <P>In addition, last December, I launched the community development programme's anti-racism code of practice which is the first of its kind in Ireland. It provides a framework to tackle racism at all levels and challenges other sectors of society to develop policies and codes to eliminate racism.</P>
    <P>The Community Development Association which assisted the African Refugee Network in compiling the report to which the Deputy refers, was funded under my Department's community development programme. It received £93,625 in 1999 and £34,650 in November 1998 towards the cost of office premises. This enabled it to provide office space for the African Refugee Network group.</P>
    <P>The promotion of a tolerant inclusive society is not just a matter for Government. We all have a role to play as individuals and in the various organisations in which we take part.</P>

      <P>Since its introduction in 1993 the back to work allowance scheme has proved to be a very worthwhile initiative in encouraging the long-term unemployed and lone-parents with children to take up employment and self-employment opportunities. The primary objective of the scheme is to encourage recipients of specified long-term welfare payments to seek employment. Since 1993 eligibility for the allowance has been extended on a number of occasions. It is now available to recipients of disability allowance, blind person's pension and to former recipients of carer's allowance. From September it will be further extended to recipients of invalidity pension and unemployability supplement.</P>
      <P>It is not currently available to recipients of deserted wife's allowance. However a review of the scheme will shortly commence in my Department and the issue of further widening the eligibility categories will be considered in the context of that review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 321 and 328 together.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made over the past decade or so, in addressing certain anomalies in the qualifying conditions for old age (contributory) and retirement pensions.</P>
      <P>Most recently, in April 1999, I introduced a special old age (contributory) pension for certain self-employed people who were over 56 on 6 April 1988 &ndash; when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced &ndash; and in this year's Social Welfare Act, I have provided for a special pension which gives further recognition to contributions paid prior to 1953.</P>
      <P>To qualify for either of these payments, a person must have paid a minimum of 260 contributions, or five years. These special arrangements represent, I believe, a sympathetic response to the predicament of some people who could not qualify for a pension in accordance with the standard qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to expect a person to attain a certain level of contributions over their working career in order to qualify for a contributory-based pension. From an equity perspective, a certain contribution threshold must apply. This not only upholds the social insurance principle, firmly supported by successive Governments, but also affirms the expectations and entitlements of those who have a history of strong attachment to social insurance.</P>
      <P>My Department has been reviewing the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) and retirement pensions. The Department is, at present, finalising a report on the first phase of this review process and I expect to receive this very shortly. I have already confirmed to the House on a number of occasions that when the report has been considered by the Government, I will report to the House at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the latest published monthly CSO report on the consumer price index highlights that in the year to February 2000 inflation increased by 4.3%, the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement has estimated that the annual average inflation rate for the whole of 2000 will be 3%.</P>
      <P>The recent social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £428 million on a full year basis, provides for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66, a special increase of £5.90 a week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66.</P>
      <P>The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%. With an expected annual average inflation rate of 3% for 2000, this year's increases will be ahead of expected inflation, representing real increases ranging between 2.1% and 5.7%.</P>
      <P>In addition, special increases in the rate of qualified adult allowances are being provided for this year, as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate by 2002. These increases, which range between 7.7% and 17.2%, represent real increases of between 4.6% and 13.8%.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all of these increases are being paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed in its action programme to providing substantial social welfare increases. Specifically, the recent review of the action programme has committed the Government to bringing forward from 2002 the target date for increasing the old age contributory pension to £100 a week and to extending the commitment to achieving this target rate to all social welfare pensions for older people by 2002. The Government is also committed to ensuring that over its term of office all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government has entered into a number of social inclusion commitments with the social partners. This programme provides that over the period up to 2003, all social welfare rates will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target <Col N="1355" /> child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements are already in place to help people who work in the home to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>From 6 April 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six &ndash; increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995 &ndash; or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age (contributory) pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way. Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the new pro-rata pensions which I introduced in November 1997 will be of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in this area. As part of the review of the existing arrangements for homemakers, to be undertaken later this year by my Department, and which will form part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory pensions, I have asked that proposals be brought forward for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting last week with a delegation from the &ldquo;Childcare 2000&rdquo; cam<Col N="1356" /> paign. At that meeting, the delegation set out their proposal for payment of a parent's childcare payment (PCP) to parents. This would be paid to parents, whether in paid work or caring for children in the home, at the rate of £20 per child per week if the child is aged 0 to 5, and £10 per child per week if the child is aged 6 to 14. The group also propose that the payment would be taxable.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that such a payment would cost some £569 million annually, in gross terms. If it were taxed, the net cost would be in the region of £455 million.</P>
      <P>Apart from the cost, I would also be concerned at the drop in income arising at ages five and 14. While I accept that certain costs such as child care costs, fall as children get older, other costs, like food, clothing and education expense, increase as the child gets older. I would be particularly concerned at the effect on larger low income families of a drop in child income support as the children get older.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that in the recent Social Welfare Act I increased child benefit substantially, by £8 per month in respect of the lower rate and £10 per month on the higher rate. The full year cost of this is £106 million in full year terms. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I am committed to substantially increasing child benefit over the period of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>The programme also provides that, following a completion process with the social partners, the Government will adopt a strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs. I would expect the proposal for a parents child care payment to be addressed in the context of that process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this report prepared by the ESRI for the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which was made available last November. Wide-ranging in its scope, the report examines the causal effects of poverty and social deprivation among older people through a variety of <Col N="1357" /> dimensions and, as such, it is a valuable addition to the body of research on issues relating to the needs of our older people. It covers the period from 1987 to 1997 and therefore provides an informative, historical analysis for policy makers.</P>
    <P>As the report points out, in income terms the position of older people disimproved over the ten year period covered. This is precisely why, on taking up office, this Government set ambitious goals in order to secure the future of our older people. An Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of £100 by 2002. We are well on the way to achieving this with record increases in pensions rates over the last three budgets.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension at £78 per week equated to 28 per cent of average industrial earnings. From next month, at £96.00 per week it will equate to over 30% which is working towards the 34 per cent recommendation of the Pensions Board in its report Securing Retirement Income.</P>
    <P>In last year's review of the programme, this Government committed to the early achievement of the £100 commitment and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions by 2002. In addition, over the lifetime of this Government, all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People report acknowledges the important role that the free schemes play in supporting the more vulnerable of our older people. From October this year, I have provided that entitlement to the free schemes will be extended to all people over 75 years of age regardless of the household income or composition. In this regard, I am pleased to inform Deputies that the Review of the Free Schemes is being published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, today and I will be launching this review later this evening. I have arranged that a copy of the report will be made available to Members of both Houses this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I will examine this report in detail in the context of future budgetary policy. In particular, I intend to build on the improvements in this area by moving towards the establishment of a single household benefits scheme in future budgets. This will amalgamate the free electricity, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance into one combined household benefits package based on the standard living alone qualifying criteria.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides an opportunity to develop new approaches with the social partners to important strategic issues that were being considered in the social inclusion area.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy is the Government's key policy document in relation to tackling poverty and social exclusion and it is proposed, under the programme, that the national anti-poverty strategy will be updated and the underlying methodology reviewed and revised where appropriate. In particular, new targets will <Col N="1358" /> be considered under the themes of older people, women's poverty, child poverty, health and housing and accommodation. This process will be completed during the first 18 months of the programme. In addition, the issue of relative income poverty will be reviewed by a working group to be established to examine benchmarking and indexation issues.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme will operate this year from 1 June to 30 September during which approved students will be allowed to undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour, giving a total maximum payment of £600. The scheme was advertised in the national newspapers on 5 April last.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of the scheme again this year will be to provide financial help to less well-off third level students who are unable to get full time summer work and who are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period.</P>
      <P>The work done under the scheme is of a community nature and does not equate with normal commercial type employment. The scheme does not therefore fall within the scope of the national minimum wage legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to increase the rate of pay under the scheme. Due to the buoyant economic situation in recent years there are increased opportunities for employment in the open labour market during the summer months and a heavy demand for labour. It is important that students are encouraged to avail of the opportunities which now exist and the need to have recourse to this scheme is reducing. An increase in the rate of pay for the scheme could affect participation by well educated and highly employable students in the open labour market thereby further exacerbating a tightening labour market situation. In current circumstances there is no justification for an increase in the rates of pay under the scheme.</P>

      <P>For the third year in a row since this Government took office, significant extra resources, this year amounting to some £10 million, have been provided for the development of family services in my Department. This compares to £1.5 million in 1997. Major improvement in family services which I have introduced include:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ndash;A record £3.75 million this year for voluntary organisations providing marriage and child counselling services and bereavement counselling and support services. This is more than four times the amount provided in 1997. Some 400 voluntary groups have applied for grant funding this year. Applications are being processed at present in my Department.</P>
      <P>&ndash;The nationwide family mediation service as promised in the Action Programme for the Millennium is now in place. The service is now available from centres in Cork, Tralee, Wexford, Athlone, Dundalk, Galway, Tallaght in west Dublin and Castlebar in addition to the Limerick centre and the Dublin centre which has been relocated to larger premises to deal with more clients. Last year more than 1,000 couples were assisted by the service. I now plan to establish the service on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>&ndash;Some 56 centres are now either up and running or in the process of being set up under the family and community services resource centre programme, under which ten centres were being funded at the beginning of 1998. The target is 100 over the coming years. This year some £3 million has been  allocated to develop the programme.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a families research programme to help shape the development of family policy and services in the future. A feasibility study into what would be involved in undertaking a national longitudinal study of children in Ireland is to be undertaken by my Department jointly with the Department of Health and Children. I expect to make an announcement about the commencement of the project in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Family services projects providing high quality information about the range of supports available <Col N="1360" /> to families from State agencies and from the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on services available locally are being piloted in three local offices of my Department &ndash; Cork, Waterford and Finglas in Dublin. The Government has allocated £12 million in the national development plan for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the programme over the period 2000-06.</P>
    <P>More than 1000 people from local voluntary groups that work with families have attended family service information fora which I have held throughout the country. The fora provide an opportunity to discuss the findings of the commission on the family and the needs of local communities in supporting families.</P>
    <P>Government priorities to radically improve provision for pensioners, carers and dependent spouses and children in households on low incomes address areas highlighted by the commission in its report. The £428 million budget package for social welfare increases this year includes significant improvements in all rates of payment for pensioners, monthly increases in child benefit of £8 per child for the first and second child and £10 for subsequent children and a new carers benefit to enable carers to give up work temporarily to provide care full time while still retaining their employment rights.</P>
    <P>The overall package provides in addition for increases of over 5% in other payments, improvements in employment supports, in the means test and in the free schemes for carers and a new widowed parents grant of £1,000 &ndash; in all a radical and innovative package to improve the position of those who are most vulnerable in society and to support families in carrying out their essential caring responsibilities for children and other dependent family members.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are progressing a number of significant policy issues in their own areas of responsibility in line with the Government's pro-families approach. The Minister for Education and Science has a number of initiatives under way in relation to early education, investment at primary level in schools and in tackling educational disadvantage. The Minister for Health and Children has announced proposals for a national children's strategy to support the delivery of an integrated childcare policy. Progress has been made in relation to the introduction of parental leave and investment in childcare projects in disadvantaged communities. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government and social partners are committed to support family life, offer choices for families and equal opportunities for both men and women to play an active caring role in families through a range of measures to address childcare needs and promote the adoption of family friendly work practices and policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>The community development support programmes were included in the national development plan with a commitment of over £100 million over the lifetime of the plan, this figure rises to £110 million when budget commitments are included. These programmes focus on investment in capacity building, so that socially excluded groups and local communities can be active participants in identifying and meeting their own development needs, working alongside the other social partners.</P>
      <P>Applications from groups seeking inclusion in these programmes are assessed by an independent technical group established to advise me on the selection of new areas and groups for funding.</P>
      <P>Applications must fulfil the following criteria for inclusion in the programmes. They must have a commitment to an anti-poverty focus; provide support and act as a catalyst for community development activity; act as a resource in the communities of which they are a part; promote co-ordination and co-operation between community, voluntary and statutory groups in the area; involve local people drawn from groups who themselves experience poverty and social exclusion within their management structures; demonstrate a commitment, in principle and practice, to operate from an equality perspective.</P>
      <P>Some 90 projects are currently participating in the community development programme and an additional 40 projects will come on stream over the next 18 months. At present, 61 centres are</P>
      <P>being funded or have been approved in principle for funding under the family and community services resource centre programme. It is expected that a further 15 centres will be established by the end of 2000. In addition, funding for a further ten groups under the core funded community and family support groups programme has been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing priorities for the expansion of these support programmes, the technical group first gathered baseline information. In this regard the technical group had a report &ldquo;Targeting Disadvantage under the Community Development Programme&rdquo; which was commissioned at its request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The report rearranged all areas of the State by reference to comparative disadvantage. Further information gathering, at regional level, was undertaken by the regional support agencies. In addition the establishment of new projects in rural areas has been identified as a priority. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fair<Col N="1363" /> ness there is a commitment that the number of projects will continue to be expanded in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The current expansion of the programmes is a significant undertaking for my Department and once the new projects are up and running the technical group will be revisiting priority needs for the future expansion of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that research will be carried out in a number of key areas, including poverty, health, education and training. In relation to the monitoring and evaluation of poverty, further research to determine the extent and causes of poverty will be carried out and systems of measuring poverty among groups not currently included will also be examined, e.g. people living in institutions, Travellers and the homeless. The programme also provides for new studies to complement the current Living in Ireland and Household Budget Surveys, and to address the gender dimensions of poverty.</P>
    <P>In the areas of health, education and training, the Central Statistics Office, the Equality Authority and relevant Departments will develop a system for the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data for women and, in relation to health, education and training, for Travellers.</P>
    <P>In addition, resources are to be allocated to health research as part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring adequate medium and long-term planning of health provision. Data systems will be adapted to enable disaggregation of health access and outcomes across the national anti-poverty strategy (NAPS) target groups.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the above research will help to inform the targeting of funding at areas of high deprivation.</P>

      <P>Pilot projects to enhance information services for families are under way in three local offices of my Department &ndash; Waterford, Cork and Finglas in Dublin. The projects build on the one-stop shop concept with the aim of providing improved access to information for families through the social welfare local offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective of the family services project is to provide a high quality information service about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and from the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on the services available locally. The expanded range of family services on which information is available includes marriage counselling and marriage preparation programmes, bereavement <Col N="1364" /> counselling and support services, information about parenting issues, including local childcare services where this information is available, and the State family mediation service. The latest information technology will be used to support the family services project.</P>
    <P>Within the pilot project an enhanced programme of support is being offered to a small group of customers with complex needs, for example, very young lone mothers, other parents rearing children without the support of a partner and dependent spouses in households with children depending on social welfare payments. It is hoped that the additional support involving individual attention, customised information and enhanced access &ndash; an appointment is set up where this is possible &ndash; to services and supports which would assist the family will enhance the capacity of those in the most difficult family circumstances to improve their personal situations.</P>
    <P>The family services project is the subject of ongoing evaluation during the pilot phase which will continue throughout this year. The evaluation will identify the resource and management issues to be addressed in the provision of this family focused service, assess its effectiveness in meeting the needs of families and its potential to improve local co-ordination of community support for families. The outcome of the evaluation will inform proposals for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the pilot programme over the period 2000-06 for which the Government has provided £12 million in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The project draws on the Government's &ldquo;pro-families&rdquo; approach to the development of policies and services for families, the recommendations of the Commission on the Family, and the strategy statement of my Department which commits the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to promote policies which protect and support families including the development of service delivery to address the different needs of customers and the creation of stronger links with partner agencies and voluntary organisations at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or whenever the capital was moved from one investment option into another.</P>
      <P>Under the current assessment method, the first £2000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5% and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, following a review undertaken by my Department last year, I have made provision in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, for the introduction of a new assessment method from October of this year. This new method will be applied to all social assistance schemes, other than supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>Under the new method the first £10,000 of capital will be disregarded; capital between £10,000 and £20,000 will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; and capital above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the results of a recent sample survey, some 94,000 old age non-contributory pensioners &ndash;  over 98% &ndash; have no capital or have insufficient capital to be assessed with means under the new arrangements. The limited information available on the number of recipients of other social assistance schemes with capital would suggest that most of these would have amounts <Col N="1366" /> below £10,000. Therefore, the majority of social assistance recipients who have capital will not be assessed with any means because of that capital.</P>
    <P>The new system continues with the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>

      <P>I have been very conscious of the need to have extensive consultation so that the forthcoming White Paper properly and adequately reflects the issues that are of real importance to the sector and that there is genuine consultation in this regard. The consultation process with the voluntary and community sector provided for a three phased approach. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The final phase provided for a national seminar to which people were invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their discussion papers.</P>
      <P>The consultation process culminated at a national seminar which was held on 30 March 2000. The national seminar provided the opportunity for people who were involved in the initial phases to respond to the issues addressed in four discussion papers presented on behalf of the relevant Departments involved in the process. My Department is currently revising the discussion papers to take account of observations made by delegates at the seminar and written submissions received from individuals/groups following the seminar. When this is complete, I will finalise my proposals for submission to Government with a view to publishing the White Paper at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is provided in the following statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lower and higher child benefit rates have <Col N="1367" /> been increased nominally over the last six budgets by 113% and 124% respectively to £42.50 and £56. These amount to real increases of 88% and 98% when account is taken of the increase in the C.P.I. over this period.</P>
    <P>By 1997, after the first three budgets in this period, the cumulative increases were nominally 50% and 56% respectively or 42% and 48% in real terms.</P>
    <P>The view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty and targeting child income support is widely acknowledged. Child benefit is a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, and does not con<Col N="1368" /> tribute therefore to disincentives to taking up employment or to improving wages.</P>
    <P>The value placed by successive Governments on child benefit is reflected in the level of resources invested in the scheme over the period shown. Most notably, the 2000 budget provides for a full year investment of almost £106 million, bringing the total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the value of the child benefit scheme will continue to be exploited to the greatest possible extent. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment that child benefit will be substantially increased over the period of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has for the introduction of a fully inclusive social insurance model which would facilitate combining work and family responsibilities in the context of changing working and social patterns in accordance with a commitment given in Framework 3 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to establish a working group to produce proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social insurance model which would facilitate combining work and family responsibilities in the context of a changing work environment. This is one of a number of commitments in the programme in relation to examining different aspects of the social insurance system, and I will be looking at how to phase these different projects over the duration of the programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have asked my Department to bring forward proposals in relation to pensions for women who have taken time out from work because of caring responsibilities in the home.</P>
      <P>The social insurance system already has a number of features which enable people to combine work and family responsibilities. There are some benefits which assist people in combining work and family responsibilities. Maternity benefit has been part of the system since its inception. Adoptive benefit was introduced in April 1995. In the Social Welfare Act recently passed by the Oireachtas I have introduced a new benefit which develops this area further &ndash; carer's benefit. The new benefit, which will come into operation next October, will enable those workers who take time out to care for ill or incapacitated persons to receive a social insurance payment.</P>
      <P>This is an innovative development of the social insurance system as it introduces cover for a contingency which was not covered to date. Carer's benefit, allied with the proposed statutory carer's leave entitlements, will therefore enable workers to combine their working requirements with their responsibilities to care for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards contributions, a number of arrangements are already in place which cater for the position of former contributors who have had to leave the workforce for homemaking purposes. Former contributors can opt to pay voluntary contributions. These contributions provide continuing cover for the pensions which the employee or self employed contributor was covered for when working. There are also special arrangements for homemakers which enable persons who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From April 1994, contribution years spent out of the workforce caring for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded for the purpose of establishing the <Col N="1369" /> yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years can be disregarded in this way.</P>
    <P>I will consider proposals for the further development of the social insurance system in the light of the recommendations of the working group to be established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>A representation dated 11 February 2000 from SIPTU who represent some of the community welfare officers of the health boards was received by my Department highlighting their concerns regarding the plan to set up a new agency to deal with asylum seekers under the programme of direct provision. In their representation SIPTU stated that they believe asylum seekers are entitled to a level of service equal to all other groups and felt that direct provision is discriminatory.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to disperse asylum seekers throughout the country due to a shortage of accommodation in the Dublin area and then to introduce direct provision to cater for their needs.</P>
      <P>The directorate for asylum support services was established under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to manage services for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment is made in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation. Where a person in full board accommodation receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per <Col N="1370" /> child. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments (ENP), will be made by the health board.</P>
    <P>These points were included in my Department's response to SIPTU's representation. Officials from my Department also met SIPTU and IMPACT representatives on 16 February 2000 to discuss the issues raised in SIPTU's letter.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that I intend to set up a working group comprising representatives from relevant Departments to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for SWA purposes. These include the level of SWA which should be paid to people who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs. The circumstances in which people claiming SWA rent supplement should be refused on the grounds that they are not in need of accommodation will also be examined. The group will recommend any legislative or administrative changes that may be required to maximise fairness, equity, transparency and efficiency in this area.</P>
    <P>The working group will also consult with interested parties including the unions representing community welfare service staff.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been no recent changes in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme affecting discretionary payments for urgent family emergencies. These exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs) continue to made on the same basis as heretofore and I have no plans to change the current arrangements.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have made provision in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to allow my Department to make certain SWA payments in cases where the person concerned is already being dealt with by my Department and where it is appropriate to do so. This may happen, for example, where a person claims unemployment assistance, they have insufficient or no income to meet their basic needs but unemployment assistance cannot be put into payment immediately. The provisions of the Act will enable my Department to make SWA payments in such cases, thus avoiding the necessity for the people concerned to make their case &ldquo;in duplicate&rdquo; at the health board office when they will have already provided all the relevant details to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These new arrangements will lead to better customer service and improved efficiency. The <Col N="1371" /> necessary measures to give effect to the provisions are in course of preparation and discussions with the trade unions involved will take place in order to address any concerns they may have in relation to these changes. In the meantime, pending finalisation of the new arrangements, the health boards will continue to make all payments under SWA in the normal manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In July last year, the Government approved my proposal for an initiative to integrate public services. This initiative &ndash; known as REACH &ndash; will use the personal public services number and an associated public services card to integrate services to citizens across the whole public service. One of the principal objectives of REACH is to increase the use of the personal public service number &ndash; or PPS number &ndash; by citizens and public service agencies.</P>
      <P>Another important objective is the development of a public services card for use by citizens in accessing public services. Taken together, the personal number and the card will enable the integration of services across agencies and will result in a much better level of service for citizens.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have used the RSI number, now called the personal public services number, for many years as a unique personal identifier to help in the administration of tax and social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>Legislative provisions to permit its use across the public service have been introduced under the Social Welfare Acts of 1998 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Customers of my Department have used the social services card for many years to draw down payments at post offices and to help in conducting transactions relating to income support schemes.</P>
      <P>The public service card will be developed from this base as a multi-purpose card with a wide variety of uses.</P>
      <P>The REACH initiative will engage in a wide ranging consultation to establish citizens' requirements for such a card and to decide on its form and the range of its uses. I cannot predict what the outcome of this process will be, but I am particularly concerned that the card will support electronic access to information systems and services, and that it will give the citizen maximum control and security over his or her personal data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned that the citizen will have <Col N="1372" /> the maximum level of trust in the new system, especially as to the privacy and protection of personal information. Citizens' personal information required for the administration of public services is protected by law under the provisions of the Data Protection Act. Sharing of personal information by public bodies may take place only with the consent of the individual concerned and where allowed by law.</P>
    <P>These safeguards to personal privacy will underpin the development of the modern integrated services envisaged under REACH.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to lower the qualifying age for receipt of old age non-contributory pensions, which currently stands at 66 years.</P>
      <P>Any reduction in this qualifying age would have major financial implications, and would not make good policy sense, especially in the light of future demographic projections.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that a reduction of one year in the qualifying age for old age non-contributory pensions, including knock-on effects to other social welfare schemes would cost in the region of £52 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme (JI) is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of the programme is to progress participants into mainstream employment. The first phase of participants have completed their term and are now availing of a six month extension in order to address any training or development needs they may have, and to allow time for the local employment service to engage more actively with them to facilitate their progression to employment in the open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent review of the operation of the JI programme by Deloitte &amp; Touche, recommended that the eligibility criteria for the programme remain unchanged. My Department has consulted with the social partners on this issue and there is broad agreement that the focus of the programme on the older long-term unemployed should remain unchanged. The programme will have an increased emphasis on progression to employment in the open labour market. However, there is some need for flexibility in defining what constitutes progression and the <Col N="1391" /> pace at which it can occur. Different options will be appropriate depending on individual circumstances. Therefore, as recommended by the consultants, it is likely that some roll-over will be necessary to facilitate overall progression.</P>
    <P>The consultation process will be completed shortly at which point new guidelines will be issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>I have recently met representatives of the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance at their request in regard to a number of issues which are of concern to them.</P>
      <P>The alliance raised issues related to quarry owners who had lost their business as a result of practices in the quarry and concrete business which they considered to be unfair and to constitute an abuse of a monopoly position. It expressed the view that the Competition Authority was not able to investigate this issue properly due to lack of resources. The alliance also expressed particular concern about the beneficial ownership of a number of companies.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing inquiries about the exercise of beneficial ownership in the cases identified. I will be in contact with the alliance again when the issues raised in its submission to me have been fully considered.</P>
      <P>In the area of competition, competition law in Ireland is governed by the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Act was enacted in 1991 and it prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position. The Act applies to undertakings, an undertaking being defined as a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for <Col N="1392" /> gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, set out the rules of competition.</P>
    <P>In regard to remedies for anti-competitive behaviour, section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief, by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, contains offences and penalties provisions for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act. In addition it provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition and a Director of Competition Enforcement was appointed in order to give effect to those public enforcement provisions.</P>
    <P>There are therefore two alternative ways of pursuing allegations of breaches of competition rules:</P>
    <P>(i) take civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or,</P>
    <P>(ii) make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate the alleged breach</P>
    <P>In regard to resources, I recently announced the appointment of a new chairman and member in the Competition Authority and other appointments, both at professional and non-professional level, will follow. In addition, my Department, together with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study of the authority's operations with a view to assessing the authority's future resource requirements. I am fully committed to ensuring that the authority is adequately resourced to discharge its important statutory functions and I will speedily address any resource deficiency identified in the study when the report is to hand.</P>

      <P>FÁS has operational responsibility for the delivery of the community employment (CE) programme, including project selection and appraisal. Schools have not been excluded from participating in CE as a consequence of the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure the programme. An audit of CE <Col N="1393" /> projects undertaken in November 1999 shows that there were 5,804 persons participating in CE projects in schools at that time.</P>
      <P>It is the case however that discussions have been taking place between my Department and the Department of Education and Science with a view to determining the potential to mainstream services currently provided for the education sector through CE (e.g. school secretaries, caretakers etc.) directly by the education sector itself. Any developments arising from these discussions will also be the subject of consultation with the social partners as provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the particular difficulties faced by the Border, midlands and west regions and of the approach last year from the Cavan Partnership to my Department in relation to the provision of a local employment service LES for Cavan.</P>
      <P>The Government decided last year to implement new operational arrangements for the management, development and delivery of the national employment service function, including the assimilation of the LES, under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual stranded national employment service &ndash; the other component being the existing FÁS employment service. Any future decisions about the development or expansion of the employment services function in any area will be taken by FÁS on the basis of an integrated assessment of the needs of that area relative to prevailing labour market conditions and current service provision.</P>

      <P>In line with the aims of the strategic management initiative to <Col N="1394" /> deliver better Government, the policy of my Department is to increase rather than restrict the time available to take calls from the public. To this end, a dedicated central information and communications unit has been in operation in the Department since July 1998. The unit is available to take calls from the public between 09.15 and 17.30 Monday to Friday.</P>
      <P>A separate information unit is also operating in the employment rights division of my Department. This unit provides a dedicated telephone information service to the public in relation to employee rights-entitlements under employment legislation. The service is provided continuously during regular office hours but where special circumstances arise as, for example, when new legislation is introduced extended hours of service are provided through a combination of overtime work and the temporary assignment of additional staffing resources to the unit.</P>
      <P>A voicemail facility has also been in place in my Department since 1994. All officials who have contact with the public have been instructed to make use of this facility to ensure public access should they be absent from the office. A LoCall facility is also available in the Department.</P>
      <P>For those of our customers with internet access, the Department can be contacted seven days a week without any time restriction. The worldwide web address is www.irlgov.ie/entemp and this is published in my Department's FOI manual and other publications emanating from the Department.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious of the progress made to enhance service to our customers, I am aware that there is always room for improvement in this regard. In the framework of the strategic management initiative in general and the interdepartmental quality customer service group in particular, my officials are actively examining ways in which the overall aim of enhanced customer service delivery can be achieved.</P>

There are also certain sea fishing boat licences which entitle the holder to fish only for bivalve molluscs.</P>
      <P>My Department announced last year that no further applications would be accepted, until further notice, for sea fishing boat licences authorising the holder to fish only for bivalve molluscs. This decision was taken to ensure an appropriate balance between the level of fishing activity and the available fishing opportunities, in the interests of the conservation and rational exploitation of the fish stocks concerned. Any licences granted before this announcement are not affected.</P>
      <P>Sea fishing boat licences are granted to a named person in respect of a particular boat and are not transferable. If a fishing boat changes hands, the new owner would have to apply for a licence in accordance with the normal rules and criteria of licensing policy.</P>

The decision to restrict these services was widely advertised in the national and industry media. Staff gave direct dial telephone numbers to customers during this period and inward calls from the public to such telephone numbers were answered in the normal manner. Following the elimination of the backlog and the introduction of better systems to assist staff in processing grants and premia payments, full telephone services were restored in March this year.</P>

      <P>The Cologne European Council decided that a body, now known as the convention, comprised of representatives of the Heads of State and Government, of the President of the Commission and of the European Parliament and national parliaments, should be established to elaborate a draft charter of fundamental rights. The convention has been tasked to present a draft in advance of the December 2000 European Council. The convention has been meeting regularly, in both formal and informal sessions, to discuss elements for inclusion in the draft charter. The Taoiseach's representative at the convention, Deputy O'Kennedy, along with his alternate, has kept the Government fully informed about the discussions.</P>
      <P>The large and disparate membership of the convention has resulted in the expression of a wide range of views and approaches in regard to the proposed charter. One of the fundamental issues which has yet to be resolved in the convention is the scope of the application of the charter, whether in respect of the Union only, and in respect of all or only some of its activities, or in respect of the member states also. It is important in this context to note that the Convention is tasked with formulating a draft charter; it will be for the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in December 2000 to approve the draft.</P>
      <P>The Government has indicated a preference for the charter to take the form of a political declaration rather than a legally binding text.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it was agreed at the Cologne European Council in June 1999 to convene an intergovernmental conference in 2000 with a mandate to examine changes to the European institutions necessary for enlargement, including the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the council. Ireland fully supports efforts to ensure that the Union is equipped to cope with the demands posed by enlargement, while maintaining the necessary balances. Like other small member states, Ireland has a particular interest in the effective functioning of the <Col N="1402" /> Union and its institutions, including in the context of a potentially significant increase in the number of members.</P>
      <P>With regard to qualified majority voting &ndash; QMV &ndash; the position under the current treaties is that it already applies to a very sizeable portion of the work of the council. Our experience to date has been that the operation of qualified majority voting has been generally helpful to Irish interests, and has facilitated the adoption of measures which were beneficial from an Irish perspective. We are also conscious that in an enlarged Union the prospect of another state blocking decisions of interest to us is inevitably increased.</P>
      <P>The approach taken thus far in the Intergovernmental Conference discussions is to identify the various articles, organised by categories, where unanimity currently applies, and which might be considered for transfer to qualified majority voting. The articles cover a broad range of areas, including the environment, social provisions, international agreements and financial issues. The discussions are inevitably are at a preliminary stage, and without prejudice to the final outcome, which requires the agreement of all member states.</P>
      <P>Progress in the Intergovernmental Conference was reviewed at yesterday's ministerial meeting which I attended. I availed of the opportunity to reiterate our willingness to examine positively the scope for extension of QMV, examining each area on a case by case basis. It will be recalled that at Amsterdam, Ireland, with others, was prepared to agree to a further extension of the list of issues in the First Pillar area subject to QMV, but, in the end, agreement did not prove possible. However, we have also indicated that in relation to, for example, certain constitutional issues, decisions should continue to be taken on the basis of unanimity. At the ministerial meeting, I also made clear our view that unanimity remains appropriate in the taxation area.</P>
      <P>As regards the eventual outcome of the conference, given the exploratory character of the discussions to date, and the fact that decisions on QMV are likely to be part of an overall package covering the full Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is at this point difficult to predict the likely shape of the final agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>At their annual meeting in September 1999 the World Bank-IMF agreed on extensive revisions to the original &ndash; 1996 &ndash; HIPC Initiative on debt <Col N="1403" /> relief. These reforms ease the conditions under which debt relief is granted. They strengthen the relationship between debt relief and poverty alleviation. In this respect, the enhanced HIPC reflects one of the central points raised in Ireland's own national submission to the HIPC review, i.e. the resources freed by debt relief should be of direct benefit to those in the greatest need.</P>
      <P>Under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, debt repayments by countries which have undertaken economic reforms should fall to a level which is sustainable and which do not deflect scarce resources from important social sectors such as health and education. It is hoped that by the end of 2000 almost 30 of the 40 HIPC countries should have qualified for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC.</P>
      <P>Ireland, which was critical of the original HIPC Initiative, sees the enhanced HIPC as a significant advance on its predecessor and an important step forward in tackling debt. In February 2000 the first HIPC's to receive debt relief under the enhanced initiative were approved by the World Bank and IMF. Bolivia, Uganda and Mauritania were each judged to have met the criteria for relief and will receive a total of $3.7 billion in debt service relief over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
      <P>In the last week, debt relief for Tanzania and Mozambique, two of Ireland's priority countries, has also been approved under the enhanced HIPC. The IMF and IDA will start providing interim debt relief in April. The enhanced HIPC Initiative will help Tanzania and Mozambique to advance their poverty reduction programs and stimulate economic growth. In the case of Mozambique, the front loading of debt relief will release funds to assist in reconstruction after the recent severe floods.</P>
      <P>In parallel with these developments, a number of major bilateral creditors, UK, Italy, France and Germany, have said they will write off most or all of their bilateral credits to countries meeting the criteria for relief under the HIPC.</P>
      <P>Although the HIPC Initiative is beginning to take effect, progress is slower than might have been hoped. Only five countries out of a total of forty eligible candidates have qualified thus far. Part of the problem stems from insufficient funding for the new initiative. For its part, the EU has agreed to contribute 1 billion euros to debt relief and the HIPC Initiative. Ireland's share of this will about 6 million euros. This is in addition to the £31 million which we have already mobilised to help relieve the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to monitor progress under the HIPC and use its influence to press for a just and comprehensive long-term solution to the debt problem in the developing world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous studies have shown that the economics of using rapid rotation forestry for electricity generation are extremely poor, rendering the cost of such electricity very high. Furthermore, if it was decided to pursue this fuel option, which is unlikely in the light of the economics, it would be preferable to construct new plant. Conversion of existing peat plant would be very expensive and not suitable from the point of view of generating efficiency. In this regard, in the liberalised electricity market the question of new plant proposals is no longer the exclusive preserve of the ESB.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, I have set high targets for renewable energy in the future and I have set up a strategy group to advise on their attainment. Realistically, renewable energy technologies will have to compete for available support in terms of public service obligation &ndash; PSO &ndash; levies or seek market share in the liberalised green electricity market where premium prices may be available in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been monitoring scientific research on this subject in various countries for several years and will continue to do so. In view of the fact that the weight of scientific evidence from such research does not support the views expressed by the University of North Caro<Col N="1405" /> lina researchers, I have no plans to initiate the study Deputy Allen seeks.</P>
      <P>To be more specific, the research to which the Deputy refers was undertaken by epidemiologists and statisticians at the University of North Carolina and was published recently in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. The health and mortality of a cohort of 138,905 male electricity utility workers was examined. Among this cohort there were 536 deaths from suicide. The study found that there were more suicides than expected among electricians but fewer than expected among power station operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Carolina study is the eleventh epidemiological study published since 1980 concerned with the potential association between electromagnetic field exposure and depression and suicide. Of the ten previous studies, three of which were undertaken in the United States, five in the United Kingdom, one in Canada and one in Denmark, nine provided no persuasive evidence for an association between electromagnetic field exposure and depression or suicide. In fact, in an earlier study published in 1995 of the same 138,905 workers, the researchers from North Carolina found that the overall mortality of the <Col N="1406" /> cohort was some 23% less than that of the overall US male population.</P>
    <P>More recently in 1997 the National Academy of Science in the United States reported to Congress on the health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields and concluded that the epidemiological evidence does not support an association with neurobehavioural disorders such as depression and suicide. The following year the US National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, addressing the same question, stated that there was inadequate evidence to support the view that occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields caused suicide or depression.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I submitted the Warburg Dillon Read-AIB report on the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta to my Cabinet colleagues at the Government meeting on 1 February and also made it publicly available. I have met and consulted with staff and union representatives of the airports to hear their views and concerns regarding the future of the Aer Rianta Group.</P>

No decisions on possible alternative ownership arrangements for the State airports will be taken in advance of the Government's consideration of these issues.</P>

      <P>The national development plan contains a contingency provision of £500 million for the underground element of the light rail project and the longer term suburban rail development programme.</P>
      <P>The geotechnical study on the underground section of Luas was recently completed. The strategic rail study, which addresses the longer term development of the suburban rail network, has just been finalised. These studies and the strategic phase of the bus network review provide important inputs into the work of the Dublin Transportation Office in preparing an updated transportation strategy for the period up to 2016. The work of the DTO will be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships at its forthcoming meetings.</P>
      <P>When the Government has considered the DTO recommendations and the findings of the studies referred to, it will then be in a position to decide on an updated longer term transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area and on the principal projects and investment priorities flowing from that strategic decision.</P>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that the Government will provide any additional resources required to implement the recommendations of these studies. However, the first priority is to ensure the effective expenditure of the £1.6 billion already allocated to public transport and traffic management in the greater Dublin area for the period 2000 to 2016.</P>

      <P>My intention in my speech to Ballinasloe Chamber of Commerce was to begin a constructive debate about the regulatory and institutional arrangements for the provision of public transport services.</P>
      <P>Recent unprecedented economic growth has given rise to pressure on infrastructural capacity, including that of the public transport system. Tackling congestion is now a major policy challenge. The Government's investment response to this challenge is set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which provides for a radical increase in capital expenditure on public transport.</P>
      <P>Following my success in getting Government approval to accelerated capital investment, I have gone on to review the existing regulatory framework and institutional arrangements for public transport. I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly, following consultation with the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnerships. It is likely that any proposals for regulatory or institutional change will involve the enactment of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to the steering group on the review of the Naval Service and Air Corps was adopted by Government in July 1998. This report set out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. It was recognised that some of these recommendations could be <Col N="1411" /> proceeded with fairly quickly while others would take longer to implement. It is important that the recommendations be implemented in a structured and coherent way that contributes to the overall development of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, I directed the chief of staff to arrange for the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit an implementation plan that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. A draft implementation plan for the Naval Service was submitted to me towards the end of last year. After careful consideration, I decided that additional work needed to be done to augment this plan. I am looking forward to receiving a revised draft plan from the Chief of Staff so that I can advance the process. This plan should, among other things, develop new approaches to ensure that Naval Service vessels maximise the number of days on patrol.</P>
      <P>As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in both the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and the taxpayer. The broader development of both services has been dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence which sets out the principal elements of a plan to implement the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by Price Waterhouse, as follows: a new organisational structure based on operations and support divisions with an overall manpower level of around 1,144; a planned approach to sea-shore rotation of personnel based on a two-year period of commitment to sea-going duties followed by a two-year period away from such duties; service level agreements with principal clients such as the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; regular recruitment and other measures such as schemes for the commissioning of enlisted personnel to address personnel shortfalls; enhancement of the naval college and development of proposals for a joint initiative with Cork Institute of Technology, in order to meet changing needs and keep pace with the increased demand for maritime education and training responses; and continuation of a programme of investment at the naval base to improve the buildings and other infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The recommendation for the relocation of Naval Service headquarters in Haulbowline was implemented in December 1999. Last week I signed an order for a new, state of the art vessel similar to the <i>L.E. Róisín</i>.</P>

      <P>Bovine animals which react positively to either a TB or brucellosis test must, by law, be removed to an approved export premises for slaughter. Animals which react to these tests demonstrate an immune response to an antigen, which indicates that they have been exposed to a given pathogen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> The EU directive, which legislates for intra-community trade in fresh meat, requires that all such animals are given a detailed veterinary examination and in this regard my Department maintains a permanent veterinary presence at all export slaughter premises. Each test reactor receives a full veterinary post mortem, the results of which determine eligibility for entry into the food chain.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has recently reviewed the arrangements in place and is satisfied that there are no public health implications involved.</P>

      <P>Under the current bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes compensation arrangements, a herdowner can receive compensation under a range of measures, namely, reactor grants, income supplement, depopulation grants and hardship grants, provided the herdowner meets the specified requirements for each compensatory measure. I will arrange to forward a copy of these requirements and compensation rates to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the compensation payable by my Department a herdowner is also paid salvage value by the factory which slaughters the animal, the amount of which is a matter between the factory and the herdowner.</P>

      <P>The person named commenced in the REP scheme on 1 November 1995. His second year application was due for submission not later than 31 January 1997 but was never made. Consequently his participation in the scheme was terminated. My Department wrote to him on 10 March 1998, seeking reimbursement of his first year REPS payment. A reminder issued on 30 September 1998, informing him that if he did not refund the amount owed within two weeks arrangements would be made to offset the amount against other moneys payable to him from my Department. The person named did not at any stage propose to make repayment and consequently payments due under the following schemes, that is, special beef, extensification and cattle headage, must be withheld until the debt is cleared.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): As I outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 154 on 5 April, the European Commission is at present finalising the guidelines which will govern the Leader+ initiative and the outcome is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>Pending the publication of the definitive guidelines document and the acceptance by the European Commission of the detailed proposals which I will be putting forward in relation to both Leader+ and the national Leader measure, it is not possible to indicate the rates of grant which will apply to categories of projects and activities.</P>
    <P>Under the EU Agenda 2000 agreement, rural development strategy is given the status of &ldquo;Second Pillar&rdquo;, in recognition that the future of agriculture and rural localities is dependent on much more than farming. In that context, I refer to the White Paper on Rural Development published in August last which outlines in a comprehensive way the Government's strategy for the future of rural areas. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides the monetary resource to deliver on that strategy. The substantial £6.7 billion allocated in the plan under the broad heading of rural development underscores the emphasis on developing rural areas to full potential and demonstrates the commitment to achieving a balanced development across the country.</P>

Veterinary officials of my Department have inspected the premises on a number of occasions over recent months and the owner has been made aware of the conditions and the outstanding related modifications for licensing under these regulations. A further inspection of the premises will be arranged shortly. Failure to meet the requisite standards will result in proceedings to close the premises.</P>
    <P>Recent inspections by Department officials have not indicated any major disease risks from these premises and the purpose of these centres is to improve the collection system for offal and specified risk material to protect public and animal health from potential risk. The issue of planning permission is not one for my Department and is a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>When the disadvantaged areas appeals panel were commencing their examination of areas, including County Monaghan, for reclassification in 1992 it was decided, following a meeting with farming organisations, that the panel would base their recommendations on data gathered in the 1989 survey.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that if the income limit was raised from 40% to 60% and the working population limit was disregarded, then the data would allow selection of a significant number of additional areas. A further condition was that the land must be rated at four or lower on a quality scale of zero to nine, and also that selected areas must adjoin existing more severely handicapped areas.</P>
      <P>Using these criteria, the appeals panel selected an additional 30% of Monaghan for reclassification as more severely handicapped, and this was approved by the EU Commission in November 1995, bringing the area of land designated more severely handicapped in Monaghan to 73% of total land in the county.</P>
      <P>Following representations regarding areas not included, it was decided to carry out a complete re-check of the less severely handicapped areas in Monaghan, including those reclassified in 1995. This re-check highlighted a number of areas which the appeals panel had inadvertently omitted from their original recommendation. A supplementary proposal to the EU Commission was prepared and submitted in April 1997 to include these additional areas. This was finally approved by the STAR Committee in February 1999, bringing the area of land designated more severely handicapped in Monaghan to 85% .</P>
      <P>Following a review in 1999 of the remaining less severely handicapped area in Monaghan, four further townlands were identified as satisfying the criteria. A proposal to have these reclassified as more severely handicapped is in preparation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, based on the data available, all areas of County Monaghan which could be shown to satisfy the criteria for more severely handicapped status have now been or are in the process of being reclassified.</P>

      <P>Work is continuing on the preparation of detailed commonage framework plans which will set maximum stocking levels for commonages. When these plans are put into effect, farmers to whom maximum stocking levels apply will be required, if they wish to qualify for headage or premia payments, to take part either in an EU-funded agri-environmental scheme operated by the Department or in a nationally funded scheme to be introduced by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Proposals for a new agri-environmental scheme to replace the current rural environmental protection scheme were submitted to the Commission by my Department as part of a draft rural development plan 2000-2006 and discussions on the plan are taking place between my Department and the Commission. I understand that proposals for a national scheme have been submitted to the Commission by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and are being considered at present. Participation in these schemes will require implementation of the stocking levels in the commonage framework plans. Pending the completion of the detailed plans, the interim commonage framework plans, which provide for a 30% reduction in 1998 sheep numbers in the six western counties where overgrazing had been identified, will continue in effect.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Kildare County Council agreed that a Garda station could be provided on the council's site at Confey, Leixlip, as part of a proposed development that would also contain a library and a community centre. The plots that the council has assigned to the Garda station and community centre each contain part of Newtown House. This building would have to be demolished if these elements of the development are to be erected on the areas assigned. The council granted planning permission for the new community centre project, including the demolition of Newtown House.  However, this is now the subject of an appeal to An Bórd Pleanála. The feasibility of providing a Garda station on the Confey site will depend upon the outcome of this appeal.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have recently been offered another site in Leixlip. The suitability of this site for a Garda station is currently being examined.</P>

      <P>In order to promote lifetime transfers of land and encourage more young people to pursue farming, section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994, provided for a two-thirds relief from stamp duty on the transfer of land to a young trained farmer. This relief was introduced for a three year period and was extended for a further three years until 31 December 1999 in the Finance Act, 1997. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the two-thirds relief is increased to a full relief in the Finance Act, 2000, for three years until 31 December 2002.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the relief a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is one who: is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; and is the holder of one of the specified qualifications, for example, the Teagasc certificate in farming; or if born before 1 January 1968, has three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours duration.</P>
      <P>Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he/she may obtain the relief by way of a refund provided that the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.</P>

      <P>The position is that the VAT treatment of sporting organisations is a direct consequence of EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary and sporting activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by registered businesses.</P>

      <P>The stamp duty yield for the first quarter of 2000 was £197 million. Some £56.7 million of this yield relates to stamp duty on housing.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty rates for all residential property were reduced significantly in the Finance (No 2) Act, 1998. This reduction formed part of a package of measures introduced in response to the first Bacon report on housing and were aimed at addressing the rapid increase in house prices in recent years. These measures also included a withdrawal of the stamp duty exemption on new houses for non-owner occupiers which was designed to reduce the number of investors in the market and free up the supply side.</P>
      <P>There is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner-occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house is more than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged only on the site cost or a quarter of the value of the house, whichever is the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, the Government commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to review the effectiveness of the measures taken in 1998 and to consider other recent developments in the housing sector. In their second report, the consultants noted that there is widespread consensus that the Government actions have played a key role in achieving a slow down in the rate of increase in house prices. In addition to the taxation measures introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, and the Finance Act, 1999, on foot of the recommendations of the two Bacon reports, there are also a number of measures which my colleagues, the <Col N="1433" /> Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal have announced in this regard. These measures, which have been discussed at length both inside and outside this House, are aimed at increasing the supply of housing as well as improving the affordability of house purchasing.</P>
    <P>The latest figures received from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the final quarter of 1999 indicate average annual house price increases of approximately 16% for new houses and 18% for second-hand houses on a national basis &ndash; well below the peak rates of increase, 26% and 37%, recorded in mid-1998. Annual rates of increase in Dublin for new and second-hand house prices, around 22%, are also well below the peaks of 37% and 42% reached in 1998. Moreover, indications of price trends in the early part of the year are also positive, with the Irish Permanent house price index and the Department of the Environment and Local Government's provisional monthly prices both showing further slowdowns.</P>
    <P>Given the significant stamp duty reductions in 1998 and the moderation of house price increases over the last two years, I have no plans, at present, to reduce further the rates of stamp duty on residential property.</P>

      <Quest>if the £50 million donation committed to the proposed national stadium qualifies as a gift of property to the nation under the State Property Act, 1998; and the extra benefits which can be claimed by the donor in relation to residency as a result of the gift.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10726/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 30 March 2000, section 19 of the State Property Act, 1954, deals with gifts of property made to the State, the nation or the people. It is for the Government to decide whether to accept or refuse any gift made under the Act. I also outlined that the offer to contribute £50 million towards the financing and development of Campus and Stadium Ireland had been accepted by the Government as a gift under the State Property Act, 1954, and vested in An Taoiseach, as the appropriate State authority.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that any extra benefits in relation to tax residency can be claimed automatically as a result of the gift. The State Property Act, 1954, contains no taxation provisions apart from a stamp duty exemption on any transfer of property to the State under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a special tax relief available in regard to gifts to the State by non-residents under section 825 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This provision was introduced in the 1977 Finance Act to deal with a particular case involving a gift to the State of a heritage type property. Section 825 provides that where a person makes a gift of property to the State, and it is accepted <Col N="1434" /> as a gift under the State Property Act, 1954, any visits by that person, or their spouse when accompanying that person, shall be disregarded in determining whether that person or their spouse is resident or ordinarily resident in the State for the purposes of Irish tax. Visits in this case are defined in the section as visits by the donor for the purpose of advising on the management of the property which is the subject of the gift, being visits that are in the aggregate less than 182 days in any year of assessment in which they are made.</P>
    <P>It is by no means clear that this section can be interpreted as applying to a financial contribution. The question of whether a particular donation to the State qualifies for this latter relief, which is long standing and of general application, is a matter to be determined on the facts of each individual case. The Government has no role in that determination.</P>

    <P>VAT returns set out the total of VAT charged, on sales, less VAT reclaimed, on business purchases, in a particular return period. Thus, the VAT returns do not identify the yield from particular trade sectors. In the circumstances, the amount of VAT collected in respect of agricultural purchases, as returned by traders registered for VAT, cannot be identified in the overall yield of VAT. Most farmers are not registered for VAT and are not required to make VAT returns themselves. Rather they are compensated for the VAT incurred on their purchases through the mechanism of the flat rate scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water sup<Col N="1440" /> plies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the faculty of public health medi<Col N="1441" /> cine of The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960. A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the eight regional health boards, have awarded a contract jointly to Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Cork, to advise health boards on an up-to-date status report on all aspects relating to fluoride use including water fluoridation. When advice and recommendations are available from these bodies appropriate consultation will take place to inform future policy on fluoride use for this country.</P>
      <P>In relation to hip fractures, a series of ecological studies have demonstrated either no relationship, reduced risk or increased risk. Ecological studies are not useful for demonstrating cause and effect but are useful for generating hypotheses. Medical researchers in Sheffield found no link between fluoride in drinking water and hip fracture when using a population based case control study. This is the most reliable method for demonstrating probable cause and effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health annd Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 281 together.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the inquiry into all issues relating to post-mortem examinations, organ removal, organ retention and organ disposal, which I announced on Wednesday, 9 February 2000.</P>
      <P>Last week I outlined the details of the format of the inquiry which will essentially be conducted in two phases. The first phase of the inquiry will be headed up by Ms Anne Dunne, who is an eminent senior counsel.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the inquiry provides that the inquiry will make its final report within six months. On receipt of this report I will then table a motion that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee has powers of compellability and discoverability available to it under the Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas (compellability, privileges and immunities of witnesses) Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>I considered a full range of options with regard to the format of the inquiry and decided that the non statutory inquiry, as outlined above, is the most appropriate. The advantages of a non statutory inquiry include: the needs and concerns of the parents representative group Parents for Justice can be met by this route, speed of establishment, flexibility in its approach and less rigid in its implementation; relatively informal and less adversarial, and it can deal with the painful issues involved over a shorter period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In announcing the inquiry I clearly stated its purpose will be to establish the full facts in regard <Col N="1443" /> to past practice relating to post-mortem examinations and I am confident that the format proposed will succeed in this.</P>
    <P>I am very aware that considerable trauma and sorrow has been revisited on parents and next of kin by the disclosures in recent months relating to post-mortem examinations. I fully recognise that all affected are anxious that a professional inquiry be conducted which will allow for the full facts to emerge. I am confident that the inquiry as outlined will provide a new context in which all relevant issues can be dealt with and that the inquiry will assist everybody concerned in moving forward in a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect between patients and service providers to the benefit of all those who rely on our health services.</P>
    <P>Having considered all the options, including establishing a tribunal of inquiry, I am of the opinion that the best way forward lies in the proposed non statutory route supported by allowing for referral to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>

      <P>Casemix is an internationally accepted management system for the monitoring and evaluation of health services and, was introduced by my department in 1993, after several years preparation, to allow for the collection, categorisation and interpretation of hospital patient data related to the types of cases treated, in the hope that it would assist hospitals to define their products, measure their productivity, and assess quality.</P>
      <P>The key benefit of casemix measurement is the extent to which it provides a common language for service planning, management and development, that is meaningful to both clinicians and managers, and facilitates cost comparison, clinical audit, strategic services needs identification and planning, and the collection of meaningful epidemiological data. As such, I fully support its implementation, expansion and development, and am committed to increasing the number and type of hospitals involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The hospitals which currently participate in the national casemix programme are set out in the following table. Hospitals participate in the programme when their information and costing systems are considered adequate to meaningfully reflect their activity and costs. Work is ongoing between my Department and a range of hospitals, which do not currently participate in casemix, in order to establish an appropriate time frame for their participation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he has initiated any studies into the incidence of bacterial meningitis which has increased almost five-fold since 1990 with over 600 cases reported in 1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10435/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>Eighteen deaths from bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, were notified to my Department by the health boards in 1999. In 2000, 12 such deaths have been reported to date.</P>
      <P>The number of cases of bacterial meningitis notified to my Department in 1990 was 131. The provisional number of cases notified in 1999 is 614. The increased level of notifications of bacterial meningitis and related conditions in recent years is in part attributable to the greatly increased awareness among health professionals and the general public, as well as improved techniques for diagnosis of the condition. Nonetheless, while there continues to be much research in relation to meningitis, it is not fully understood why Ireland experiences such a different pattern of disease to other countries in Europe and elsewhere. It should be noted that, despite the increased incidence of meningitis, there has not been a corresponding increase in mortality from this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Working Group on Bacterial Meningitis, which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer and which published reports in 1997 <Col N="1446" /> and 1999, includes among its members a range of medical experts who are closely involved in dealing with meningococcal disease in Ireland. The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research, at national and international level, so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
    <P>A new conjugate vaccine to protect against group C meningococcal disease, which represents about 40% of the disease in Ireland, is expected to become available later this year and planning is under way for its introduction into the primary childhood immunisation programme and for it to be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme. It will also be important that, even after the group C vaccine is introduced, vigilance is maintained, as there will still be a significant risk of people contracting group B disease, which represents about 60% of the cases occurring in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>In recent years surveillance systems in relation to meningitis have been significantly improved. Health boards are required to notify details of cases to my Department within 24 hours of them occurring and these arrangements are operating effectively. My Department has also funded the establishment of the meningococcal reference laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and the diagnostic service provided by this laboratory has had a significant impact on case ascertainment and confirmation of the diagnosis of invasive meningococcal disease. As part of the preparations for the introduction of the new vaccine the meningococcal reference laboratory is undertaking a study to establish the sub-strains of group C meningococcal disease currently circulating in Ireland. This will enable an analysis to be carried out after the vaccine has been introduced, to establish its effect on the sub-strains of the disease in circulation.</P>
    <P>The development of the national disease surveillance centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database, which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in recent years a considerable amount of research has been undertaken in Ireland on a range of issues in relation to this disease, including whether particular sub-groups within the population may be at particular risk of contracting meningococcal infection, the question of genetic susceptibility to infection, the early management of the acute condition and on the follow up of surviving children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific study has been carried out in this country on the impact the new meningococcal C vaccine will have on the number of cases of the disease in Ireland. The provisional number of cases of bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, notified to my Department by the health boards in 1999 was 614. This figure is currently the subject of a validation exercise. It is estimated that, nationally, approximately one-third of cases involve group C disease.</P>
      <P>The vaccine can be introduced in this country only when the statutory licensing authority, the Irish Medicines Board, has granted the necessary authorisation. The Irish Medicines Board must of course satisfy itself that the product meets the requirements in relation to such issues as safety and efficacy, before a product authorisation is granted. The latest indications are that the vaccine should be licensed and available for use here in the summer.</P>
      <P>Preliminary reports from the United Kingdom, where the vaccine has already been licensed and introduced, indicate that the vaccine has been effective in significantly reducing the incidence of group C meningococcal disease in the age-groups targeted there to date.</P>
      <P>Planning is under way for the introduction of the new vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation programme and for it to be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme beginning later this year. As part of the preparations for the introduction of the new vaccine, the meningococcal reference laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, is undertaking a study to establish the sub-strains of group C meningococcal disease currently circulating in Ireland. This will enable an analysis to be carried out after the vaccine has been introduced, to establish its effect on the sub-strains of the disease in circulation.</P>

There is no indication that any urgent amendment of the Act, including an extension of the period of temporary registration of non-EU doctors, is necessary.

      <P>The Government is committed to the development of services to children with autism. In recent years significant additional funding has been allocated for the development of these services. £4.6 million has been provided since 1998, with a full year cost of £5.1 million in 2001, specifically for the development of health related support services for children with autism.</P>
      <P>The health related support services required are essentially assessment, early intervention, respite and outreach support services to the children, teachers and families, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, psychological and psychiatric intervention, nursing, social work and home support. The provision of residential services, where appropriate, would also be part of these support services.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science, which has responsibility for the provision of educational services, has established a number of special classes for children with autism and the health boards have established multi-disciplinary teams to provide these classes with the support services outlined above. These teams work closely with parents and teachers in order to address the needs of the children concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to a significant programme of capital and revenue investment over the period 2000 to 2002 to meet the identified needs of persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. My Department will continue to work with the health boards, voluntary agencies, the Department of Education and Science and the families of children with autism to meet both their current and long-term health related needs.</P>

My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
      <P>To date this Government has provided just over £67 million for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments.

This funding will be primarily targeted at the provision of additional day care places and home support services. To this end, I have targeted £3 million, rising to £6 million in the year 2001, for home support services, which include personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>The further issues raised by the Deputy relate to accessibility to public housing and to public places which are matters for the Department of the Environment and Local Government, accessible public transport which is a matter for the Department of Public Enterprise and the funding of &ldquo;Vantastic&rdquo; and anti-discrimination laws, both of which are matters for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I met with the president, the registrar and a number of members of the Medical Council on Tuesday 28 March. Among other issues, I discussed the need to bring in a new Medical Practitioners Act. I have asked the council to present its own proposals for reform in this area. I hope to be in a position to produce the heads of a Bill by the middle of the year. At the meeting with the council it was agreed that a liaison arrangement would be established with the council to deal with reform of the Act and other issues. The <Col N="1453" /> first meeting with the council under the arrangement took place on Monday, 10 April.  Any amendment to the existing Act will examine the composition of the council to ensure that it equitably balances the interests of the general public and the profession.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council and the broader profession are conscious of the privilege which the principle of self-regulation represents. It is also aware that the public needs to be assured that self-regulation is effective in protecting the public. I am confident that self-regulation will remain the underlying principle in any new legislation.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Medical Practitioners Act is a matter for the council both in terms of the behaviour of doctors in the register as well as dealing with persons claiming to be medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>I have not been presented with any evidence which suggests that the Medical Council deals with applications for registration other than in a fair and equitable fashion.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organisation has recommended that each country should prepare a plan to deal with the issues which would arise in the event of a future influenza pandemic. A pandemic would involve the emergence of a new virus strain to which a high proportion of the population would have no immunity.

      <P>I am in the process of establishing a national influenza pandemic committee, whose tasks will be to prepare a detailed plan for a prompt and effective national response to an influenza pandemic, taking into account WHO guidelines in this area. I am also asking the committee to draw up a plan to address the more regular outbreaks of influenza and influenza-like illnesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns relating to antibiotic resistant organisms. Much international research has been carried out in this area and, at a European level, Ireland is involved in surveillance of antibiotic-resistant organisms.</P>
      <P>On the initiative of EU chief medical officers, a major international conference on this subject was held in Copenhagen in September 1998. My Department was represented by the deputy chief medical officer and service providers were represented by a range of health care professionals. Arising from recommendations made at the conference, my Department entered into discussions with appropriate agencies, including the national disease surveillance centre, with a view to disseminating relevant information through the Irish health services and monitoring any further developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important form of antibiotic resistant bacteria encountered in Ireland is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus &ndash; MRSA. MRSA is not a statutorily notifiable infectious disease and so statistics on its occurrence are not routinely compiled by my Department. In 1995 a survey was carried out to ascertain the number of times MRSA was isolated in acute hospitals in each health board area over a defined time period. The objective of this survey was to obtain an indication of the MRSA problem in Ireland prior to introducing national MRSA guidelines. A survey of all microbiology laboratories in Ireland was carried out over two weeks in spring 1995. MRSA was isolated from 448 patients during the two week period. The prevalence of MRSA during this period was 16.5 in every 1,000 discharges. A repeat all-Ireland study was undertaken in 1999 under the direction of the Department of Public <Col N="1456" /> Health in the Eastern Health Board. The results of this study are expected to be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The importance of infection control has been recognised for some time and was specifically addressed by my Department in 1995. At that time, detailed guidelines in relation to the control of MRSA were developed and circulated by my Department. While the guidelines dealt specifically with the control of MRSA, the principles set out in the guidelines are equally applicable to control of hospital-acquired infection in general. The guidelines draw attention to such issues as the need for education and training of staff and for infection control structures and procedures. In particular, the guidelines emphasise that hand-washing is the most important factor in preventing the spread of MRSA, stressing that consultants and nurse managers must insist on good hand-washing procedures. I fully endorse the approach set out in these guidelines which emphasise the importance of implementing appropriate infection control procedures and practices in line with the guidelines with a view to ensuring that hospital acquired infection is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In addition to the guidelines already published, my Department also intends to establish multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral policies to reduce the threat that anti-microbial resistance poses and has requested the National Disease Surveillance Centre to convene an expert group to advise on this matter. Among the range of issues on which the NDSC has been asked to consider is the development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community settings. The NDSC is currently preparing a report on these issues and the problem of anti-microbial resistance generally.</P>

      <P>In December 1999 the Government agreed in principle to introduce changes in the manner in which the health service insures itself and its employees against claims for clinical negligence. The Government has also asked that consideration be given to the introduction of a no fault scheme for brain-damaged infants. My predecessor and the Attorney General met representatives of the Medical Defence Union and the medical protection society at the end of last year to discuss changes in the way in which personal injury claims are dealt with by the courts. The two organisations have since made written submissions to the Attorney General on reform in this area.</P>

      <P>My Department has not received any direct communication from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in relation to recognition of units for training purposes.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na n-Ospidéal is the statutory body responsible for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs and such other officers or staffs may be prescribed in hospitals engaged in the provision of services.</P>
      <P>I understand the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has been in discussion with comhairle on the implications of the approach proposed by the institute in relation to arrangements for the recognition of obstetric units for training purposes. I have been advised that comhairle has raised a number of issues with the institute and on receipt of its response comhairle will consider the proposal further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of infection control has been recognised for some time and was specifically addressed by my Department in 1995. At that time, detailed guidelines in relation to the control of MRSA &ndash; Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus &ndash; were developed and circulated by my Department. While the guidelines dealt specifically with the control of MRSA, the principles set out in the guidelines are equally applicable to control of hospital-acquired infection in general. The guidelines draw attention to such issues as the need for education and training of staff and for infection control structures and procedures. In particular, the guidelines emphasise that hand washing is the most important factor in preventing the spread of hospital acquired infection in general, stressing that consultants and nurse managers must insist on good hand wash<Col N="1462" /> ing procedures. I fully endorse the approach set out in these guidelines which emphasise the importance of implementing appropriate infection control procedures and practices in line with the guidelines with a view to enduring that hospital acquired infection is kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In addition to the guidelines already published, my Department also intends to establish multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral policies to reduce the threat that anti-microbial resistance poses and has requested the National Disease Surveillance Centre to undertake work in this area. Among the range of issues on which the NDSC has been asked to advise is the development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community settings. The NDSC is currently preparing a report on these issues.</P>

It is intended that the deliberations of the medical manpower forum will be arrived at unanimously. Accordingly, some further work is required, including discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, in order to achieve a consensus.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 268 together.</P>
      <P>The limited change in animal quarantine procedures, recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, is not considered to constitute a significant additional risk to public health. Nonetheless, on 10 March, my Department's chief medical officer wrote to the director of public health in each health board, informing them of the change in quarantine procedures and requesting them to ensure that they have appropriate procedures in place in case of a suspected occurrence of the disease. The health boards are statutorily responsible for the control and prevention of infectious diseases in their areas of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stocks of human diploid cell rabies vaccine for national use are held at the National Fever Hospital, Cherry Orchard, Dublin and can be made available at short notice for use in cases where there is a risk that a person may have been <Col N="1466" /> exposed to rabies. In addition, my Department has recently asked the Southern Health Board to consider holding a small stock of the vaccine to facilitate more immediate access in the event of it being required in that board's own area or in the adjacent regions.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir &ndash; the Registrar-General of births, deaths and marriages &ndash; and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide that An tArd-Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, steps are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency. flexibility, access and <Col N="1467" /> management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. The anticipated date of completion of this project is mid-2002. This project will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the General Register Office.</P>
    <P>In the interim other measures taken to improve services in the General Register Office include the relocation of the public counter on the first floor in Joyce House in July 1999 to provide additional space in the public reading room. Work is about to commence on additional improvements to the reading room in the General Register Office. Other issues raised in the council's report are being considered in the context of the review of the service to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>

      <P>I am fully committed to building on recent investment in Mallow General Hospital to allow the hospital to continue to provide a high quality level of care to its patients, in line with the priorities identified by the Southern Health Board. The recent provision of funding to open thirteen additional medical beds at the hospital represents a major investment in the future of Mallow General Hospital and clearly emphasises the Government's commitment to the hospital.</P>

      <P>The work which is being carried out at the General Register Office in Roscommon involves the computerisation of all the historical records of the office dating back to 1845. The cost of the work undertaken to date amounts to £3.355 million. The original estimated cost was £3 million including the costs of the community employment scheme workers and the estimated cost at completion is £6.225 million. The original estimate of costs was based on a project providing training and employment through the community employment scheme and taking at least three years to complete. However, having regard to the scale and complexity of the project and the capacity of modern information technology to deal with old documents, a number of unanticipated issues arose and had to be resolved. Accordingly, initial progress was slower than estimated. The above mentioned community employment scheme ended in August 1999 and replacement staff are in the process of being recruited. It is now expected that the project will be completed in 2002.</P>

      <P>At the end of January 2000 there were approximately 3,550 persons residing in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation in the Eastern Regional Authority area &ndash; formerly the Eastern Health Board area &ndash; of whom 2,600 were asylum seekers and 950 were indigenous homeless persons. For the same period for the years 1998 and 1999 there were approximately 1,650 and 1,630 asylum seekers respectively in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation. The figures for indigenous homeless persons for the years 1998 and 1999 are not available.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are mental handicap, mental illness &ndash; for persons under 16 years <Col N="1472" /> only &ndash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

    <P>The EU is addressing the problem of coronary heart disease through a number of initiatives. For example, the EU health promotion, information, education and training programme supports projects that focus on lifestyle factors to promote heart health such as the promotion of health enhancing physical activity <i>via </i>a European network and training in the area of nutrition to promote healthy eating habits.</P>
    <P>One such project, the European Heart Health Initiative &ndash; EHHI &ndash; aims to strengthen co-operation and to promote effective action in order to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The EHHI promotes awareness raising amongst policy makers and health professionals of the <Col N="1475" /> importance of addressing cardiovascular disease and how efficiently this can be achieved. A second phase of EHHI has been proposed to the community action programme to build on the aims of phase one. This proposal is currently in suspension for the consideration of funding allocation.</P>
    <P>Tobacco smoking is a major factor in heart disease. A proposal for a directive amending the existing EU directives on labelling and tar content is currently being debated by the Council and Parliament. I hope that it will be operational within a year. This measure will augment the existing EU directive relating to advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products which was adopted in 1998.</P>
    <P>In July 1999, the Taoiseach launched the cardiovascular health strategy group report, &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo; which highlights that Ireland's premature death rates from coronary heart disease for men and women is twice the EU average. My Department has set, as a medium term objective, to reduce levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease to the EU average, at a minimum, and a long-term objective to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
    <P>The report contains 211 recommendations designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner over a five year period. This year £12 million has been made available to fund the implementation of &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo; and in particular, to progress areas of health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital care and in the area of audit and evaluation.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands.  The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the programme for prosperity and fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986, enables charges to be <Col N="1479" /> made by health boards for in-patient and out-patient services for persons who received or are entitled to receive damages or compensation in respect of treatment for injuries caused by road traffic accidents.</P>
      <P>The charges levied are normally the cost of providing the services or the average daily cost to the hospital concerned. The manner in which charges are raised under the Act is being appealed to the Supreme Court and the case is expected to be heard towards the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and I have asked the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board to write to the Deputy directly <Col N="1480" /> explaining the circumstances in which charges were made in this case.</P>

      <P>I have no information on any proposed pilot recycling scheme in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emerging local and regional waste management plans provide for improved waste services and the development of an integrated waste management infrastructure which will facilitate the achievement of ambitious waste recovery and recycling targets. Typically, these plans provide for the segregation at source and separate collection of dry recyclable and organic materials in <Col N="1483" /> urban areas; extended networks of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities for recyclable materials in rural areas; the development of an integrated range of waste infrastructure, including civic amenity sites, transfer stations, materials recovery facilities and centralised biological and thermal treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that these plans be adopted and implemented by local authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government will directly support the delivery of improved waste management services and infrastructure. Some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in the 1998 policy statement &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo; with the publication this year of another policy statement focusing on waste minimisation, recycling and recovery generally. This will outline the scope of measures to be undertaken in the interests of a sustained improvement in our recycling performance.</P>

The process involves the registration authority carrying out house-to-<Col N="1486" /> house or other local inquiries during September-October and in many cases delivering registration &ndash; RFA &ndash; forms to households for completion.</P>
      <P>The draft register is published on 1 November and is made available for examination at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. The public are invited to check the draft during this period to make sure that they are correctly registered. Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February.</P>
      <P>I am keen to ensure that the register of electors used at any poll should be as accurate as possible. The law in relation to registration procedures is under regular review in my Department and there have been a number of changes in recent years which have helped to improve accuracy. The changes include the provision for entry of persons who are omitted from the original register on to a supplement to the register during the currency of that register. New categories of electors are also entitled to apply for entry in the postal voters list. In addition, the law also allows certain electors to apply for entry on a supplement to the postal voters and special voters lists during the lifetime of a register.</P>
      <P>Further improvements to the registration process are also among a number of electoral matters that I am currently examining.</P>

      <P>There is currently one directive relating to my Department which remains to be transposed into Irish law. This is Council Directive 98/49/EC on the safeguarding of the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the European Community, which was adopted on 29 June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive primarily deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another. It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are <Col N="1489" /> posted. Member states are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative arrangements necessary to comply with the directive not later than 25 July 2001.</P>
    <P>In order to comply with the terms of the directive, an amendment to the Pensions Act is necessary. This amendment will be incorporated into the new pensions Bill, which I expect to publish by July next.</P>

      <Quest>the number of schemes and the level of payments available to asylum seekers under the supplementary welfare allowance and exceptional needs schemes; the main type and cost of exceptional needs payments made to asylum seekers in each of the years 1997 to 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance system on behalf of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. Payments to asylum seekers are made on the same basis as payments to other recipients.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation. Where a person in full board accommodation receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to £72.00 per week for a single adult, £115.20 per week for a couple and £13.20 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to £64 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to £155 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers may also make an application for a one parent family payment and old age non-contributory pension if they satisfy the necessary conditions. An interim SWA payment can be made while they are awaiting a decision on their claim. In addition, asylum seekers are paid child benefit in respect of child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation governing the supplementary <Col N="1490" /> welfare allowance scheme makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. ENPs paid to asylum seekers would normally be for clothing, prams, buggies and rent deposits. The ENP payments to asylum seekers are not identified separately from other categories of recipients.</P>
    <P>Details of expenditure on ENPs in 1998 and 1999 are contained in the following tabular statements. Computerisation of the SWA scheme commenced in 1996 and was completed in six of the eight health boards in December 1997. Comprehensive statistics on ENPs are, therefore, not available for 1997. The total expenditure on ENPs in 1997 was £21.6 million.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>Payments are made where a person has no means to meet their immediate needs pending payment from another source, for example, where they are awaiting determination of an application for a social welfare or a health board payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people who need full time care and attention. At the end of March 2000, there were 14,981 carer's allowances in payment. This represents an increase of more than 60% in the number of carers claiming the allowance since this Government took office. Expenditure on carer's allowance was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115% since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was launched by me in October 1998. The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. In addition, both I and my officials have met with various organisations representing carers on a number of occasions and I am aware of their views, concerns and priorities in relation to carers. The major issues raised by these groups are the removal or easing of the carer's allowance means test and recognition of carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his/her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of the income from employment and other sources. In line with budget 1999 changes which came into effect last August, the first £150 of joint weekly income for married carers is not taken into account in the means test. In the case of single carers, the first £75 of weekly income is disregarded. I should add that the <Col N="1493" /> means disregard for carer's allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. The review also noted that the means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income. It considered that the means test should be maintained as a way of targeting public resources towards those who are most in need. The position and operation of the test will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>While the review did not recommend the abolition of the means test, it did propose the introduction of a continual care payment in certain circumstances in recognition of those carers who are providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. The review envisaged that the payment would be available to carers who provide care to those who are in the highest category of dependency and would be paid irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement.</P>
    <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>A working group, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, and comprising membership from my Department, the health boards and voluntary groups has been set up to examine the feasibility of introducing such a needs assessment approach. I understand that the Western Health Board has agreed to undertake a pilot project in that area and that needs assessments will be commencing in the near future. The introduction of a continual care payment will be examined further following the outcome of this pilot.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 317 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to lone-parents and long-term unemployed persons to return to the active labour force. The scheme has a limited number of places and it is targeted at people who need the additional income support which the scheme provides in order to return to employment. The rules of the scheme therefore require that an application must be made prior to taking up employment. Claims made subsequently indicate that the person was in a position to take up employment without the need for the financial support which the scheme provides.</P>
    <P>No application for the allowance has been received from the person concerned. She inquired about the back to work allowance in June 1999 when her entitlement to a one parent family payment ceased. She is now being advised to formally apply for the back to work allowance and an application form is being sent to her.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether she qualifies for the allowance will depend on the circumstances of the case and I will advise both Deputies of the outcome of the application in due course.</P>

      <P>Following the death of the person concerned the schedule of assets indicated that he had capital which he had not disclosed to the Department in connection with his claim for old age non-contributory pension. His means were therefore revised, giving rise to an apparent overpayment of some £9,000. On further examination, however, it emerged that he was entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> pension based on his British and Irish insurance records. This reduced the overpayment to £5,378.50. The case has been considered under the Department's code of practice for the recovery of overpayments and a settlement of £4,000 has been agreed.</P>

      <P>In May 1997 tenders were sought for consultancy assistance in the preparation of the Pensions Board report on the national pensions policy initiative. The objective of this initiative was to facilitate a national debate on developing a pensions system which would enable all residents in the State to maintain their established standard of living on retirement.</P>
      <P>Following a competitive tender process the contract for this consultancy was awarded to the company concerned. Payments from this Department totalling £117,687, including VAT, were made between July 1997 and the completion of the consultancy in 1998.</P>

      <P>The improvements in the back to work scheme which I announced in January are for the benefit of people out of work for more than five years. The enhancements being made are designed to encourage this cohort of unemployed people to return to work by providing them with training and additional cash bonuses. The improvements are intended specifically to help people who find it difficult to obtain employment with an employer and are a direct response to what we are hearing from long-term unemployed people who are encouraged by present economic circumstances to believe that they can find work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension is not designed for people becoming self-employed. A wide range of sup<Col N="1496" /> ports already exist for persons becoming self-employed under the back to work enterprise allowance programme. These include, four years of financial support including a first year at 100% of their former unemployment payment rate as compared with three years for employees; financial assistance in the setting up of the business towards e.g. the cost of training, advertising, preparation of business plans etc. and a contribution towards the cost of capital items; a special interest free start up loan from the Department's joint enterprise loan fund with First Step Limited and credit union loans guaranteed by the Department's credit union loan guarantee fund.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department's jobs facilitators will advise on other options which may be available from other sources for those involved. In these circumstances the application of the new arrangements to the self-employed category would not be warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The new conditions for the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements has been designed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000 to ease the transition from welfare into work. Following those consultations the substantial changes to the conditions for the retention of rent/mortgage interest supplement by participants on active labour market programmes were announced in budget 2000 and came into effect on 6 April 2000. These changes include generous disregards in the assessment of means and a tapered withdrawal of the supplement. I have no plans to reconsider the changes at this time.</P>
      <P>While the £250 gross household weekly income limit will still apply, any back to work allowance and family income supplement in payment will be disregarded in the assessment of this income. Furthermore, the £250 monthly rent and mortgage supplement limit will be abolished. Instead, withdrawal of the supplement will be tapered out over four years. Some 75% of the previous rate entitlement will be paid in year one, 50 % in year two, 25% in year three, and 25% in year four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures have been designed to assist and encourage people some of whom are long-term unemployed to make the transition from welfare into work. Previously a person would receive support at a constant level for the duration of the scheme and then be faced with a sharp drop when moving into full-time employment. Under the new tapering system the withdrawal of the supplement is gradual over the dur<Col N="1497" /> ation of the scheme making the transition into full-time employment easier.</P>
    <P>The new measures are also particularly beneficial to families. Previously rent and mortgage interest supplements were capped at £250 per month. A family with a high monthly rent of £650 would under the old rules only retain £250 of their £642.50 monthly rent supplement. This was a drop of £392. Under the new rules they will retain £482 in year one, £321 in year two and £160 in years three and four.</P>
    <P>These new measures are also more equitable as all participants are treated in a similar manner. Under the old rules families and single people were capped at the same level which did not take account of the difference in the rent they were paying.</P>
    <P>People who started back to work or community employment schemes prior to 6 April 2000 can choose to be assessed under either the old or the new rules, whichever is most beneficial to that individual. However, after 6 April 2000 people who take up a CE or BTW scheme will be assessed under the new rules.</P>

      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. The 2000 scheme of grants was advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers on 27 January 2000. Closing date for receipt of applications was 10 March 2000. Applications are currently being assessed in the regional offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>Community groups seeking funding under the various grants schemes operated by my Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department must establish the extent to which groups, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a large number of applications have been received, it is not possible at present to indicate <Col N="1498" /> the number, location or possible beneficiaries of grant aid. Groups will be advised by the relevant regional office on the position of their application as soon as all applications have been assessed. Details of all grants made under the various schemes have been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year to 1999 for the information of members. Details of all the 2000 grants will be likewise made available early in 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325, 326 and 329 together.</P>
      <P>While the latest published monthly CSO report on the consumer price index highlights that in the year to February 2000 inflation increased by 4.3%, the Minister for Finance in his budget statement has estimated that the annual average inflation rate for the whole of 2000 will be 3%. The recent social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £428 million. on a full year basis, provides for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66, including widow/er's pensioners and lone parents over 66; a special increase of £5.90 a week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years; and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66, including widow/er's pensioners and lone parents under 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%. With an expected annual average inflation rate of 3% for 2000, this year's increases will be ahead of expected inflation, representing real increases ranging between 2.1% and 5.7%. As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all of these increases are being paid four <Col N="1499" /> weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed in its action programme to providing substantial social welfare increases. Specifically, the recent review of the action programme has committed the Government to bringing forward from 2002 the target date for increasing the old age contributory pension to £100 a week and to extending the commitment to achieving this target rate to all social welfare pensions for older people by 2002. The Government is also committed to ensuring that over its term of office all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings.</P>

      <P>The 2000 budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million in the child benefit scheme. From September of this year, the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second children will be increased by £8 and the higher rate, payable in respect of the third and subsequent children will be increased by £10, bringing the rates up to £42.50 and £56 respectively. This very substantial investment represents projected real increases of 19.6% for the lower rate of child benefit and 18.2% for the higher rate.</P>
      <P>The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commits the Government to further substantially increasing the rates of child benefit over the period of the programme, with a priority focus on reaching £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>Significant expenditure is required to make Lucan Demesne fully accessible to the public and accordingly my Department sought and received approval from the Department of Finance for expenditure of £3.75 million on the development of the demesne over the next five years, commencing this year. This funding will be allocated to the three county councils involved, Kildare, Fingal and South Dublin on the basis of an agreed programme of works.</P>
      <P>The sanction from the Department of Finance is subject to a maximum payment each year of £750,000 up to 2004 and the three local authorities involved formally acknowledging that these payments represent the maximum amounts to be made available through my Department for the development of Lucan Demesne. This funding is also conditional upon the agreement of the local authorities to open as much of the demesne as possible to the public as early as possible for obvious reasons. The three local authorities have given an absolute assurance that they would in future cover all maintenance and running costs of the proposed park from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that through the purchase of the demesne and the provision of development funding, my Department is providing very substantial assistance to the local authorities to ensure the establishment of a Liffey Valley Park to provide much needed amenity facilities both for local communities and the public at large. My particular concern is to ensure that the Lucan Demesne be made available to the public as soon as possible and I would urge the two local authorities who have yet to confirm their acceptance of the conditions attached to the grant of development funding to do so, in order to facilitate commencement of the development works without delay.</P>

      <P>There has been no recent communication from the Japanese government in relation to whaling issues.</P>
      <P>The International Whaling Commission is the international forum for the control and regulation of whaling. Both Ireland and Japan are represented at the IWC by whaling commissioners and continuous formal and informal contact takes place between the respective commissioners in relation to whaling issues. Also, the Japanese Government contacts my Department from time to time explaining and seeking support for its position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of my continuing concern in relation to the number of whales taken by countries , including Japan, who are members <Col N="1505" /> of the International Whaling Commission. However, I am advised the whaling carried out by Japan is legal and in accordance with the International Convention on the regulation of Whaling. Article VIII of this convention provides that any member country has the right to take whales for the purposes of scientific research and Japan chooses to exercise its rights under article VIII.</P>
    <P>The compromise proposals put forward for discussion by Ireland at the 1997 meeting of the International Whaling Commission provided <i>inter alia</i> for the phasing out of lethal scientific whaling. While member countries have engaged positively in the process of discussion and debate in relation to these compromise proposals put forward by Ireland, the difficulties in achieving consensus within the IWC remain considerable.</P>

      <P>Inspections of archaeological excavations carried out by my officials have revealed that there are cases where the standard of work is below that which would be expected from the profession.</P>
      <P>Instances of work falling below standard are outlined in a tabular statement which has been forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should also point the Deputy to the further evidence for sub-standard work which is contained in the heritage council's recent report Review of Archaeological Assessment and Monitoring Procedures in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems are caused by the failure of developers to arrange for archaeological testing to be carried out at the earliest possible stages <Col N="1508" /> in the planning of their developments. Far too often, insufficient notice is given to the archaeologist of the date on which sites become available. In addition, the amount of development work now taking place means that there is an ever increasing demand on the archaeological profession and a consequent tendency to rush through, test excavations in particular, with an inevitable fall in standards.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for more inspections of archaeological excavations and for more detailed guidelines on the correct procedure and practices to be followed for testing and on the production of reports. A seminar on these matters would be of benefit and has been recommended in the heritage council report. For my part, I am in the process of recruiting additional archaeologists coupled with repositioning existing resources so as to introduce a systematic programme of site inspections, to undertake the production of guidelines and to hold a series of follow-up seminars. I am confident that these measures will have a beneficial effect on the standard of archaeological work among the profession as well as serving the best interests of the development sector and all those with an interest in preserving our heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities are fully committed to the ongoing development of community policing in the context of providing a continuously improving policing service. The annual policing plan for 2000 provides for a refocusing on the role of community gardaí, more <Col N="1512" /> neighbourhood policing in large urban areas and commitments to expand community based schemes, such as Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, Business Watch and Campus Watch. While I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans for the introduction of a community policing model in Kilkenny city, I can say that plans for a youth diversion project in the city are under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced the allocation of £16 million in funding over the next six years under the national development plan for the significant expansion of the Garda youth diversion programme in both urban and rural areas. These projects aim, through a combination of intervention and preventive actions, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity and its consequences. The long-term objective is to enable the target group of ten to 18 year olds to integrate into the labour force in a systematic manner and to prevent them from becoming unemployable.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to implement the proposal for expanding the number of projects on a phased basis over the life of the plan. Locations are currently being considered, having regard to the local needs as assessed by the Garda Síochána in conjunction with my Department. A proposal for a project in Kilkenny is among those currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to finalise details shortly in relation to the first phase of this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 376 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise the Deputies that my Department will be operating a number of funding measures under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006. The funding will be aimed, in the context of the national development plan, at increasing the quantity of child care places and improving the quality of child care services, including capital grants to non-profit organisations and community groups to establish, upgrade or enhance child care facilities; staffing grants to non-profit organisations and community groups towards the employment of trained child care personnel; capital grants for self-employed <Col N="1515" /> child care service providers catering for up to twenty child care places; supports for training initiatives; grants to enhance the services of the national voluntary child care organisations; and grants towards the development of local child care networks.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to advertise the following measures under my Department's Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 in the national press at the end of April: capital grants for community based-not for profit child care providers; staffing grants for community based-not for profit child care providers; capital grants for self-employed child care providers catering for up to 20 child care places.</P>
    <P>The criteria and the eligibility requirements for the measures being provided under the programme are being developed at present. The application forms and guidelines for these initiatives are at the design stage and will shortly be going to print.</P>
    <P>Following promotion of these schemes, application forms and guidelines will be available from my Department's equal opportunities child care section. It is envisaged that the application process will be open-ended thus allowing prospective applicants adequate time to prepare their proposals.</P>
    <P>An appraisal process for the various measures is being established which will take into account various factors such as the location of the facility, cost-effectiveness and the overall quality of the proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> The funding measures being put in place over the course of the national development plan will ensure that the objectives of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 are met. The range of these measures will ensure that the supply of quality child care will be increased, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and that these facilities will benefit from staffing supports for qualified child care workers. At the same time there is provision in the new programme to support the smaller private child care providers. This will allow both the community based and private child care sectors to grow to meet the demand for child care in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that most divisions in my Department and offices-agencies operating under the aegis of my Department do not operate a time restriction policy on the availability of staff to take calls from the public during their normal office hours. However, there are two exceptions which are set out below.</P>
      <P>Prior to the beginning of November 1999 the citizenship division of my Department operated a telephone helpline which was available between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 p.m., Monday to Friday. At present, this service is available between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday and it appears to be operating satisfactorily. It was felt that the revised hours would be adequate to deal with queries from the public and that this would be less disruptive to the division, thus allowing more time for the processing of applications which is obviously its key function. During the coming months, the situation will be monitored with the view to revising the situation, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The visa section of my Department operates a visa helpline on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. This enables staff resources during other times to be devoted exclusively to processing applications with a view to keeping processing time to a minimum, given that a visa is often required at short notice. The arrangement is, however, being kept under review having regard to the availability of resources and the volume of applications received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the management of the Land Registry reluctantly decided, as an interim measure, to restrict enquiries to the Dublin based offices dealing with Counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and Wicklow to one hour between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. each day for a three month period starting on the 10 January, <Col N="1518" /> 2000. Normal telephone service to members of the public has been resumed with effect from 10 April.</P>
    <P>The initiative was successful in freeing staff from numerous non essential queries. It minimised the disruption caused by the continuous phone calls from clients on a variety of issues and freed up resources to allow cases on hand to be processed.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that Ballyfermot was included as part of Dublin metropolitan region south up until 1996 and as part of Dublin metropolitan region west since 1997.</P>

      <P>I am informed, in this regard, that the allocation of Garda personnel and resources to an individual area is carried out with due regard for a number of factors in the various Garda districts throughout the country.

      <P>population &ndash; geographical area &ndash; crimes reported per annum &ndash; number of road traffic accidents involving personal injury &ndash; number of stolen cars received and depreciation indicators.</P>
      <P>While the above factors have particular relevance in assisting with the efficient and equitable allocation of personnel, different Garda districts have differing attendant sources of the above variables and it is the overall balance of these, and not individual indicators taken in isolation, which prescribe the recommended allocation of available resources.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the allocation of personnel to areas is constantly under review and that when personnel next become available the needs of County Kildare will be fully considered in the overall context of other Garda divisions-districts throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the use of illicit drugs is a nationwide problem, the young people's facilities and services fund has focused primarily on the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse in Dublin and Cork city, the local drugs task force areas, and on other selected urban areas where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, such as Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Bray and Carlow.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, the focus of the national drugs strategy, of which the young people's facilities and services fund is part, has been on tackling the heroin problem, in view of its public health implications and close association with crime. However, funding is also available to a range of State agencies, including the health boards, to respond to the drug problem outside the local drugs task force areas. This funding is available to the agencies not only to deliver their own plans, but also to enable them to support community and voluntary groups in responding to the problems in their areas.</P>
      <P>In the case of the South Eastern Health Board region, I understand that the regional health board's co-ordinating committee on drugs has established local co-ordinating committees in each community care area, including Wexford, with representation from relevant agencies and local interests, including the Wexford area partnership company, to develop a local integrated response to the drug problem. I would suggest that the partnership proposal should be considered in this context in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have also initiated a review of the overall national drugs strategy. The review will examine the extent and nature of the drug problem throughout the country, with a view to recommending any necessary changes to the current strategy before year end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 417 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of children killed either boarding or leaving school buses in the past ten years is being assembled and will be forwarded to him as soon as possible. The school transport section of my Department is not aware of a recent warning by the association of general practitioners regarding the matter, however, details will be sought and taken into account in relation to the question of safety matters.</P>
      <P>A flashing lights system is in operation in the USA and Canada. Regulations in operation in those countries require all traffic, in both directions, to stop whenever school children are boarding or leaving school buses. This is facilitated by the fact that vehicles in those countries are built to a standard specification with regard to colour and advance warning systems.</P>
      <P>My Department and Bus Éireann previously looked into the possibility of introducing such a system in Ireland, but found that there are a number of disadvantages which make it difficult to apply that system to school bus operators in this country. Vehicles operating on school transport in this country consist of various types and sizes, ranging from cars to coaches and a large number of pupils are carried on public scheduled services. A high proportion of school buses are provided by private contractors engaged by Bus Éireann and in addition are used for other passenger services. Confusion could arise among road users if some vehicles used by school children have flashing lights, and others have not. A disadvantage is the traffic chaos that could result if other vehicles are not permitted to pass a school bus, especially in urban areas and at peak times. This could render the current situation more hazardous. The safety drill for this would be contrary to long standing safety instructions familiar to Irish pupils. Under current safety instructions, pupils should wait until the school bus has moved off before attempting to cross the road.</P>
      <P>Designated vehicles, owned by both Bus Éireann and contractors, are fitted with signs to identify them as school buses, that is the international symbol for school children. Every effort is made to highlight safety aspects. The need for care and the observance of safety rules are continuously emphasised to pupils, parents and teachers, and safety campaigns are undertaken regularly. On school bus tickets, Bus Éireann list the safety rules to be followed before joining, <i>en route </i>and after alighting from the bus. School principals are requested to speak to pupils on the topic of safety on a regular basis, and special leaflets are distributed from time to time, to all pupils on transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instructions to school bus drivers emphasise the importance of safety and includes a special instruction to constantly remind pupils to exercise the greatest care in crossing roads when boarding or alighting from school buses. In addition, a <Col N="1527" /> safety notice is placed at exit doors as a reminder to pupils as they leave the bus.</P>
    <P>The whole question of safety in relation to school buses, including the question of flashing lights, will be examined again, in the context of the examination of the report of the joint Oireachtas committee on school transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 408 together.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of children with autism. Arising from this development, special dedicated provision is now made available for such children at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Each special class also has the support of a child care assistant. To date, more than 50 special classes have been established to provide dedicated educational support for children with autism and my Department is currently pursuing the establishment of additional special classes in a number of locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In some cases, parents of children with special needs, including autism, may wish their children to attend school on a fully integrated basis. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all such children within the primary system now have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs. The response may take the form of extra teacher or extra child care support or both, depending on the needs of the individual child. Already, as a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from 104 to 329 and the number of child care assistants has grown from 295 to 937.</P>
      <P>In the particular case of children with autism, there is also a need for additional support services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. These services are provided on an outreach basis through the relevant health authorities, including through the Beechpark facility to which the Deputy refers. My Department works in close co-operation with the health authorities in arranging to have these services put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of special support <Col N="1528" /> services made available by my Department offers an adequate response to the needs of children with autism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the school referred to by the Deputy declined to participate in the in-career development programme organised to support the implementation of the revised primary school curriculum. I recently met the principal of the school to discuss this and a range of other issues.</P>
      <P>When my Department became aware of the school's position in November last, a letter issued to the school extending an open invitation to the staff to attend phase 1 in career development seminars at any time up to the completion date of mid-February 2000. In the event, the school did not take up this offer. I have been made aware very recently that the school has now declined an invitation to participate in phase 2 seminars, due for completion by the end of the school year.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the school is that it is currently involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement with another primary school under the 1978 scheme for the employment of secretaries in primary schools. There is no provision at the moment for the appointment of full-time secretaries in posts that are being shared. In addition to the shared secretary arrangement, the school had up to this year been receiving an additional <i>per capita </i>grant of £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services, under the PESP scheme that was introduced in 1992.</P>
      <P>In view of the increased allocation that has been made available this year, and effective from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils became eligible for a grant towards caretaking services under this scheme.  I also increased the rate of grant by 33% to £20 per pupil. This has resulted in the grant for caretaking services to the school referred to by the Deputy increasing from £5,190 in 1999 to £6,880 this year. My Department has already issued the increased grants to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, with effect from January 2001, all <Col N="1531" /> primary schools will become eligible for grant assistance under this scheme. My Department is issuing a circular to all to all schools on this matter this week.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, in framing proposals for the spending of the allocation, which increased from approximately £5.6 million in 1999 to £11.2 million this year, it was necessary for me to examine means of ensuring that all schools would receive assistance from my Department in respect of both secretarial and caretaking assistance. The scheme that I have put in place will mean that from January of 2001 all primary schools will, for the first time, be receiving grant assistance in respect of these services from my Department. The increase of 33% in the rate of grant also means that schools that were already receiving assistance have had their grant levels significantly increased.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for me to put separate provision in place for the school referred to by the Deputy. The school has benefited from the enhanced scheme that has now been put in place. I am committed to seeking further improvements in the resources available to schools in respect of secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the school cannot see its way to participating in the incareer development programme associated with the implementation of the revised curriculum and I would urge the school to reconsider its stance in this regard.</P>

      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department. My officials are also engaged in a process of consultation with interested groups. This process will be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The initial priority will be to establish structures to oversee detailed implementation of the White Paper. Decisions on these structures will be taken following the initial planning and consultation process.</P>
      <P>Section 54 of the Education Act, 1998, provides for the establishment of bodies to provide services related to education. Accordingly, it is not anticipated that further legislation will be required in respect of the White Paper structures.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the qualifications of teachers for involvement in early childhood education will be made in the context of a national qualifications framework for the early childhood sector. Work on the framework will be undertaken in consultation with the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, early childhood education providers and organisations involved in the provision of early childhood education courses, following the establishment of appropriate structures in the area.</P>

      <P>The transition year guidelines state that &ldquo;a clearly documented programme is essential for ongoing review and for effective internal eval<Col N="1534" /> uation of the programme in the school&rdquo;. The Guidelines, which provide the official framework for all individual transition year programmes, go on to say that this written programme should be reviewed annually, revised where appropriate and retained in the school for inspection by the inspectorate of my Department. In a small number of schools inspected in the past two years, the inspectors found an inadequate or out-of-date written programme. Circular M1/00, issued in January 2000, reminds schools of the regulation that a comprehensive written programme must be provided. This circular directed schools to the document, Writing the Transition Year Programme, produced jointly by the inspectorate and by the transition year curriculum support service.</P>
      <P>At present the document Writing the Transition Year Programme is primarily intended for the co-ordinator and teachers of the programme in schools. The document should, of course, be available for consultation by parents in all schools offering the transition year programme. However, should schools require further copies of the document for parents of transition year students, my Department will make them available on request.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 301 of 4 April 2000, the resources he has allocated to locate the missing cassette recording; the way in which this tape has been misplaced; and the recourse available in this case.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the response to Question No. 301, the practice of taping all the candidates in the oral Irish part of the Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge was introduced in April 1999 so that a record of the examination would be available in the case of appeals. The procedure has been that each of the oral examiners sends his/her tapes to the chief examiner for forwarding to the primary <Col N="1535" /> administration section of the Department in Athlone. Unfortunately the particular cassette relating to this individual's examination has been mislaid in this process. All persons involved in this process have been requested again to check their files and offices in an effort to locate the tape.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department in a letter dated 22 March, offered to make an inspector available to meet with the person in question to offer advice on any aspect of the oral Irish examination. Furthermore the examiner's notes in relation to the October examination will also be made available to the person. A response to this letter has not, as yet, been received within my Department.</P>
      <P>I would reiterate, however, that the fact that the tape has not been located does not in any way invalidate the results of the examination. The marks were awarded by the examiner on the basis of the candidate's performance on the occasion of the oral Irish examination and not on a later listening to the cassette recording.</P>

      <P>Of the remaining 174 schools the RPII advised that 13 schools, showing the highest level of radon, require attention as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. To date he has inspected all thirteen and made recommendations on a mitigation programme in respect of five. Details of the mitigation programme for the other eight schools are expected shortly.</P>

Under this scheme my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>I recently announced improvements in this scheme whereby all schools with 100 pupils or more receive annual grant assistance from this Department at the rate of £40 per pupil, £20 in respect of secretarial assistance and £20 in respect of caretaking assistance. My Department recently issued these grants to all qualifying schools.</P>
      <P>While the school referred to by the Deputy has been in receipt of grant assistance under this scheme for the past number of years, the rate of the grant this year has increased from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil. This means that the annual grant allocated to the school has increased from £15,000 to £20,000. The Deputy will appreciate that this is an increase of 33% in funding to this school in respect of this scheme. I am sure that this additional funding will assist the school in putting adequate structures in place in respect of secretarial services.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will fund a group project to assist autistic children along the lines of a pilot group funded by his predecesor in Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Miniter for Education and cience (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The CABAS project in Cork is a pilot programme which is delivering an applied behavioural analysis approach to the education of children with autism. The project is catering for 12 children with autism. The project was established in 1999 and will operate for a five-year test period, following which the effectiveness of the approach as a means of catering for children with autism will be assessed. The question of funding further such projects will be considered in the light of the outcome of the evaluation of the CABAS project.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of children with autism. Arising from this development, special dedicated provision is now made available for such children at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Each special class also has the support of a child care assistant. To date, more than 50 special classes have been established to provide dedicated educational support for children with autism and my Department is currently pursuing the establishment of additional special classes in a number of locations throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, parents of children with special needs, including children with autism, may wish their children to attend school on a fully inte<Col N="1541" /> grated basis. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all such children now have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs. The response may take the form of extra teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the individual child. Already as a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from 104 to 329 and the number of child care assistants has grown from 295 to 937.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of children with autism, there is also a need for additional support services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. These services are provided by the relevant health authorities and my Department works closely with these authorities to ensure that the necessary supports are made available.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping my Department's response to the needs of children with autism under ongoing review to ensure that adequate support services are made available to the children in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures have been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>Persons who hold a primary degree may apply for admission to a post graduate course conducted by the primary teacher training colleges. These courses are conducted when it is deemed necessary to increase the supply of qualified primary teachers and there are currently two such courses being conducted. The courses, which are generally of 18 months duration, enable a primary degree holder become fully qualified for appointment in a primary school. There are no proposals to establish a crash course to enable persons without a degree serving as unqualified substitute or temporary teachers gain recognition as fully qualified primary teachers.</P>

      <P>Currently, my Department will grant restricted recognition to teach in special schools and classes to certain teachers who have not graduated in the normal manner from the colleges of education in Ireland. These teachers include teachers who trained outside the State, teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College, Milltown, Dublin 14 and teachers with the national degree or diploma in humanities in Montessori education from St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire. This restricted recognition also allows the teachers outlined above to take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resource teachers form a very important part of the educational system and it is appropriate <Col N="1543" /> that they would possess qualifications that would enable them to carry out their tasks in an effective manner.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Four sections in my Department are currently limiting the service that can be provided directly to telephone callers on an ongoing basis. The sections involved are teachers' pensions section, the student support unit, primary payments section and the post primary building unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each case, the limitation of service takes the form of dealing directly with telephone enquiries <Col N="1544" /> only for a set number of hours per day. At other times during the day, callers receive information from a recorded message. The restrictions in the student support unit, post primary building unit and primary payments section commenced in 1999. The restrictions were introduced in pensions section in September 1997 and were notified to teachers at the outset.</P>
    <P>Other sections in my Department have placed occasional restrictions on telephone answering services from time to time to deal with bottlenecks in the workload. These restrictions have tended to be limited in scope and short in duration. For example, teachers' salaries sections have occasionally found it necessary to divert telephones to an answering service on the day before a critical payroll deadline, particularly where salary arrears payments were being made.</P>
    <P>These restrictions are used as a last resort because the volume of queries being received by telephone leaves little time available to staff to process claims, written correspondence and other work. Naturally, I am not happy with any diminution of service to the public and I am keeping the situation under review with a view to eliminating the need to have any restrictions placed on telephone services to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an educational psychologist will be appointed to work in primary schools in Waterford in the current calendar year. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently completing the process of recruiting additional suitably qualified psychologists and, as a result, my Department will be in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year. This will double the present number of psychologists in NEPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national policy advisory board of NEPS has been set up to advise me on the development of the agency. All the main client groups and other <Col N="1548" /> providers of psychological services are represented on this board and they will be advising me, through the management committee, on possible strategies to meet the current need for psychological support in schools, taking account of evidence of disadvantage, incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services. In the interest of equity, it is proposed that new psychologists will be distributed on a pro rata basis among the regions until each has reached its target number, which will be determined by the evidence of need. The management team in NEPS has been collecting relevant data on the needs of each county and will supplement this with local discussions. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to NEPS by the end of 2004.</P>

However, officials of my Department have met with representatives of the society in relation to a variety of issues, including the development of literacy schemes for deaf people for which funding of £607,000 is being made available over a five year period.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has recently forwarded its observations on the proposal to establish a Centre for Deaf Studies at Trinity College Dublin. The proposal is now under consideration within my Department.</P>
      <P>I would of course be prepared to meet with representatives of the society at a mutually convenient time if such a meeting would be helpful.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the terms of reference of the Commission on Child Sexual Abuse to allow for investigation of complaints of persons up to 21 years old rather than the existing proposal to investigate matters to the age of 18 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In establishing the commission to inquire into child abuse last year on an administrative basis the Government decided to set out very broad terms of reference for the commission and asked them to report on those terms and any amendments they wished to make to them and on the powers they would need to carry out the terms. The commission after careful consideration of all the issues made their final report to the Government in October 1999. In that report the commission recommended that the word &ldquo;childhood&rdquo; should be defined as meaning the period of a person's life up to the age of 18 years. The Government accepted this recommendation, as it did all the other recommendations of the commission and it is not now proposed to amend it. While the legal age of majority was 21 for a large part of the period which will be inquired into by the commission, the purpose of the commission is to inquire into the abuse of people who due to their age and lack of life experience were particularly vulnerable. In setting the age at 18 in my view the commission and the subsequent Bill has set a reasonable balance which will ensure that a full and detailed inquiry can be conducted into the abuse of the most vulnerable children and young people in an effective and efficient manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation to which the Deputy refers involves two separate schools, one of which is a junior school and one of which is a senior school. Neither of the schools in question has been designated as disadvantaged under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>However, the junior school is included in the rural phase of the breaking the cycle of disadvantage initiative. This initiative is focused on primary schools in rural areas with fewer than five teachers. Schools were selected for inclusion in the initiative on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic criteria devised by the educational research centre. The junior school in question secured inclusion in breaking the cycle on the basis of data submitted in respect of its pupils. The senior school was not eligible for inclusion because of its staffing level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the <Col N="1551" /> needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage within the primary system.</P>
    <P>As a first step in this process, the educational research centre has recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the schools to which the Deputy refers. Responses from schools will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school. Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
    <P>I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.

In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of bachelor of education, on the basis that these courses in Ireland were subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>
