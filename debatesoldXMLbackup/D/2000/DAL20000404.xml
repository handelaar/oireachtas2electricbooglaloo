        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister of State for his reply. How do the figures regarding single motherhood in Ireland, where the number of children born outside marriage increased from one in every five six years ago to one in every three last year, compare to figures in other EU countries? Does he have that statistic to hand?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the international comparative figures. However, I will get them and bring them to the Deputy's attention. As the <Col N="426" /> Deputy said, there is a definite trend. In 1995, 22% of all births were to unmarried mothers. Last year the figure was 31% while in 1980 it was 5%. Therefore, it has risen from 5% in 1980 to 31% in 1999. It is interesting to note that, in 1998, 46% of all births in the Dublin area were to unmarried mothers. That figure will probably approach 50% this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting idea and I will ask the CSO to consider the inclusion of such a question. It is also interesting that, in 1980, 40% of all births to unmarried mothers were to teenagers. By 1998, of the total number of babies born to unmarried mothers, only 20% were born to teenagers. This shows that the number of teenage mothers is decreasing.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office will carry out a census of agriculture on 1 June 2000 in compliance with Council Regulation (EU) No. 2467/96. The census will collect information on livestock, crops, labour input, farm machinery and miscellaneous agricultural activity for all farms in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the rapidly declining population in rural areas and the fact that we are within five years of the virtual dismantling of the CAP, will the Minister of State indicate whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and other Departments have considered the inclusion of other data in the census so that we might obtain a more detailed profile of life in rural areas and better inform our policy making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the Deputy's suggestion of including other data to the attention of the relevant Departments. This year's census of agriculture will be carried out by post. In previous years it was carried out by means of a field operation. The change has come about due to fin<Col N="427" /> ancial considerations and also because it is a statutory inquiry, and participation will be compulsory. I will bring to the attention of the relevant Departments the need to include as many as possible of the type of questions which will yield the information to which the Deputy referred. I do not have first hand knowledge of the range of questions included in the census.</P>
      <P>The last census of agriculture was undertaken in June 1991 and, as stated earlier, the next one is due shortly. Until 1980, such censuses were compiled every five years and, subsequently, they have been compiled every ten years. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will take questions later and he may have further views to offer on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I was referring to the creation of a statistical database from which we could construct well-informed and focused policy. It is obvious the number of people involved in agriculture will decline to a low level and I wonder if the Minister of State would perhaps consider referring the draft census to the National Economic and Social Forum or the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to allow them to investigate the inclusion of the additional questions to which I refer. This census is only carried out once every ten years and provides a mere snapshot in time. If we want to address the problems faced by rural communities &ndash; these do not relate exclusively to agriculture &ndash; we need to obtain as much information as possible and this is a unique opportunity to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will encourage the CSO to collect as much information as possible. The Deputy should remember that the census in question relates to livestock and is dedicated to collecting information on livestock, crops, farm machinery and miscellaneous agricultural activity. Therefore, it has more to do with agricultural produce than with the number of people involved in agriculture. Information on the latter can be found in the Central Statistics Office's quarterly surveys.</P>
      <P>There is a regular flow of information about the numbers engaged in agriculture and the trends in that sector. I will certainly have a look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee met on two occasions during this Dáil term. Meetings took place on Thursday, 27 January, and Wednesday, 24 February 2000. The meeting scheduled for Tuesday, 21 March, was postponed until Wednesday, 12 April, as the Taoiseach was travelling to the special European Council in Lisbon on that day.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee continues to give political direction to the national drugs strategy and the young people's facilities and services fund. The meetings provide an opportunity to review trends, assess progress in the relevant strategies and programmes and resolve any policy and organisational problems which may arise. At its two meetings during this Dáil term, the Cabinet sub-committee noted the progress made in implementing these initiatives which are aimed at addressing the drug problem in a targeted manner.</P>
      <P>At its meeting in February, the sub-committee considered the report of the interim advisory committee on drugs which was established, <i>inter alia</i>, to make recommendations on the role, structure and composition of a national advisory committee which would have continuing responsibility for research and information on drug misuse in Ireland. This matter will shortly be submitted to Government for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister of State well on his appointment. He says the Cabinet sub-committee met on two occasions and noted progress in different areas. Does he not think the time has come for the Cabinet to give new political direction, having regard to the anecdotal evidence that hundreds of young people in this city are still on a waiting list for access to the methadone programme? What is the Minister of State's best assessment of the number of drug abusers awaiting access to that programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of the national drugs strategy will take place shortly. The terms of reference of the review are currently being finalised and I hope to take them to the meeting next week. It is hoped the review will be completed by the end of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 4,400 people on the methadone maintenance programme at present. Some people claim there are up to 13,000 people awaiting access to the programme but nobody <Col N="429" /> knows the exact number. The only way we will know that is when sufficient services are available so that when somebody seeks help they will be given immediate access to the services. There are nearly 50 drug clinics throughout the city, a high number compared with the figure for a few years ago.</P>
    <P>A couple of days after I was appointed to office a journalist challenged me to prove there were 13,000 addicts; he did not believe the number approached that. We will know the figure when the services are available so people can avail of treatment when they want it. We are approaching that objective and I like to think we will be close to it by the end of the year. There was local resistance to the establishment of methadone maintenance clinics and that slowed the process. However, that resistance is not as strong now. People realise that if they look after local drug addicts in their locality, it will not lead to the problems which occurred in areas where huge numbers of addicts were being treated. There were many problems outside these large clinics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the best advice available to the Minister of State indicates that the number of drug abusers might be as high as 13,000 in this city alone. The gap between that and the number of people on the methadone programme is enormous. Have we not reached the stage where there ought to be a better assessment of the number? Does the Minister of State intend to take new steps to deal with the gaps in the treatment infrastructure?</P>
      <P>There has been considerable enhancement of community based clinics. However, the gap between the 4,000 people on methadone maintenance programmes and 13,000 abusers in this city alone is enormous. Can the Minister offer hope to those areas which, through ignorance or otherwise, have resisted the installation of community based treatment clinics and give a commitment that the network will be completed as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to everybody, including Members of this House, to back health boards when they set up methadone maintenance clinics in local areas. Generally most people do. It is not an easy task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have a word with the people behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies and other politicians stick together at local level the problems with the maintenance programme can be overcome because it is working. The programme is making life much easier for the addicts, their families and communities. It is a first step and we need to examine ways of moving people away from methadone and on to a drug free life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the national drugs strategy will cover many of the questions raised. Its purpose is to review the strategy and identify gaps or <Col N="430" /> deficiencies. It will also develop or revise strategies and, if necessary, identify new structures to deliver them. The review will identify the latest available data on the nature and extent of problem drug use in the country as a whole, emerging trends and drug use in areas with the greatest level of problem drug use. It will also outline the current national drugs strategy, including the role of the statutory agencies, the community and voluntary sector in terms of supply reduction, education prevention and awareness, risk reduction, treatment and rehabilitation, inter-agency co-ordination and integration and community and voluntary sector participation in the design and delivery of the strategies.</P>
    <P>The review will also examine the impact of the national drugs strategy across the headings listed in the context of the objectives set out for it and the resources allocated to date, identify major gaps and deficiencies presented across these headings, examine international trends, developments and best practice models and, in the light of the foregoing, consider how the national drugs strategy, including the structures involved in its development and delivery, can be revised or modified to meet the gaps and deficiencies identified and make recommendations to the Government before the end of September. Fora will be available to people to enable them express their views. People will also be asked to make written submissions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Cabinet sub-committee aware that while progress has been made, much more needs to be done? Is it also aware that with regard to the initial stages of treating heroin addicts, rehabilitation and after care is still a major problem? Does the Minister of State agree the Government must put much more funding, thought and personnel into this area? None of us wants thousands of addicts to remain on methadone. Rehabilitation and after care would provide the structure, support and means whereby they could come off methadone, which has bad side effects.</P>
      <P>Is the Cabinet sub-committee also aware that in the Dublin area there is a problem recruiting sufficient numbers of doctors trained in heroin addiction treatment and that more urgent measures are needed to ensure there are sufficient doctors to cover every part of the greater Dublin area?</P>
      <P>Is the Cabinet sub-committee aware that there is a problem with community pharmacists playing a full role in the treatment of heroin addicts and that there is a reluctance on the part of some? Does the Minister of State agree that pharmacists have as much a moral obligation and responsibility to provide whatever assistance and support is needed to those in our society who are addicted to heroin as they do to people who suffer other illnesses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and, now that I have taken on responsibility for this area, I would like to see much more resources being <Col N="431" /> devoted to rehabilitation and after care. A first step has been taken in putting people on a methadone maintenance programme which places some order on the chaotic lives they lead. However, it is only the first step and people must move on from that through rehabilitation, counselling and other programmes where other drugs will be used. There are other ways of getting people off heroin or methadone and living a drug-free life. I agree with the Deputy that it is important.</P>
      <P>Michael Farrell, who is based in the National Addiction Centre in London, conducted an assessment of Eastern Health Board services and found that 40% of those on a methadone maintenance programme were returning to work. There are positive signs and we should ensure that those positive signs are sent out to addicts so they will know that, if they go on a methadone maintenance programme, there will be light at the end of the tunnel. FÁS has ring fenced about 1,000 places for training. There are developments but I would like to see more happen in the area.</P>
      <P>I agree there is a problem with some pharmacists and doctors who are not properly trained. I gather the health board is trying to deal with that at present. It is something of which the health board is conscious and which it has raised with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my constituency colleague. This is the first opportunity I have had on the floor of the House during Question Time to acknowledge his long overdue appointment to the Government ranks.</P>
      <P>The next stage beyond methadone is an assisted path back into the paid employed workforce. While the Minister of State indicated that FÁS has ring fenced up to 1,000 training places, does he agree that a more pro-active approach is needed and we need to break down the prejudice which exists countrywide among employers of all hues and ranks against recovering addicts? Similar prejudice existed 50 years ago against prisoners and that prejudice had to be confronted in a pro-active way. Does the Minister of State envisage undertaking a programme above and beyond what FÁS has done and in conjunction with IBEC, FÁS and the social partners and through the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to proceed to the next step? Unless there is a path into the world of work and remuneration, people will not stay indefinitely on methadone treatment.</P>
      <P>As regards the methadone protocol, perhaps the Minister of State may have available to him in his supplementary information the number of doctors who signed up to adhere to the methadone protocol and if he believes that more doctors are needed to facilitate this dispersal of the process throughout the areas where drugs are used to prevent the process from being demonised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the number of doctors but I know that it is causing a certain <Col N="432" /> amount of concern. There is a reluctance on the part of some doctors to deal with people who are on a methadone maintenance programme for the obvious reasons that they do not want them to be seen in their clinics as it may deter other patients. The health board is conscious of that and is trying to address it. The ideal is that people would go to their GP and receive their methadone.</P>
      <P>Regarding employment and training and getting people back into the workforce, I agree that issue must be pushed strongly. I am sure if employers were approached properly they would like to employ people who are trained. I was in Deputy Rabbitte's constituency last Friday and I saw the number of young people being trained to be computer literate. They were extremely positive about what they were doing and about their future employment prospects. We must break the prejudice and show people that just because someone was a heroin addict&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State is responsible for the drugs programme, does he have any plans to meet the Garda Commissioner or the Garda authorities? Does he agree that people who go out at night with balaclavas and use bully boy tactics to deal with the problem of drug abuse are only exacerbating the problem? Does he agree that tracts of working class Dublin which are afflicted by this problem are inadequately policed and are inviting others to sort out the problem, so to speak? Law abiding parents who are fearful of their children falling into the clutches of the drug pushers sometimes welcome the problem being dealt with by undemocratic and brutal tactics. Will the Minister of State seek a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and the Garda authorities on this pressing problem in certain working class areas of Dublin? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought a meeting with the Garda authorities and they will shortly inform me of a date when I can meet them. It is difficult for people living within the law to fight the drugs problem if someone at local level deals with it by using a baseball bat and balaclava. The gardaí have a duty to ensure they fight the drugs problem in these areas. One of the complaints I have received from local drug task forces is that people are selling drugs on street corners and undermining the good work they are doing in providing services. That is one of the reasons I asked for a meeting with the gardaí. I agree with the Deputy that it is difficult for everyone, including public representatives, if people take the law into their own hands. I will highlight this issue when I meet the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also deal with the issue of middle <Col N="433" /> rank drug pushers who have a good lifestyle, although it may not be as good as the more notorious drug pushers, but no obvious source of income. Just because we have dealt with some of the big drug pushers does not mean we should leave the middle men untouched because they will become more notorious in a few years' time.</P>

      <Quest>if costs arising from on-farm certification, associated with the beef assurance scheme, will be levied against farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify the situation regarding the costs arising from certification of farms under the national beef assurance scheme. The Government decision which authorised the drafting of the National Beef Assurance Bill specifically provided that the costs of complying with the conditions of the scheme should be borne by participants and such a provision was included in the Bill. The legislation was introduced in July 1999 and each Stage was debated extensively. There was considerable discussion and consultation with farming and other organisations over a period and, therefore, the purpose and elements of the scheme were well known in advance.</P>
      <P>As regards the inspection and certification arrangements for farms, it is not my intention to impose expensive and bureaucratic procedures on participants. It has always been my intention that the farm inspections required under the scheme should be carried out at the time of the annual herd test in order to minimise costs and inconvenience for farmers. The specific and detailed arrangements for inspections will be finalised through negotiation with the interested parties. In the coming weeks my officials will recommence discussions with farming and veterinary organisations in order to reach agreement on a practical, workable, credible and least costly inspection procedure. There will be ample opportunity to arrive at a sensible and fair system of inspection which will not create an unacceptable burden for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that the State is already making, and will continue to make, a substantial contribution to the cost of the national beef assurance scheme. In the past three years, for example, the Exchequer has invested more than £16 million in the cattle identification and tracing system which is an integral part of the scheme. A further £12.3 million will be spent this year on providing ear tags and cattle passports to farmers and in maintaining and improving the computer system. This <Col N="434" /> will bring total Exchequer spending on beef assurance to more than £28 million in four years. The central requirement is a credible and effective beef assurance scheme which will protect the reputation of the product and give consumers the assurances they require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 Agreement in relation to milk provided greater flexibility to member states in regard to the management of milk quotas and in particular to help active milk producers. Therefore, the changes I introduced by regulation with effect from 1 April will provide greater certainty to active producers, particularly those in the small scale categories. The regulations were drawn up following wide consultation with the different interests in the industry and cover an extensive range of issues relating to quota management. They have been accepted by the industry as progressive and as striking a fair balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the changes covers temporary leasing by persons no longer involved in milk production. <Col N="438" /> It will be no longer possible for such quota holders to temporarily lease their milk quotas where the quotas have been temporarily leased for the preceding three years or longer. However, with effect from 1 April 2000, such quota holders will have the option to resume milk production in their own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year, to sell the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme or to transfer land and quota by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>Provision will also be made under the new restructuring scheme which will enable the heir of a person who sells all of his or her quota into the restructuring pool to have first priority access to an equivalent amount of quota in a subsequent scheme provided that sufficient quota is available.</P>
    <P>I am, however, conscious of the need to cater for people who because of exceptional circumstances cannot resume milk production in the immediate term but intend that they or a successor will resume production within a definite period of time. I will outline in the near future the exceptional circumstances in which exemptions from the general rules may be considered, and the procedures to be followed. </P>

What is the position regarding a person who due to ill health has to opt out of the system for more than three years? I have heard the Minister say on many occasions that such people will be given priority from the restructuring pool. Would the Minister like his livelihood to depend on how a person might interpret a priority in five or ten years' time? What the Minister has outlined does not reflect natural justice. Is he prepared to give a guarantee, signed by the Secretary General and himself, that when a farmer returns to work after a period of ill health or a son or daughter commences milk production on that farm five or ten years later that the quantity of milk quota the farmer sold into the restructuring scheme will be available, irrespective of whether sufficient quota is available?

      <Col N="440" /> With regard to the date for the implementation of EU wide rules, the matter is still under technical discussion and will come before the Council of Ministers before 1 July. In the meantime, Ireland is one of the eight member states with SRM rules already in place and may be joined shortly by a ninth. In the absence of EU common SRM rules, it is not legally possible for one member state to proceed unilaterally and prevent trade in a product that is legally produced in another member state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The western investment fund is considered to constitute a form of State aid and it, therefore, requires the prior approval of the European Commission for its operation. My Department has been in correspondence and discussion with the European Commission since June of last year when a formal request for the <Col N="441" /> appropriate approval was lodged. The Western Development Commission has given every support and assistance to my Department in submitting a case and in responding to requests for clarification.</P>
      <P>When I met Commissioner Fischler in December, I took the opportunity to express my concern at the time being taken by the European Commission in considering the request. I also brought the matter to the attention of Commissioner Byrne and the Government's unhappiness with the slow progress has been communicated to President Prodi's office. Every effort is being made to resolve the matter and to allow the western investment fund to come on stream.</P>
      <P>I am advised there is a good prospect of receiving a favourable decision from the European Commission next week. I am advised by the Western Development Commission that it has 100 inquiries on hand regarding possible assistance from the fund. Some of these would be fully detailed projects capable of being evaluated for aid purposes. I expect any projects on hand will be fully considered and adjudicated on once the fund is operational.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to the western investment fund. Provision of £25 million has been made in the national development plan for this purpose and £5 million is included for it in the budget for my Department for the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister personally met the Commissioner since Christmas and, if so, when? There is outrage in the west. We have had the fanfare of the Ministers and the Taoiseach taking the first Cabinet meeting out of Dublin to Dillon House, Ballaghaderreen. Following that circus funding for the Western Development Commission is still not in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my reply we met the Commissioner before Christmas. Last Friday we met Commissioner Byrne and Commissioner Fischler and we have been in constant contact. There has been a series of queries. We first wrote to them on 15 June. We sought further information and clarification on 11 August and 15 October. Representatives of this Department and the Western Development Commission met the relevant DG4 at their invitation in Brussels on 19 November to clear any issues. Arising from this a further letter from the European Commission issued on 7 December. Despite this no formal response was received until 9 February 2000 when further clarification was sought from the EU. These queries were replied to on 11 February. Following our informal contacts we hope a decision will be made by 12 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I met both Commissioners last week because I was also present at the function. If I had an urgent request and the officials in the Department were not dealing with it, I would make it my business to visit either Minister of State or the Minister. Why has not the Minister <Col N="442" /> of State and his Department &ndash; there is no point in speaking to Commissioner Fischler as he has no responsibility in this area &ndash; taken this matter seriously? It is not that we do not have enough Ministers going to Brussels on a regular basis. Why could not one of the three Ministers go to Brussels to have the problem ironed out given that there are 100 inquiries on hand regarding assistance from this fund? For the past number of years since the Western Development Commission was announced we have been told regularly that the funds will be put in place. I am listening to announcements about the provision of the £25 million and the £5 million for the past three years. When will this fund be up and running and when will it be possible to draw down money from this fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's memory is gone. It is only in the past year and a half that he has heard the announcements about the provision of funds. The legislation was introduced and the money has been put aside for it in the national development plan. The frustration felt by the Western Development Commission is also felt by us in dealing with these matters. The queries have been raised again and again. Because the western investment fund is seen as a form of State aid it is causing us serious problems, including that of the time of officials. I wish to correct the Deputy on one point. I have never seen officials from either the Department of Enterprise and Employment or my own Department spend so much time in Brussels, e.mailing, faxing and in discussions with the European Commission. I resent any implication that they did not do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the officials but rather the Minister of State who has responsibility. The Minister of State should have been in Brussels regularly with a view to getting this fund up and running. As the the old saying goes, live horse and get grass. There are many people with good projects in the west, in a disadvantaged area, waiting for the funds to be put in place. I shall table this question in a month by which time I hope the Minister of State will have met the Commissioner with responsibility in this area and that there will be a positive response, not faxes, e.mails or the Internet. I ask the Minister of State or the Minister to go to Brussels to have this matter dealt with. I am sick and tired of EU regulations when people in the west cannot make a living. While the Government has said a fund is in place we cannot get any money from it.</P>

      <P>Each year, my Department implements a national residue plan for the purpose of detecting a range of illegal residues, including hormones. The laboratory methods used to test samples for the presence of hormones are capable of distinguishing between synthetic and natural hormones. Of 16,233 tests conducted in 1998 and 1999 specifically for hormones, 12, or 0.07%, were positive. Of these positives, five showed a presence of synthetic hormones while natural hormonal substances were indicated in the case of the remainder.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt the degree of testing here is far superior to elsewhere in the European Union. Given that Ireland imports a considerable amount of beef from the United States, Australia and South America, particularly Argentina, is the Minister happy that the testing of beef from those countries is done in accordance with the degree of certainty here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has outlined is of considerable concern. The European Union is actively engaged in scientifically evaluating the testing procedures in various third countries. The WTO finding was that the EU hormone ban, so far as it relates to third country imports of hormone treated meat, did not fully conform to the WTO requirements on scientific risk assessment. Following that finding the EU is engaged in a number of scientific studies. While the results of the bulk of these studies are not yet available, the results of work done so far, which were released last year, have raised serious questions about one particular hormone, oestradiol. In the meantime certain EU exports to the US continue to be subject to&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very alarming state of affairs. Will the Minister agree that the accuracy of the testing where imported beef into the European Union is concerned should be as accurate as the testing at home? It is clear our farmers are victimised and that the countries mentioned are getting the benefit of a lax system. That is not acceptable. I am surprised the farming organisations and the meat processors here have not kicked up about this long ago. It is obvious this has been happening ever since the ban was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A sampling exercise conducted by the EU on imports from the US on hormone free beef and veal revealed a 12% positive level of synthetic hormones. As a result, the EU imposed a mandatory 100% sampling regime on all meat imported from the US and third countries. There is considerable concern about it.</P>

      <P>I do not have details of those countries but the matter the Deputy has raised is one of considerable concern in the EU, and rightly so. We have regimes here for quality beef and yet some is coming in from third countries which do not have the same degree of control.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's amazement. The Opposition put this matter to him on several occasions during the debate on the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill. At that time the Minister appeared to think the controls which were in place outside the beef assurance scheme were sufficient. Today he agrees with Deputy Deasy, as we all do, that what is happening is hugely important and most unfair to Irish producers and consumers. The Minister's new found awareness of this problem surprises me.</P>

      <P>I had very useful meetings with the UK and French ministers of agriculture. I took the opportunity to raise with both of them the current market situation in the sheep sector and the need for reform of the sheepmeat regime. In particular, I stressed the need for a ewe premium system which reflects the significant differences in prices between member states and the need for an extensification premium for sheep. It was agreed that further discussions would take place on a technical basis to explore the preferred outcomes from the review of the operation of the ewe premium system which is currently being carried out by the EU Commission. The review is not expected to be completed until June and any proposals for reform are unlikely to be published before the autumn. I should point out that detailed discussions were held in January between my Department and one of the consultants undertaking the review and he was given a full analysis of the current regime and the adaptation and improvements required to meet Ireland's needs. The consultant was also given the <Col N="445" /> opportunity to be briefed by the sheepmeat monitoring committee.</P>

      <P>We want equity in the ewe premium system; it is not fair that farmers in countries such as France, where sheep prices are 30% higher than in Ireland, get the same ewe premium as Irish farmers. We want the introduction of the extensification premium. It is not fair that sheep are included for numbers but not for payment. We want realignment of the stabiliser; there is no need for that. We want a technical coefficient; southern countries have lighter sheep than we have, yet they get the same premium. Finally, New Zealand imports are too great and must be reduced.</P>

If that is not acceptable, although French farmers seem to get away with a lot compared with Irish farmers who are good Europeans, could a top-up payment be paid to Irish farmers when the price paid to them falls below 90% of the EU average? Would that be an alternative to the present system?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister put in place a retail price monitoring scheme for sheep meat? Has the question of the labelling of Irish lamb been raised at EU level? Would the labelling of Irish lamb, particularly heavy butcher's lamb or lamb processed in abattoirs, ensure Irish rather than imported lamb is consumed in Ireland?</P>

      <P>There is need for reform of the sheep regime. I established a sheep industry review committee last year and a monitoring committee under Professor Crosby is engaged in drawing up recommendations for the future of the sheep industry. Sheep numbers have increased here, in the United Kingdom and particularly in Spain. New Zealand producers are able to undercut European farmers and we must ask how New Zealanders can transport sheep and lamb products from New Zealand to Europe and still undercut our producers. We recognise the problems and they are being examined. I have asked the EU to consider the questions of ewe premia better reflecting the difference in market prices in various member states and the payment of a supplementary ewe premium in member states such as Ireland, where prices are typically 85% less than the rest of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 14, 36 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Agri Food 2010 Committee was established in June 1999. Its terms of reference are, &ldquo;to propose a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the next decade, following the agreement on Agenda 2000, and in the light of the changes and challenges which are likely to evolve nationally and internationally over that period.&rdquo; The committee, which was independent in its operation and findings, consisted of leading figures from all areas of the agri-food sector.</P>
      <P>The committee's report, which was presented to me on 24 March, describes the context in which the sector will have to operate over the next decade, identifies the key issues arising, sets out the committee's vision for the future, and proposes strategies necessary to achieve that vision.</P>
      <P>I consider the Agri Food 2010 Committee report provides a valuable analysis of the future of the agri-food sector. I intend to initiate a round of consultations with all interests in the sector on the detailed findings of the committee. These discussions should take no longer than three months and when completed I will give a definitive response to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the committee's findings is that the <Col N="449" /> number of full-time farmers will decline because of the growth in part-time farming and the higher standards of living people now expect in our rapidly growing economy. The report states:</P>
    <P>Current trends would bring the total number of farms to around 120,000 by 2010. Policy changes, competitive pressures and the increasing &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo; in our rapidly developing economy, are likely to accelerate this process, so that the actual number may be close to 100,000 by the time the effect of these changes is fully felt . . . While it is not possible to be precise about these trends, the Committee believes that these changes are likely to give rise to a situation where we will have around 20,000 full-time farmers, 60,000 part-time farmers, and a transitional group of about 20,000 by approximately 2010.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the number of full-time farmers will continue to fall and the number of part-time farmers will increase as new and attractive job opportunities become available. The Government is fully committed to helping as many farmers and their families as possible to achieve viability and stay on the land, whether they do this through full or part-time farming. It will be vital to maintain and develop the maximum number of highly competitive full-time farmers, and the committee made a number of recommendations in this regard. Part-time farming offers an opportunity to a considerable number of our smaller farmers who would not otherwise be able to create an acceptable standard of living on the land.</P>
    <P>The key issue is that the future of our rural communities should be underpinned by allowing them to share in the benefits of our national economic performance. This will be done by a combination of supporting full-time farming, facilitating part-time farming and ensuring the wide dispersal of jobs in industry and services in rural communities. By doing this we will ensure people from farm families will have the widest possible choice of attractive job opportunities in their local rural areas. We should then support them in whatever they decide is best for themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister welcomed the report which projects a drop from 44,000 to 20,000 in the number of full-time farmers. Does he accept this projection without any word of regret and that it sounds the deathknell for the traditional family farm? Does he accept the projection that most full-time farmers will be involved in milk production and will require a quota of at least 70,000 gallons in ten years' time to survive? Does he accept the general trend of the report and, if so, will he put in place policies to support its findings or does he accept the principles of the founder of his party, as enunciated in the Constitution, that as many full-time farmers as possible should be maintained on the land?</P>

      <P>I established the committee last year to conduct an analysis of the industry. It worked very hard and produced its findings last week. The committee comprised eminent individuals with a good track record in the industry. It is therefore a valuable analysis. As I have said on more than one occasion, I will the study the report and consult with the various parties concerned. When I complete my consultations in about three months I will give my definitive response and outline the policy options in maintaining the maximum number of farmers on the land.</P>

      <P>It may be just an analysis but if the worst predictions outlined in the report were fulfilled, it would mean that the lights in thousands of homes in rural Ireland would go out forever. Does the Minister agree that it would result in the return of rancher style farmers where a small number of people, many of whom would not be Irish, would control large tracts of land? There would also be a return of the type of landlords who existed in the past.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minster's best efforts to facilitate the practice of part-time farming where farmers eke out a living from outside sources, what will happen to those farmers when the Celtic tiger economy collapses as will inevitably happen in five or ten years? Does he agree it is a matter of concern that the projections in the report regarding mixed and beef farmers are particularly grave? What impact will the report, if fulfilled, have on food processing plants? The Minister has done some work with regard to the organic food sector in Wexford, but does he agree there is a need to pursue alternative enterprise, particularly in terms of a move into the emerging market for organic food?</P>

      <P>The report is a sad commentary on what is happening in rural Ireland. It is difficult to know whether they can be precise, but if things are done better in the future than they were in the past and there is a better market for our product, it is entirely possible that the figure will not be as low as 20,000. If it transpires that there are a certain number of part-time farmers, what is the Minister's view on how they should be treated? Will he insist, as he appears to be doing at present, that there must be off-farm income limits which make it as difficult as possible for part-time farmers to get pollution grants, <Col N="451" /> etc? Has the Minister addressed this issue? If not, there will be the worst of all worlds. There will be nobody on the land.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a commitment that he would put policies in place when the study is completed. This is most important. Does he accept it is totally unfair that a young full-time farmer, who has a total of five suckler cows and 100 sheep, is refused an extra suckler quota while a person with a reasonable salary could get ten quotas? If the maximum number of farmers is to be preserved, we must ensure that qualified young farmers have an opportunity to remain in business. Is the Minister aware of how few people want to enter colleges at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Learned people in universities and technical people contributed to this report. They are talking about trends but, as all Deputies are aware, the trend in rural Ireland with regard to farming has been a decline in numbers since the foundation of the State. There is a better opportunity now to retain people in rural communities than ever before. Deputy Connaughton raised the point that in some of the schemes promoted by the EU and the Department there are constraints on people who are part-time farmers. We want to remove those constraints.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Crawford that qualified young people should get every possible chance. Given the availability of modern technology, there is no need to be in the centre of Dublin. The city is suffocating and there is a need for decentralisation. This is why we ensured Coca Cola located in Mayo last year and I hope the company is doing well there. There is a need for the location of many more dot.com companies in villages and towns so people can travel to work and stay in rural communities.</P>
      <P>This study must be considered in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern's White Paper on Rural Development. A total of £6.7 billion underwrites that rural development programme. In addition, local authorities could do more to keep people in rural Ireland. They could be more sympathetic to family members securing planning permission on the family farm and keeping people in rural areas.</P>

Would it be possible to introduce tax breaks such as the section 23 measure or the seaside resorts scheme? There is a need for a good initiative which would encourage young farmers to stay in agriculture. The Minister should not be afraid that other sectors would complain. A fortune has been spent on bringing companies such as Coca Cola to Ireland. They are grant aided to the hilt. The Minister should not be ashamed to look after small and young farmers and people who want to stay in agriculture on a full-time basis to keep rural Ireland alive. He should not be afraid because he would have the support of the House.</P>

      <P>The situation in rural Ireland needs to be taken in hand and there is a need for a considerable injection of money. Thankfully, a considerable sum will go into rural Ireland. For example, a total of £10 billion will be provided in direct payments while a further £4 billion will be provided in Structural Funds. A total of £16 billion or £17 billion will go directly into farming in rural areas up to 2006. Under the national development plan, there will be also indirect infrastructural supports for rural areas. There is a need to address those matters and Government policy is to maintain the maximum number of people in remunerative employment in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Young people are abandoning family farms because they do not wish to milk cows seven mornings and evenings of the week to earn between £7,000 and £8,000 per year when they can earn between £17,000 and £18,000 or £25,000 and £30,000 working for a dot.com company. They say to their parents, &ldquo;I am terribly sorry, I know the farm has been in the family for the past three generations but I have no intention of carrying it on.&rdquo; We must ensure these people can earn a comparable income in their localities and this will help maintain rural communities.</P>
      <P>I asked Teagasc to give special attention to organic production and Warrenstown College is now devoted to this activity. Anyone who visits a supermarket can testify that more shelf space is being devoted to organic produce. However, it is a slow process and it takes time to ensure that development takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion analysis is worthwhile and it indicates trends, but no more than that. Teagasc, UCD, UCC and other reputable institutions contributed to this report which I will study and in <Col N="454" /> respect of which I will consult. My policy will be to ensure the maximum number of people are retained in rural areas.</P>

      <P>The European Commission is finalising the draft guidelines for the Leader+ programme, consequent on the acceptance by the member states of the European Parliament's amendments. It is expected that the finalised guidelines will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission seeking approval to commence the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. Over a number of months, the Commission will subject these programmes to scrutiny to ensure they meet the requisite standard for approval. Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ and the Leader mainstream programme under the national development plan, it is not possible to anticipate the precise arrangements for their delivery or the timing of their introduction. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding for Leader+ will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of the operational programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes. It is clear that the efforts and work done by the local action groups under the Leader I and Leader II programmes has significantly benefited local communities. I acknowledge especially the contribution made by many individuals on a voluntary basis. The earliest commencement of the two new Leader programmes is receiving full attention in my Department.</P>

      <i>Additional Information.</i>Groups have been funded to 30 June 2000 &ndash; the Leader II completion date &ndash; and I am conscious that a further period will elapse before the coming on-stream of the new Leader measures. I was concerned that during this interim period some loss of expertise in rural areas might occur. Accordingly, I have secured interim funding in respect of the period from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 2000 to assist with the administrative costs of existing groups. Such funding will be made available to groups who submit a plan document demonstrating their funding needs in this area. Funding of existing groups will be without prejudice to the selection of groups for the delivery of the new Leader activity.</P>

As a result of the delay in the announcement of the Leader+ scheme and the mainstream programme, is it also not correct that morale in Leader companies is being damaged? I remind the Minister of State that Leader 11 was one of the best and most successful instruments at our disposal to encourage rural development. Will the Minister of State confirm that the Leader programme will not commence until 2001? Will he also confirm that a Leader group could operate a Leader+ scheme and a mainstream scheme?</P>

However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have secured funding from the Government to pay the Leader groups from 30 June to 31 December.

      <QRef>[9642/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from and on behalf of this and other organis<Col N="457" /> ations in regard to the management of milk quotas. I am fully aware of the views of the organisation in question and I have met its representatives on number of occasions. In response to its concerns, which relate largely to the position of quota holders no longer involved in milk production, I have already outlined in detail the options open to its members under the new regime. I have addressed the points raised by the group in the House and officials of my Department have also attended meetings of the joint Oireachtas committee at which the organisation was represented and responded to questions raised by members of the committee.</P>
      <P>The changes which I made to the milk quota regime as set out in SI No. 94 of 2000, which came into effect on 1 April, reflect the Government's concern for the livelihoods of Ireland's dairy farmers and the long-term future of the dairy sector. These changes are necessary if the dairy industry is to successfully position itself to face the competitive challenges which inevitably will arise in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The measures to provide for the transfer of quota other than with land are designed to give more flexibility and certainty to milk producers, greater priority access to quota for small and medium scale producers and more opportunity for competition in the milk production sector. The new milk restructuring scheme will allow for the sale of quota without land in a structured manner and directed towards priority categories. These new arrangements are designed to give active, committed producers greater access to quota over the coming years at a reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>The system of quota transfer linked to land, which existed up to 31 March 2000 meant that producers were often unable to expand their enterprises and realise their full potential because of the uncertainty within the quota system and the limited availability and cost of additional quota. Furthermore, in many cases producers were required to take on additional land which they did not need for their farming operation to acquire extra quota. This imposed an additional cost and made it particularly difficult for small and medium scale producers to acquire quota. The option of temporarily leasing quota existed but this had the disadvantage that it operated only until the end of each quota year and did not give the certainty which active producers needed to plan ahead for the development of their enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concern expressed by those who are no longer involved in milk production and whose quota has been leased into the temporary leasing pool on a continuous basis. I will clarify the position in this regard. It will no longer be possible for such quota holders to temporarily lease their milk quota where the quota has been temporarily leased for the preceding three milk quota years, 1997-1999, or for a longer period. With effect from 1 April 2000, such quota holders will, however, have a number of other options, for example, to resume milk production in their <Col N="458" /> own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year, to sell the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme or to transfer the quota with the holding by way of a family transaction.</P>
    <P>In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply to my Department for an exemption from this provision. In the case of quotas leased out with land, the lessor will also have a number of options when the lease expires on or after 1 April 2000: the quota may be sold to the restructuring scheme; the lease may be renewed; the quota may be sold to the lessee with or without the land by agreement between the lessor and lessee; the quota may be transferred with the holding by way of a family transaction; the quota may be leased into the temporary leasing pool for one year only; the lessor can resume milk production provided he or she is not a participant in the scheme of early retirement from farming; and the lessor can draw up a lease with a new lessee in a case of a participant in the scheme of early retirement from farming where the original lessee is not in a position to renew the lease agreement.</P>
    <P>I have consulted widely and taken extensive legal advice on the new arrangements and I have listened to the different views. The new arrangements are in the best interests of the future development of the industry and those committed to active milk production. All points raised by the group referred to, have been comprehensively and sympathetically dealt with and have been taken into account to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the concerned quota holders' group also includes many people who are not inactive? While many of them are inactive for one reason or another, many are small farmers who do not have access to temporary leasing which they had in the past. Will he accept that the situation in relation to the farm retirement scheme is confused, particularly the position of those involved in the scheme whose leases are now expiring? They are &ldquo;hands in the dog's mouth&rdquo; as far as the current lessees are concerned. Is that not also true in relation to new entrants to the farm retirement scheme?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the scheme has major legal and constitutional implications? It amounts, effectively, to enforced sale of quota at knockdown prices by farmers who might have paid a great deal of money for them in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations have been drawn up following extensive and exhaustive consultations with the office of the Attorney General and the legal services of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The problem for people who were temporarily leasing quota was that annual leasing was unsatisfactory. At the end of a year one did not know if one could re-lease the quota so it was a temporary operation. The future of the industry cannot be built on such foundations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in the farm retirement scheme have a <Col N="459" /> number of options. They can sell the quota into restructuring, renew the lease, sell the quota to the lessee with or without the land, transfer the quota with the holding by way of a family transaction or lease it into the temporary leasing pool for the coming year. The lessor can resume milk production provided he or she is not a participant in the early retirement scheme and the lessor can draw up a lease with a new lessee. If there is a problem with an existing lessee, the person can secure a new lessee and draw up a lease. There are seven options for participants in the farm retirement scheme. It is an extremely fair system.</P>

      <P>Our few remaining farmers are becoming the most bureaucratised group in the world. Did the Minister give any consideration to getting the current temporary leasing, which he correctly described as disastrous for many of the farmers involved, put on a long-term basis of three to five years? I listened to his comments about its implications for the farm retirement scheme. Will he clarify what it means for those in the new REP scheme? How will they fit into it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The three year cap is on the temporary leasing and there will not be a difficulty renewing the lease or selling it to the lessee. If there is a difficulty with the existing lessee, it will be possible to get an alternative lessee.</P>

        <b>:</b> No. 14 should not be agreed without debate. It relates to the agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Russian Federation on co-operation on fighting crime. In view of the appalling record of the Russian Federation on civil rights matters in Chechnya in recent months, under cover of fighting so-called terrorism, there should be a discussion on any co-operation between this State and the Russian Federation. No such agreement should be signed until abuses of civil rights cease forthwith. Will the Tánaiste put the matter back for discussion?</P>

The matter should be discussed in the House and I will continue to raise it until there is a satisfactory explanation. When one contrasts the way the Russians have been treated with how the Austrians have been treated, it is evident that we are not being consistent. It should be discussed. I do not wish to prevent the motion going forward but I am anxious for an explanation of what we are doing about this through this country's chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.

      <P>Thank you, Sir, for clarifying that. <Col N="465" /> I was probably in order to ask about secondary legislation on the Groceries Order, 1987. Will the Tánaiste tell the House if she intends to abolish or retain the order, which all the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business endorse, including the Members behind her? I hope the Tánaiste will listen to that committee and to small grocers throughout the country and retain the groceries order, which is secondary legislation.</P>

A number of concerns are involved &ndash; those of consumers, of competition in the economy, and of small suppliers who tend to get a raw deal from large multiples. All these concerns must be taken into account. The mergers and review group established by my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, three and a half years ago has now reported. I had hoped to have the report published by now but there was a major logistical delay. Nonetheless, I hope to have it published quickly. We should then reflect on what it says.

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the last occasion that, in some urban areas, joyriding, drug and alcohol abuse, vandalism, the torturing of animals, the stoning of Garda cars and fire brigades are very common. There is poor community leadership and many dysfunctional families in some areas. This Bill tries to deal with those problems and that asks a lot. Things are improving. The partnerships to tackle long-term unemployment, the drug task forces, the community Garda scheme and more lottery funding and resources for voluntary, community and sporting organisations are having an impact. This Bill will also have an impact. I hope it is implemented speedily and backed up with adequate resources.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill allowing for a family welfare conference. Requests for a care order, a supervision order or a special care order can also be considered. Such orders are significant and far-reaching but they should only be used in exceptional circumstances. Parents are the best people to rear their children and to protect their welfare. However, I recognise that in some cases such orders are necessary in the interest of the child and in the overall interest of society.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be applauded for raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12. When this Bill is passed, children under 12 will not be considered to have committed a crime. It was appalling that up to now a child between the ages of seven and 12 paid for a once-off incident in childhood for the rest of his or her adult life by having a criminal record. Intervention by the health board in such cases is preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the media interest in the 1996 Bill concerned the issue of parents paying for the crimes of their children. However, such media concern was narrowly focused at the time. Nevertheless, parental responsibility is an important concept. In this Bill parents can be bound over to exercise proper and adequate control over their child. The court can also make a parental supervision order <Col N="470" /> and parents can be ordered to pay compensation. This is a popular idea. The question is often asked if parents should be made financially liable for the misdeeds of their children. The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if it is feasible and appropriate in the case. There are good and bad parents, regardless of social circumstances and the courts must get involved in the case of bad parents.</P>
    <P>This raises the issue of parenting skills. With the breakdown of the extended family and the reduction in family size, many parents are not trained to rear children. Some churches insist on pre-marriage guidance courses. However, rearing children is the last thing on the mind of any young couple getting married. We must encourage parenting skills. Existing grant schemes could be further expanded to ensure adequate parenting skills for those who need them most.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis. This provides for a family conference which in practice will be convened by a juvenile liaison officer or a community garda. An action plan can be put in place following such a family conference and the victim can also attend. I welcome the emphasis on the victim. The victim is being given a status for the first time and will be involved in the process through the family conference. The Minister has struck the right balance between a person who has committed an offence or been involved in an incident and the victim who often wants to become involved for various reasons. No one would disagree with the philosophy of this Bill that children do not belong in courts or prisons.</P>
    <P>There are serious problems in many areas of this city and in urban centres throughout the country. Tonight on Private Members' business we will discuss joyriding. This issue needs to be addressed in a comprehensive way. I have seen drug and alcohol abuse, vandalism and the brutal torture of horses, donkeys, dogs and other animals in many areas of this city. We must target the children involved in such activities.</P>
    <P>The partnerships to tackle long-term unemployment have been a welcome development. They have helped to set up community support structures and to target those most at risk. We must continue to encourage them in their work. Huge resources are being targeted at special areas to provide alternatives for young people. New activities are being created and new facilities, such as treatment centres, are being provided in areas which need them. The drug task forces are co-ordinating these activities in an effort to deal with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>Many communities have sporting organisations organised by volunteers. As a society, we are indebted to these people who organise sporting activities, such as football and boxing matches, every day and every weekend without reward. They are the salt of the earth because they provide an invaluable service to our young people. We are all better off as a result of such activities. That is why lottery funding for such organisations is extremely important. I welcome the fact that <Col N="471" /> many activities come under the umbrella of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I also welcome the fact that lottery funding is targeted at small organisations which do invaluable work in keeping our young people out of prison.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. People's quality of life will improve if the mechanisms outlined in the Bill help to deal with children at a vulnerable age. No one could disagree that children do not belong in courts or prisons. I also welcome the fact that adequate resources have been promised by the Minister to back up all the Bill's provisions, particularly those relating to the activities of health boards, child and social workers and so on. We will have done a good day's work when this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation. The main purpose of the Bill is to replace the remaining provisions of the Children Act, 1908, which has remained on the Statute Book for 92 years. The Bill has three main objectives: it provides the framework for the development of a juvenile justice system, it re-enacts and updates the provisions in the 1908 Act protecting children against persons who have custody, charge or care of them and it provides for a family welfare conference and other new provisions for dealing with out of control and non-offending children.</P>
      <P>Children inevitably suffer when their parents decide to live apart. The continued absence of one parent is a major source of anguish in a child's life which can be exacerbated by the competition between parents caused by custody and other access inequalities. Sole custody is the most frequent outcome when parents separate whereby children spend the majority of their time with one parent. The parent who gets sole physical custody effectively gains control of the children and commands a strong position in negotiations with the non-custodial parent for the relationship with the family.</P>
      <P>Shared parenting has been highly successful in other western countries over the past two decades. It has been shown to improve the welfare of children, reduce arguing between parents and improve the cohesion of the two parent family unit. Children would do better if they were able to maintain an ongoing relationship with both parents, unless violence and abuse are involved.</P>
      <P>In recognising the importance of putting children's needs first, a growing number of countries are looking towards shared parenting as a legal objective so that children caught up in a change of family circumstance are not deprived of either parent. Shared parenting is based on the notion that if divorce or separation is inevitable, both parents should be able to continue to share in the parenting of the children. We should put procedures in place which would provide children with frequent and continuing access to both parents. This is a difficult and sensitive issue which should be properly addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a significant problem with children <Col N="472" /> who lose contact with a parent when couples separate. It is a tragedy that present legislation pits one parent against the other when a marriage breaks down. Inevitably one parent is the winner and gains custody of the children while the other parent is the loser and becomes nothing more than a visitor in their child's life.</P>
    <P>Shared parenting would prevent the tragedy of children walking into the family court with two parents and walking out with only one. Every year thousands of innocent children end up with only one parent due to separation and divorce. This is due in no small part to the anger and hostility the system causes, supports and encourages between divorcing couples. By the time people have finished with the incredible ordeal of litigation they cannot possibly function as parents. Mutual love and respect are turned into conflict and resentment, placing a strain on the once mutual commitment to ensuring that the needs and interests of the children were put before those of the parents. Everyone loses as a result of court proceedings. The biggest losers are children who must go through life with one parent. This is not acceptable and we must address this problem. We need a new initiative to save children and families from such situations even though family courts can be very sensitive to the needs of children. We should examine this situation.</P>
    <P>We need to advance the education of the public, politicians, teachers, members of the medical and legal professions, social workers and mediators by heightening public awareness of the area of child care, parenting and the importance of the full and active involvement of both parents and extended families in the rearing of children. We also need to support all parents by seeking to equally involve mothers and fathers in the shared parenting of their children within relationships and marriage and through the promotion of joint custody as the norm in cases of separation and relationship breakdown.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to establish the equality and dignity of mothers and fathers in the parenting of children and to promote and emphasise the importance of mothers and fathers as parents, guardians, carers and custodians of their children. The State must reflect this position in every aspect of parental and child legislation.</P>
    <P>The welfare of children should be of paramount consideration at all times. It is important to promote shared responsibility in parenting, both within and outside marriage, and to bring about the expectation that, in the event of marital breakdown, joint custody and continued shared parenting are considered the norm. We also need to promote research and continued education on the effects on children and parents of shared parenting. We must also increase public awareness of shared parenting through education and highlight the interchangeable role played by mothers and fathers. In addition, it is important to remain totally impartial and non-judgmental in situations of broken relationships.</P>
    <P>We must highlight the damaging effects of the <Col N="473" /> adversarial family law court system on parents, children and extended families in terms of future animosity and mutual mistrust. Instead we must promote the increased involvement of trained personnel with appropriate educational, psychological, social and negotiating skills to build a consensus towards agreed solutions in the event of the breakdown of relationships. This is particularly important given the changing nature of society.</P>
    <P>We must also highlight the need for education and regular in-service training to update the skills in family law matters and social behaviour trends. Funds should be made available towards education and back-up support for members of the public and State services to enable the group to function and pursue its objectives. It will also be necessary to promote parenting courses to educate mothers and fathers in the concept of shared parenting.</P>
    <P>There is a need to implement a divorced parent and child education programme to help reduce the anger, hostility and anxiety caused by separation, particularly in cases of divorce, and the dramatic changes in the lives of parents and children. The main focus of such a programme should be to help parents diffuse their anger and hostility towards each other and to put aside their differences to enable the children to cope with the trauma and changes brought about by separation and divorce.</P>
    <P>We must also encourage all agencies involved to adopt the mandatory educational programme and a system of mediation, conciliation and arbitration which would replace the current adversarial system of dispute resolution. The current system has been found to do nothing but heighten and exacerbate parent anger and hostility rather than reduce or diffuse it. The end product of anger is the intense hurt and needless suffering of children which could be easily avoided by a new system.</P>
    <P>Article 42 of the Constitution acknowledges that the primary natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees respect for the inalienable right and duty of the parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children. This is an inescapable duty for each parent. The article, without equivocation, guarantees that the State will respect that right and duty. All parents have the right to expect that the Government will facilitate them in a pro-active, substantial and respectful manner in fulfilling this inalienable constitutional obligation to their children.</P>
    <P>A first step in such facilitation would be to create a new concept of fairness and acceptability by using the phrase "shared parenting" in cases of separation and divorce and eliminating the words &ldquo;custody&rdquo; and &ldquo;access to children&rdquo;. Children need more than emotional support, they need financial support. That is what shared parenting means &ndash; shared emotional and financial support. Financially, both parents have an equal duty to <Col N="474" /> provide whatever support they can based on the ultimate best interests of the children. If one parent cannot work, the other parent must carry the load. If both parents work, they both must share the load, just as they did before they decided to separate. Both are involved in their children's lives and must put aside their own interests to provide everything they can for their children. A minimum standard should be set.</P>
    <P>Family welfare conferences, as provided for in this Bill, are an important mechanism for early intervention when children are at risk. Section 7 establishes the circumstances in which a family welfare group conference may be convened. The health board will convene such a conference and chair it. Section 8 sets out the functions of that conference. It can decide if a child needs special care or protection and may make recommendations to the health board on the care and protection of the child. Section 13 sets out how the health board can give effect to the recommendations of the family welfare conference. It can apply for a special care order, which is important in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with children in need of special care or protection. It amends the Child Care Act, 1991, by inserting new provisions for additional powers for health boards to ensure that non-offending children who are out of control receive special care, education and treatment. Also, the age limit for such treatment has been increased from seven years to 12 years.</P>
    <P>Section 23(<i>c</i>) enables a court to make an internal special care order where there is reason to believe grounds exist for making such an order and that it is in the interests of a child that he or she be detained in a special care unit. The application can be made notwithstanding the fact that a family welfare conference is being arranged or an application for a special care order is based on it. Section 23(<i>f</i>) provides for the variation or discharge of a special care order by the court on its own motion following a person's application.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals comprehensively with many issues. It updates legislation which has existed since 1901. Schools and community groups must be able to support children. Recreational facilities must be funded. Interaction with the community is vital for young children and teenagers. Involvement with sport is of great importance. I salute teachers and parents who show such dedication in athletics, football and other sports.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of resource groups which identify the needs of communities. There are often few playground facilities in large housing estates but now there is a growing awareness of the need for funding for such facilities. A major difficulty for children in the seven to 12 year old group is that they have nothing to do. For years community leaders did all of the work. The objective now is to get parents involved in the supervision of their children.</P>
    <P>The court system can cause trauma for both children and parents, although family courts play a vital role. Increasing the powers of health <Col N="475" /> boards in child care, and integrating those powers with those of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in child care are welcome innovations.</P>
    <P>Investment in children, through community sports grants or grants for amenities, is money well spent. Lottery funding has been well targeted in this area. Schools also must be given adequate funding for sports facilities. There is a huge amount of money available now that was not previously available and we must invest it in the protection and education of children. The aspects I dealt with may be provided for in the Bill at a later Stage. Joint parenting will be an important issue in the future. The position that prevails when one parent gets custody of the children and the other parent is restricted to seeing the children for only an hour or two a week cannot be good for any member of the family. We have legislated for separation and divorce and it would be good if family feuds surrounding such issues could be avoided.</P>
    <P>We must ensure children do not suffer as a result of new relationships that develop. I know of one case where a father can visit his three year old son for only an hour and a half a week and the child's mother leaves when he arrives. While the situation is difficult, the arrangements are unsatisfactory for the father and the situation is disturbing for the son. If couples decide to separate, it would be good if such hostility could be avoided. It is regrettable that children suffer in such cases. While it is difficult to introduce legislation to address these problems, funds could be made available in the interests of children to provide for an agreement on joint parenting to enable both parents to spend equal time with their children, if that is what each parent wishes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I compliment Deputy Neville who has worked extensively on it since he was elected to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish people, as is the case in most countries, cherish the role of children in society. It is incumbent on parents and guardians right through to Government agencies to ensure that children receive all the opportunities possible to ensure they can participate in society actively and with enjoyment.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to fundamentally amend the Children Act, 1908. It is long overdue. It must be supported because it introduces many innovative provisions to develop our modern juvenile justice system.</P>
      <P>It introduces creative solutions and options to help young people who are in trouble. While any system for dealing with young offenders must retain the ultimate sanction of incarceration, the provisions of this Bill start from the premise that this option should be brought into play only when a range of what are essentially community based measures have been exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government to guaran<Col N="476" /> tee that all measures possible to divert young people away from a life of crime are introduced. A clear philosophy underpins the Bill. It provides a framework that will prevent offending by young people and, where offending has taken place, will prevent further offending.</P>
    <P>In formulating the position on which the Bill is based, we have had to strike a fair balance between the needs and interests of the child offender with the protection of the community and what is generally good for society.</P>
    <P>The new powers that will be given to the courts and the array of new community sanctions that will be available to them are designed for rehabilitation purposes in a non-custodial environment. Detention will be a last resort, but where it is essential the emphasis will be on the successful reintegration of the child offender into society.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that the Government is facing up to its responsibility in this. It is well recognised that there has been widespread co-operation between key Government Departments and State agencies in devising this legislation. The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science were centrally involved in drafting these provisions.</P>
    <P>Part 2 deals with the mechanism to set up family welfare conferences. This will provide a mechanism for early intervention at an inter-agency level for children at risk. The conference can be triggered in two ways, on the direction of the court where it considers that a child before it on a criminal charge may be in need of special care or protection, or where it appears to a health board that a child in its area may require special care or protection.</P>
    <P>Section 8 states that the family welfare conference can decide if a child is in need of special care or protection and it can make recommendations to the health board relating to the care and protection of the child. Attendance at this conference will be by the child, the parents or guardian of the child or the relatives of the child where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The health boards will have responsibility to provide the necessary administrative services for holding family conferences. They will have the power to give effect to the recommendations of a family welfare conference. Essentially, they can apply for a special care order or any other order, where appropriate, under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with the future administration of the Garda diversion programme. The primary purpose of this provision is to place the Garda diversion programme on a statutory footing. At present, it operates on an administrative level only. A unique feature of this diversion programme will be the introduction of restorative cautioning. This will be a type of mini conference which may apply in cases where a full Garda convened conference is not warranted. It means that where a formal caution is being administered to a child offender who has been admitted to the <Col N="477" /> diversion programme, the victim may be present. This will provide an opportunity to confront the child with the consequences of his or her offending in the presence of the victim and for the child to be invited to offer an apology or make reparation to the victim. As a matter of policy, the intention is that as many children as possible who commit offences will be admitted to the diversion programme.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with the administration of a caution, whether informal or formal. An informal caution can be administered where no previous caution has been administered or where any previous caution or cautions have also been informal.</P>
    <P>Section 29 establishes that a convened conference may be held in respect of a child who has been formally cautioned and is being supervised by a juvenile officer. This is an integral part of the diversion programme. It also sets out the functions of the conference. The conference will have a wide remit to examine the child's problems, reasons for offending, etc., and will be able to discuss how, through family support and community involvement, the child might be diverted from crime. Attendance at the conference will consist of the child, his or her parents or guardian and or other members of the child's family and the facilitator who may be a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The conference will also be able to formulate an action plan for the child. This plan may provide for such things as an apology and reparation to the victim, participation by the child in appropriate sporting and recreational activities, attendance at school or work or participation in other training or educational courses that do not interfere with school or work.</P>
    <P>Part 5 deals with the issue of criminal responsibility. Section 52 raises the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years. This section also states that there is a rebuttable presumption that a child between the age of responsibility and 14 years is incapable of committing an offence by reason of the fact that the child did not have the capacity to know that the act or omission was wrong. The age of 12 will mean that our age of criminal responsibility will be one of the highest in common law jurisdictions. That is the age recommended in the first report of the former Dáil Select Committee on Crime. The UN committee on the rights of the child had, in fact, criticised our age limit in the context of the proposal to raise it to ten years in the 1996 Children Bill. This provision, by way of raising the age or criminal responsibility to 12, will address these criticisms.</P>
    <P>Part 9 deals with the powers of courts in relation to child offenders. In most cases, the court will be obliged to request a probation officer's report. The courts will also have the power to request any other report they consider appropriate in addition to the probation officer's report. Any fines the courts impose on children can only be half that imposed on adults. The <Col N="478" /> court must have regard to the ability of the child to pay such a fine.</P>
    <P>Sections 111 and 112 give the courts the power to make a parental supervision order. This can be imposed where the court is satisfied that a wilful failure on the part of the parents of a child before the court to take care of or control the child contributed towards the behaviour which resulted in the child being found guilty of an offence. The effect of the order can include obliging the parents to undergo treatment for alcohol or other substance abuse or to participate in a parenting skills training course. The courts will also have power to order the parent or guardian of a child offender to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper or adequate control over the child.</P>
    <P>The court is empowered to refer the child to a health board where it considers that the child's real problem is the need of care and protection, in other words, the offending, usually like petty larceny, may be a cry for help. The health board will investigate the child's circumstances and report back to court. Where the court proceeds to a finding, and that finding is one of guilt, it will have many new options at its disposal when deciding how best to deal with the child. These options are essential features of the Bill as they allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a matter of last resort. For instance, there will be a choice of ten community sanctions, two of which are already in existence. These, along with the eight new sanctions, should ensure an appropriate and suitable community sanction will be available for each child on whom such a sanction is imposed. These community sanctions include the following &ndash; probation order, community service order, day centre order, training or activities order, intensive supervision order, residential supervision order, suitable person order, mentor order, restriction on movement order and dual order.</P>
    <P>There is one important new change to the child protection provision which needs to be highlighted. The offence of cruelty to children has been updated and the penalty substantially raised. Effect is being given to a recommendation of the report of the Select Committee on Social Affairs on non-fatal offences against the person in respect of children so as to expand the meaning of cruelty. In future, such cruelty will include mental and emotional cruelty as well as physical cruelty.</P>
    <P>Provision is included in the Bill for the setting up of a special residential services board to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children on whom children detention orders have been imposed or in respect of whom special care orders have been made. This will entail a provision for the deletion of a provision in the 1996 Bill for a single board of management to manage all the children detention schools. Statutory boards of management will be appointed to each children detention school or group of schools and some of the functions earmarked for the board proposed in the original <Col N="479" /> 1996 Bill will be assumed by the special residential services board.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Children Bill provides an exceptional opportunity to turn young people away from crime. This is a Bill that is premised on introducing a system based on restorative justice. The advantages of restorative justice are well documented. If successful, there will be no finding of guilt, with all that entails. The child offender and his or her family will be involved in arriving at an equitable solution and the offender will be made aware of the effects of his or her criminal behaviour on the victim and will possibly have to do so in the presence of the victim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to pose a few questions to the Minister. Following the enactment of the Bill, will children be any better off or will it just mean more rules and regulations which will not be implemented? The complaint of many organisations is that legislation is passed in this House but the funding or staffing is not made available to implement it. There is not much point enacting legislation if we do not put the resources in place to implement it. I pose another question to the Minister. Are children better off now than they were 30 years ago? I believe not because there are more pressures on children nowadays. If one travels throughout the country, one does not see children out playing or enjoying themselves anymore. However, if one goes into any household or bar at this time of the evening, one will see children watching television. Would we not be better off introducing legislation to control some of the filth and dirt on television at any hour of the day? Children get up at 7 o'clock in the morning, switch on the television and they do not turn it off until five minutes before their parents bring them to school. If children come home for their lunch, they put on the television and they switch it on when they arrive home at 4 p.m. This is not a good influence on children. Perhaps we should consider the violence on television up until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. when children are watching. Some of the soap operas from Australia and other countries are not suitable for young children, yet they are not monitored. RTE will say it does the best it can and that it must compete with the BBC, Sky television and so on. I do not think we have progressed in the past 20 or 30 years. Will children be better off following the enactment of the Bill?</P>
      <P>I am annoyed that more children are disadvantaged and are begging on the streets. If we, as legislators, did our job correctly that would not happen. It is sad that any child has to beg and that children have to work out of necessity. We have only to listen to the PR people, commentators and the media to hear how well this country is doing. People are ashamed to say they are not doing so well and that they are unable to live on low wages or on social welfare. Some children go to school hungry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the budget speech each year the Mini<Col N="480" /> ster for Finance announces an increase in child benefit for the first and second child and a greater increase for the third and subsequent children. There should not be discrimination in the social welfare code. All children should be treated equally and the higher rate should be paid to all children. Will the Minister do something about that in consultation with the Government?</P>
    <P>As one who holds clinics on a regular basis it upsets me to see parents who cannot live, manage or control their children. Recently a woman on social welfare came into my clinic. Her child who was in sixth class could neither read nor write. She had to pay to have her child assessed. It was discovered that the child is dyslexic. How is it that a child can go through the education system from first to sixth classes and yet can neither read nor write? Why had a parent on social welfare to pay to have the child assessed? I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Education and Science asking what he would do for that child who is about to start secondary school and cannot read or write. Parents on low incomes cannot pay for grinds. I am not criticising the teaching profession. However, if we, as legislators, did our job correctly we would not be discussing this Bill but various Acts and systems to ensure no child would leave the education system without being able to read or write and that parents on social welfare would not have to pay to have their child assessed. Two or three years down the road what benefit will this Bill be to that child, parent or family? The second child in that family has a similar problem. The mother also had the same problem. What will the education system do for those children?</P>
    <P>I have listened on many occasions to people who say we must love, protect and look after our children. Yet parents ask politicians why their child has to wait four, and sometimes five, years for orthodontic treatment. One may ask what this has got to do with the Bill. However, a self-conscious child with a teeth problem may be made fun of or taken advantage of at school. Children can be cruel. What will the Bill do for these children? What will it do for the family that was told there was a two-year waiting list, a few months later they are told the waiting list was two-and-a-half years and last week they were told it was three-and-a-half years? I ask the Government what will happen to the families waiting for that service? What will the Bill do for the disadvantaged child? What will it do for the child who hates getting up and going to school because she knows when she enters the school yard somebody will make fun of her because she has prominent teeth? That is the single most important issue for that child and her family. The parents on social welfare cannot afford to get the treatment from the private sector.</P>
    <P>The guidelines on the clothing and footwear scheme state each year that the scheme is to benefit parents and children, yet every regulation and obstacle that can be put in place by the health board is put in place. If some people are on social <Col N="481" /> welfare and on a FÁS scheme they do not qualify. That is not helping the children. If people have these problems where should they go to have them redressed? I am upset that this happens and that children suffer due to insufficient resources coming into the house.</P>
    <P>There should be greater emphasis on children's health because it is a serious issue. In this Celtic tiger economy many young parents starting off find it difficult to control their children because they expect so much. That well-off children come to school in different outfits every day puts pressure on less well off parents. I had a case of a husband and wife, both working in a factory, taking home £230 per week. They have two children and are not eligible for a medical card. The two children have asthma. They hear local and national politicians in the Dáil and on local radio before elections say what they will do for families and children. Yet this family with two asthmatic children does not qualify for the health board scheme whereby one can claim a certain sum each month. Many parents cannot afford to take their children to a doctor. When children get asthmatic attacks parents hope it will pass off and that nothing will happen them. Where in the Bill is that matter dealt with? Will parents who have a genuine case and genuine sickness in the house be catered for in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I could continue to speak about promises given by Governments in relation to children. If the Government and all political parties were serious, children up to 14 years of age, irrespective of means, would have medical cards. If one parent is working and getting some form of social welfare, they should be eligible for a medical card for children.</P>
    <P>What can be done to help disadvantaged children on the street and those who commit crime? Bringing them before the courts and sending them to jail is not the answer. The best thing we can do is provide them with an education. What is being done about children in the education system whose disadvantage is not identified? How can this be dealt with? How can we deal with those on low incomes who have nobody to speak for them? How can we ensure that every child's progress in the education system is assessed? A recent study found that 165,000 children in the country have learning difficulties. If these children were identified and helped in good time, these difficulties would not develop. Young people who are educationally disadvantaged are often drawn to a life of crime in order to get money. This causes many problems for families who cannot deal with such young people. Where do we go from here? Will the children of the country be better off as a result of this Bill or is this simply legislation from which no action will follow?</P>
    <P>I have received many complaints from constituents regarding difficult children. This problem is a difficult one for the health boards, the Garda Síochána and other authorities. Gardaí and health board officials are often afraid to act for <Col N="482" /> fear of being sued. Extra powers for dealing with children should be given to gardaí and health board workers so that they are not slow to move. It is right that gardaí should be slow to bring children to court but action in the early stages can prevent children coming to court. It should be possible for the authorities to assess a home situation before a young person falls foul of the law.</P>
    <P>More resources are needed. There is a shortage of social workers. When one makes a representation to a health board one is often told that personnel are not available to deal with the problem. Public representatives are told to go back to Government and get more resources. Health boards should be given increased powers to assess and monitor situations so that children with difficulties do not come to court unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>It saddens me to see the condition of children in the new millennium. Are children better off now than they were 30 years ago? They are not because they are no happier. There are great social and economic pressures on families. Frequently both parents are obliged to work and children do not receive the care and love they need. As politicians we find it difficult to spend time with our own families and later in life we may regret not giving our children more time.</P>
    <P>The weak and disadvantaged must be looked after. It should be our objective that no child will be seen begging on the streets in the future. Such children and their families must be given a comfortable home and access to educational resources. The people of Ireland do not want more tax breaks. They have a social conscience and wish to see more resources being put into education and into helping the disadvantaged, particularly disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>We have seen how vulnerable children were abused in the past by people who were supposed to be looking after them. I hope those days are gone, that children are protected and that people who are entrusted with the care of children will not betray that trust. Nevertheless, when ones sees childen roaming the streets one wonders if things have improved since those days.</P>
    <P>We do not do enough for disadvantaged children. Simple actions could be taken to help mothers and fathers to rear their children. I would like to see the Government challenging the power of television. I would like to see children playing football on an evening such as this rather than watching &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; or &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo;. Children who know all the characters in these television programmes would not know the name of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They know who is playing for Manchester United but they do not know what is happening in their schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I have an interest and some expertise in this area but there is a danger that I may try to say everything and say nothing at the same time. I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill and I have spoken within our party <Col N="483" /> on the need for legislation of this kind. I spent 30 years teaching and a large part of my life outside school working in youth clubs. I have also served on the boards of Trinity House and similar places so my comments are informed by that experience.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken account of important principles in the context of the body of legislation which has emanated from this and previous Governments. The Child Care Act, 1991, was a seminal piece of legislation, the Education Act has made significant advances in restructuring education and the Education (Welfare) Bill which is before the Select Committee on Education and Science is also an important provision. This Bill is acutely important. It puts children at the centre. Even the famous Children Act, 1908, with all its faults, bore in mind the importance of the child. It says much for its value that the 1908 Act has stood the test of time. It had its faults and it was modified and reinterpreted until it was substantially replaced by the Child Care Act, 1991. I am glad to see that this Bill contains provisions to update the legislation so that the 1908 Children Act will become part of history.</P>
      <P>It is proposed in Part 4 of the Bill to set up a crime diversion programme on a statutory basis. I remember when gardaí gave their free time to youth clubs and other activities and did what is now professionally called crime diversion. When I came to work in Finglas in the 1960s, Inspector O'Meara was involved in building a youth club where a range of activities was provided for young people who were in danger of being on the wrong side of the law. Activities such as woodwork, physical education and swimming were provided. Tom Casey was the first official juvenile liaison officer in the Garda Síochána and worked in the inner city of Dublin. He was a big, strong, burly policeman but a very kindly man who was very interested in young people. He provided night tours of Dublin. All of us who were involved in youth clubs at that time availed of his night tours. We were taken to RTE, Tara Street fire station, the meteorological office, the casualty department of St. Vincent's Hospital and so on. He organised a very good programme. A huge amount of very good voluntary work was and is being done by gardaí. The appointment of community gardaí in recent times has led to greater interaction with the local community. Some of them are well cut out for this work; others are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now proposed to place the programme on a statutory basis. There are a number of very good projects throughout the city, including Ronanstown in Clondalkin, Cherry Orchard, Blanchardstown and Finglas, all of which are closely knitted to the youth service. They represent positive alternatives and devote much time to activities such as horsemanship, personal development, motorbikes and cars. While I support everything in Part 4 of the Bill, I have reservations about placing every aspect of the programme on a statutory basis. The danger is that services will be pro<Col N="484" /> vided only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday with few services available at weekends.</P>
    <P>Conferences will be convened by a member of the Garda Síochána and reports submitted to the director who shall be a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent. This will give the programme status. I am anxious that the Minister takes steps by way of regulation or amendment to ensure other community services are seen as part of this provision.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister sincerely for giving victims an opportunity to confront the young person who has hurt them in some way, in many cases severely. Last Friday afternoon in my constituency a gang of marauding youths ranging in age from ten to 20 years, who were drunk out of their minds from about 4 p.m., rammed the gates of a lovely neighbourhood park in three cars, two of which were stolen &ndash; the other was a company car owned by a member of the gang &ndash; and mowed down 25 to 30 trees planted by Dublin Corporation. They burned the cars several hours later, having terrorised the local community, some of whom did not get to bed until 5 a.m.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the young people who engage in such activity are in the minority but they are increasingly becoming a vicious minority and need to be confronted. The conferences to be organised under the programme will need to be well structured and provide for the attendance of victims. Often an entire area is brought down by the offences of the young people concerned who will have to be prepared to involve themselves in restitution and reparation. The youths to whom I referred should be made replant the trees, paint over the graffiti and rehang the gates. Those who work should be made pay for their misdeeds. This is provided for in the Bill. What does one say to children as young as eight, nine and ten years caught in the slipstream of this misbehaviour?</P>
    <P>There is a need for an integrated approach to the delivery of services. On Saturday afternoon, just before the rugby match started, in the park to which I referred six to eight of my past pupils walked past me, one of whom is at serious risk. I doubt if she has left sixth class yet. Whatever we do, there is a need to ensure the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform deliver a programme together. I am concerned at the variety of professionals involved, from juvenile liaison officers who are doing exceptionally good work, to home-school-community liaison teachers and social workers, all of whom are dealing with different aspects of a young person's life. Only rarely do they manage to come together to co-ordinate a programme. The Bill holds out this possibility, whether through family welfare conferences or case conferences under the diversion programme.</P>
    <P>The juvenile liaison officer scheme needs to be expanded. The gardaí concerned are visionary and continue to do pioneering work in a small number of disadvantaged areas. If the necessary support services are to be provided we will have <Col N="485" /> to bite the bullet and resource the appointment of many more juvenile liaison officers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the raising of the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years. Everybody agrees that this is the way forward. I am glad it is being done in one go rather than by way of regulation as envisaged by the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with the sanctions to be applied to children on reaching court. Judges of the Children's Court have had a great deal of success in working with the Garda Síochána and teachers in keeping young people out of prison. I do not agree with those who say we are more inclined than ever to put young people in prison. The majority of judges of the Children's Court are very enlightened. I think in particular of former judges O'Sullivan and Kennedy who lent their support to families in suburban areas by attending baptisms, weddings and funerals. They were real friends of families at risk, of which there are many. I am glad the sanctions envisaged are community based.</P>
    <P>Under sections 108 to 110 the courts will have the power to impose fines on children. While this will not be done lightly, it has to be done. In many instances we are talking about 15 and 16 year olds, many of whom have incomes of their own.</P>
    <P>In what I have to say on parental responsibility I am in a minority of one, even within my own party. The sanctions which apply to parents when children are allowed to run riot ought to include the payment of a fine by way of deductions at source, even where they are in receipt of social welfare income. The Bill states that cognisance will be taken of the ability of parents to pay. Unfortunately a minority of parents will get the money to pay the fine from the community welfare officer rather than paying it themselves. The sanction must hurt and, for some, that will happen only when it hurts their pockets.</P>
    <P>Many support programmes for parents who have difficulty organising their lives are run by the health boards and in schools. Speaking from my experience as a teacher, in many cases those who avail of them do not need to do so. I am glad there is a mechanism in the Bill whereby a parental supervision order can be introduced. As I understand it, a parent can be sent on a variety of programmes, a course on budgeting, home management, addiction counselling, etc. I welcome that. Sections 133 to 136 deal with restriction on movement orders for child offenders. I call that a curfew. A small number of youngsters will have to be contained in their homes, by order. Certain courts in Dublin apply such orders with some success. Under the Bill the restriction order will apply from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. However, it should apply from 5 p.m., particularly in winter time, until later in the morning.</P>
    <P>Sections 118 to 123 deal with day centres. As the Minister knows, one of these is envisaged for my constituency under the aegis of the probation and welfare service. I welcome that and the reassurances and guidelines given in regard to its <Col N="486" /> operation. Young people need to be treated in their own community. In the case of day centres they will be collected from their homes and will pursue a structured programme. They will be guided, counselled and given an educational opportunity. Hopefully they will progress into further education or training and employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 259 which provides for a "clean slate". It is long past time this was adopted. The Minister is to be praised for introducing it. A former pupil, now in his thirties, at the age of 14 had the misfortune to foolishly buy a pair of runners at his door. He was brought to the Garda station and the offence was put on his record. He was unable to apply for a PSB licence in another local authority as a result.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. There is a great programme of development in residential centres. I compliment the management and staff in St. Laurence's and St. Michael's in Finglas on the work they are doing, particularly in getting young people to the stage of independent living. There is an exciting experiment being conducted there and long may it continue. The Bill contains many important wide-ranging provisions. It will change the justice system as it applies to children and will reassure local communities who may feel there is no way out for them regarding young people who may be vicious. I would like to see services for young people integrated and the various Departments working more closely together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will be a relief to those who read media reports of the comments made by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly regarding the problem of finding a suitable place of detention for a 17 year old girl. We felt his frustration that there was nowhere for this girl to go, the State had let her down. There are many such cases. We hear a constant plea from the Judiciary to the State to do something about these children who are out of control and a danger to themselves and others.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of the Bill are refreshing. It is a modern approach that will complement the Childcare Act, 1991. It has three main aspirations, developing the juvenile justice system, updating the provisions of the 1908 Act and providing for family welfare conferences to deal with children who are out of control and are non-offenders. Society has undergone many changes since 1908 and it is high time legislation was updated. However, from listening to media comment and speaking to people who work in the field I have reservations about these aspirations. Will the necessary resources be made available? There is need for regulations and guidelines. There must be a change in the attitude of officials who work with children and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need to look at the extra demands that will be placed on already overstretched services such as the health boards, Garda and juvenile liaison services. There seems to be an onus on these agencies to intervene at an earlier stage in the development of the offending child profile, thus <Col N="487" /> placing an extra strain and burden on their resources. The Minister must secure the necessary financial resources to ensure full implementation of the Bill. We should implement existing legislation to meet current needs before establishing a series of new legislative requirements.</P>
    <P>The Childcare Act, 1991 failed to make a full impact due to lack of resources. It was successful in putting in place a management system that ensured all the "t's" were crossed and the "i's" dotted but it failed children because of the lack of social workers, psychologists and foster parents. From speaking to those who work in the field, the difficulty experienced by health boards in acquiring foster parents will prove an obstacle to the successful implementation of this Bill. Many instances of child sexual abuse were validated but in the majority of cases the relevant health boards were unable to offer immediate or even short-term counselling or support because of a lack of resources. There is a need to channel available resources into validation as directed by the Act. The Childcare Act also gave the Garda and the health boards new authority to intervene in cases where children were at risk. However, limited extra resources were made available for the provision of specialist residential centres or fostering arrangements for these children. Frequently, children end up being returned to the abusive environment or less than ideal care arrangements.</P>
    <P>Family welfare conferences will be an important aspect of the legislation. A health board will have the authority to call such conferences either by direct order of the court or because it believes a child who resides in the area may require special care or protection which the child is unlikely to receive unless the court makes such an order.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill that deals with privilege states that no evidence shall be admissible in court regarding any information, statement or admission disclosed in the course of the conference. I have some queries about this provision. The rights of children and their parents to access files under the Freedom of Information Act needs to be addressed in that context. Could such a provision be challenged?</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be an onus on health boards to accept the full recommendations of the family conference. The recommendations may require additional resources, which will have implications for the health boards, but should there be a responsibility on the health board to accept such recommendations or, at a minimum, to offer a written explanation as to what resources it requires to implement the recommendations of the family conference? A stronger provision should be included to ensure the health boards will be obliged to accept the full recommendations of a family conference. In many cases of which I am aware, the health board ignores its responsibilities because of a lack of resources. There should be strict and clear guidelines regarding the conducting and recording of con<Col N="488" /> ferences because these meetings are detailed and important. The reference to the role of the co-ordinator should be more explicit. There may be a need to consider a designated key worker system with statutory responsibility.</P>
    <P>Regarding special care orders, the Bill provides that children can be detained for their own good, even if they have not committed a criminal offence, because they cannot be helped otherwise. Such children will be detained in a place from which they cannot escape. We all accept that some children need this type of attention. I was asked to visit a couple recently who were most concerned about their 14 year old grandson. His mother is separated and is living with four children and another partner. The young boy is on the streets. He does not sleep at home because he does not like the family situation and he is mixing with highly undesirable people. The health board cannot do anything for him and the Garda is powerless because he has not committed a crime. However, unless something is done, undoubtedly he will do harm to himself or others.</P>
    <P>I mentioned my relief at the introduction of the Bill because it will help in such circumstances. The Garda will be able to intervene and the health boards will be in a position to put such children into care regardless of whether they have committed an offence. This is a welcome provision because it means there can be early intervention to stop a bad situation becoming much worse. The Bill will help many children in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The case of the young boy I mentioned is probably an extreme example but many Deputies are aware of similar cases. We read about such cases but we are unaware of the backgrounds of many of the children who are homeless and sleeping on our streets. However, under the Bill, the Garda, health boards and the relevant authorities will now be able to intervene at an early stage, consider the child's circumstances, understand the circumstances and establish a detention system.</P>
    <P>I attended an interesting conference two weeks ago in Cork on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; ADHD. This successful conference was organised by a group in Cork and was launched by the Minister for Health and Children. More than 500 people attended the conference, including teachers and others who work with children such as social workers, psychologists and many parents. The opening speaker was an expert in the area and he spoke to a silent audience for an hour about ADHD which is an illness that affects children. I do not suggest that every child who is sleeping on our streets or has shown criminal tendencies suffers from ADHD but it may be a contributory factor in many problem cases.</P>
    <P>ADHD is caused because of a missing chemical which operates the front part of the brain. However, it can be solved. Children who suffer from the condition are impulsive and act immediately without thinking. They can be violent and disturbed. In many cases, such children are repeatedly expelled from schools and their par<Col N="489" /> ents do not know what to do with them. The children are disruptive in school. They cannot sit still and they do not obey simple orders. Little intervention is required to help these children. However, most children are not diagnosed with the condition until they are 12 or 13 years.</P>
    <P>I spoke to parents of children whose problems have been identified. Many of the parents said they forced the issue and insisted there was something wrong with their children. Many of them had to go to London for a clinical diagnosis because they found it difficult to have the problem assessed in Ireland. However, since they got a diagnosis, there has been a vast improvement in their children. Many of them are on the drug, Ritalin. Family life is much easier and children are not wandering the streets or climbing out bedroom windows at night. They have peace. control and stability. They have at last solved the puzzle with which nobody was able to help them.</P>
    <P>I also spoke to teachers working in the field. They recognise the problem but they find it difficult to address. They see a five or six year old who is disruptive and will not sit down. He or she causes noise and back answers in class. The teacher may recognise the condition at an early stage but he or she is continually frustrated because there is little he or she can do in terms of intervention. This area needs to be addressed. The Minister for Health and Children also attended the conference and one interesting speaker was Mr. John Lonergan, the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, who deals with the end results of the condition.</P>
    <P>He recognises the problem but he considers that it can be solved through early intervention. It was inspiring to see a person such as Mr. Lonergan taking an interest in the conference and recognising that he is dealing with 18 year olds at the other end of the system. Something could be done for such children at the age of two, three, four or five years. They can be helped to deal with their problems.</P>
    <P>Many concerns arise in relation to the granting of special care orders. In granting such an order, consideration must be given to the behaviour of the child and the availability of services. Given the current absence of continual child care and family support services, there is a real fear that children's behaviour may be defined in terms which allow only for the granting of the order so that the services which are needed can be accessed.</P>
    <P>Orders will be granted for a period of six to 12 months. Children who are the subject of such orders will not be party to the proceedings and will have no automatic right to legal representation. It will be important to monitor the circumstances in which orders are granted and to ensure consistency among judges in this regard.</P>
    <P>Special care orders shall cease to have effect at the age of 18 &ndash; the Bill deals with children between the ages of 12 and 18 years &ndash; but what additional supports will be put in place for children whose families receive them after that date? <Col N="490" /> Will there be any intervention on behalf of or support for children after they reach that age or will there be a cut-off point? It is important that intervention and supervision should take place beyond 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>A great deal of responsibility will be placed on the Garda Síochána. There is a need to provide additional resources so that members of the force can be trained in areas such as children's health and psychological development. If gardaí are to hand such children over to the health boards, there is a need to stipulate the time which should elapse between their being handed over and the arrangement of a family welfare conference.</P>
    <P>The duration of the certificate of approval for the detention centre is to be three years. Does that mean inspections will occur only every three years? Given that most children will be detained for six to 12 months, more frequent inspections of units is warranted. In that context, there is a need to appoint further inspectors to make inspections more meaningful.</P>
    <P>The diversion programme places what is known as the juvenile liaison scheme on a statutory footing and renames it. Such diversions may involve a caution &ndash; formal or informal &ndash; to the child and their being placed under the supervision of a juvenile liaison officer and convening a conference to be attended by the child, its family members and other concerned persons, including the victim. It is good that these children should be obliged to confront their victims. Children must take responsibility for their acts before being admitted to this scheme. However, what will happen if the director of the scheme refuses a child admission?</P>
    <P>Juvenile liaison officers will have quite an amount of discretionary power as to whether to request a conference in respect of a child. Will these conferences be convened only where there is a perception they are likely to succeed? These are some of the potential flaws in the legislation and they must be highlighted. There is a need for an acknowledgement of the amount of time that is necessary to prepare for such conferences and one of the key elements of successful conferences is an independent co-ordinator. To increase the likelihood of successful conference outcomes, this consideration needs to be built into the programme.</P>
    <P>I question the appointment of a juvenile officer as the convenor and, possibly, the chairperson of such conferences. A person who could be perceived to be more neutral would be more appropriate. In addition, juvenile liaison officers will require further training if they are to take on these extra roles. It is essential that the programme should be independently evaluated.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are welcome for those of us who feel uncomfortable or who believe we are neglecting our duties as legislators by not taking action in respect of these children. An intervention would probably save these children's lives, set their families' minds at rest and, <Col N="491" /> I hope,  allow everyone to enjoy a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>Successive media reports about St. Patrick's institution have recommended that it be closed because it is not a suitable place to detain children. The Bill provides that those between 16 and 18 years of age can be detained. Without evidence to the contrary, I must assume they will be detained in St. Patrick's. That is a shame. We must recognise that St. Patrick's is an old, outdated building which does not suit the purpose for which it is being used.</P>
    <P>I hope the necessary resources will be provided to implement the varied and welcome provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Children Bill. As many speakers have already stated, this Bill has been long awaited but it will prove worth the wait. It has had the benefit of many additions in terms of research, experience and knowledge over the years from within the country and internationally.</P>
      <P>When one focuses on the Bill's title &ndash; the Children Bill &ndash; one thinks of it in positive terms. When one hears words such as &ldquo;offences&rdquo;, &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;, &ldquo;courts&rdquo; and &ldquo;care orders&rdquo;, one may change one's initial response and assume a negative approach is being taken to children. However, on further investigation, the Bill's positive message is that a child's place should be with its family and that children who come under its remit will be dealt with in terms of their rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The majority of children are good. This is borne out by my experience not only in life but also as a teacher. Sometimes the fact that such a majority of young people are good, fun-loving and decent is missed by the emphasis we place on those children who get into bother and attract headlines.</P>
      <P>Today we are dealing with children who got into difficulty, who are in danger of getting into trouble or who have behavioural problems. The Bill balances the needs of children who have offended with the protection of individuals or society in general. Therefore, the Bill addresses two aspects on one issue &ndash; some people may refer to these as the &ldquo;two victims&rdquo;&ndash; the child and, the most obvious victim, the person whose rights they have impinged upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that, for a number of reasons, a percentage of children are increasingly getting into trouble. In the past that may have meant a group stole apples from an orchard. Now, however, the traditional badness has escalated in severity. Not to be parochial but in an effort to provide a concrete and recent example of such behaviour, live entertainment was laid on in my home town three weeks ago which everyone enjoyed. However, more than 600 children &ndash; many of whom had not attained their teenage years &ndash; took over the town green and drank <Col N="492" /> their carry-outs from 11 a.m. until such time as they were not able to drink any more. They became abusive and violent early in the day and, subsequently, some of them varied or alternated being sick with being very vocal.</P>
    <P>The state of these children is a reflection of the extremes which obtain in modern society. While we hope this was very much a once-off incident, it is not a once-off in terms of what smaller groups of children are doing at night or at weekends. The people of our town wondered how these children were allowed to travel 20 miles on their own without adult supervision and how, when they returned home, their parents did not notice their state. For many of these children, it may have been their first time to drink alcohol. However, others among their number were more hardened to the activity in which they were engaged.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the issue of under-age drinking is not merely a problem for the individual on a particular day. More importantly, long range consequences can arise for the people involved, particularly young girls, and for those with whom they come into contact. Both parties may be victims, but until now neither has had a chance of justice or support commensurate with what I trust is contained in the Bill. In conjunction with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which was recently published and will soon be introduced, this legislation will offer solutions to this problem. I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the action he has taken on both fronts.</P>
    <P>To return to the 600 children to whom I referred earlier, I am sure they come from different backgrounds. Many of their parents will not yet know their children are involved in anti-social behaviour. Others, while responsible parents, will realise their children are difficult or, for one reason or another, out of control but they will feel at a loss as to which way to turn. Others, however, will not worry that their children are out of control as they have no sense of responsibility for these young people. In all cases, the effect of the young people on victims is the same but the type of solution for the children varies.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises the child's age of responsibility from seven to 12 years and provides that parents become more accountable for the actions of their children. They can be bound to exercise proper and adequate control over their child where the child has been found guilty of an offence. They can also be ordered to pay compensation if it is seen that there was wilful neglect on the part of the parents to look after and control the child. I am glad the compensation order takes into account the parents' ability to pay. All children want to be loved. Parents' wilful neglect will lead to a child seeking attention, usually through destructive means. Wilful neglect, therefore, often directly contributes to the child's behaviour and it is only right that the parents are reminded in this manner of their responsibilities as parents.</P>
    <P>In the long run, this must be a significant step in developing the concept of the family. It is <Col N="493" /> unfortunate that one almost has to coerce parents into a situation where they are made conscious of their children, the children's needs and, often, their mere existence. In some cases the carrot and stick approach employed in the Bill will work. In other cases the parents may not be in a position to help themselves. These are the people who truly need assistance. It is not good enough for society to point the finger, blame the parents and walk away. Help and support must be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this reality is being dealt with in the Bill through the potential use of a parental supervision order should wilful neglect of a child be seen to lead the child to criminal behaviour. In this instance, parents can be ordered by the court to undergo a parenting course if they are deemed not to have adequate personal skills and resources to look after the child or, if the problem is one of substance abuse, they can be ordered to go for treatment of the abuse. In the current climate where the abuse of alcohol is almost a norm in society, this is an important development in the Bill. The Minister said this response would probably be suitable for only a minority of cases. I disagree and I trust adequate resources will be allocated to parenting courses and places on rehabilitation courses. Even moderate cases should be given the option of availing of support.</P>
    <P>Too often parents are at a loss as to how to deal with their children. This can be due to the parents being young themselves. It can be due to medical, financial or social hardships and if the parents do not feel they have somebody to turn to when times got rough. They are unable to ask for help and the situation in the family gradually deteriorates until some member gets into trouble. While the Bill cannot be the answer to all ills, it must be resourced to address as many people as possible who, with a little intervention, could experience a dramatic improvement in their ability to cope.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to be effective, there must be a co-ordinated input from various Departments. The 600 plus children to whom I referred earlier felt the only excitement in which they could engage was drinking themselves to oblivion. It is a sad reflection on society that this is what such a large number of young people believe to be their only option. One must look at the facilities being provided for young people. Many responsible adults spend many hours helping young people to engage in music, sport and other forms of recreation. These allow children to express themselves and engage with others in a positive manner.</P>
    <P>While I commend my constituency colleague, Deputy McDaid, on his work in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, rural Ireland still has far to go with regard to the provision of proper facilities and resources. The concept of having one overall development that encompasses all groups in a town is a good approach. However, in many instances if there is no significant increase in the level of funding, <Col N="494" /> many young people will be without adequate facilities for many years to come. Without decent resources, the adults who are trying to do their bit in the community are left with an uphill struggle. I call on the Minister, Deputy McDaid, to assist the objectives of this Bill and to ensure as many children as possible are given an alternative to the trouble into which idleness leads them. This approach is underlined in sections 30 to 50.</P>
    <P>When a number of children gather in a threatening manner little can be done about it. However, there are measures in the Bill which could offer a victim support if the child is challenged by the law and brought to court. To let children have regular &ldquo;free-for-alls&rdquo; is only asking for trouble in the future. We need an appropriate number of law enforcers in towns to deal with the children who are usually known to the Garda and local community as troublemakers, for want of a better term. The number of gardaí must be worked out on the basis of not only the size of the town or village but also its proximity to larger towns and cities and its use as a social and recreational centre. There must also be garda visibility.</P>
    <P>I note that responsibility for establishing a family conference relies on the groundwork of the JLO, the juvenile liaison officers responsible for the delivery of reports and the supervision of the child. This sounds great on a one to one basis but in Donegal there are three juvenile liaison officers to cover a huge county. Unless the Bill is accompanied by serious delivery of Garda personnel specifically trained and geared for this single issue, the Bill cannot be effective. Each Garda station needs a JLO or a garda with special responsibility for young people. The Minister will be anxious to create something that not only looks good on paper but is capable of being implemented. Too often we give lip service to the concept of nurturing the young to create a confident, competent and dynamic new generation. Now is the time to match these words with the resources they deserve to make them reality.</P>
    <P>A number of parents do not worry about the whereabouts of their children. If these children have no constructive option as to how to spend their time and the law enforcers believe they are not sufficiently numerous to deal with those children when they become unruly, we are heading into anarchy. This scenario, while logical, might give the impression that all children are &ldquo;Lord of the Flies&rdquo; style evil but I do not believe that. However, the point must be made that everybody has a role to play in the positive development of young people.</P>
    <P>There must be community support for families and the strength and discipline to back up the community when such support fails. Perhaps there is a role within the local authorities' new special policy committee structures to convene the community support in a practical manner, bringing together elected representatives, health boards, vocational education committees, the Garda Síochána, sporting and voluntary groups <Col N="495" /> and young people to look at the role modelling or mentoring needs of future adults. Too often we omit that important group, the young people, when dealing with issues pertaining to them. This is a serious mistake.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is not being allowed to deal properly with its brief. When we discuss issues such as underage drinking and its health and social effects, we are directed to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, not the Department of Health and Children. This is either an abdication of responsibility or a flaw in the system. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, which has carried out significant work on the issue of tobacco addiction and the targeting of young people by the tobacco industry. The committee should also be able to examine alcohol addiction and its effect on young people. I am pressing to have this matter prioritised in the committee's work programme but responsibility for it still rests with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I praise the role of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, particularly with regard to the recently published intoxicating liquor Bill. However, there should be a more direct link between the Department of Health and Children and the welfare of all children. That Department should strive to take real responsibility for the child's welfare and health. This responsibility currently falls between stools.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the family welfare conferences on a statutory basis. This will enable health boards and other agencies to intervene at an early stage with regard to a child who requires special care and protection following a direction by the court and in other circumstances. The presence of the children at these conferences is a most important development. As the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, said, we talk too often about children and on their behalf. Often the person with most to offer is the person most involved, the child. Similarly, the amendment of the Child Care Act, 1991, which imposes a duty on the health board to apply for a special or interim special care order to protect children is important. This will ensure children with behavioural difficulties who are not necessarily committing offences can get protection, care and education through the board's additional range of powers. I echo Deputy Ring's comment on the latter aspect. Children with behavioural difficulties need support within the educational sphere. County Donegal currently shares an educational psychologist with another county. The provision of one educational psychologist between two counties is inadequate and until there is increased provision in this area there will be difficulty in implementing this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the first port of call is not detention. The majority of children are not so extreme as to need secure units. The Minister indicated that while the Bill will give the health boards the <Col N="496" /> power to detain children on receipt of a court order, it is a measure of last resort and will be used only in the interest of the child.</P>
    <P> Ultimately, prevention is better than cure and I trust the early intervention programme will be the most used of the measures. However, when children have committed offences, the environment in which they are detained should be such as to ensure that it is constructive and that children will develop in a positive manner. Too often we have images of young children who get into minor trouble finding themselves in an institution where they are taught more inventive ways of getting into trouble by more serious offenders. Surely this defeats the purpose of rehabilitation and will now be relegated to history.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Department of Education and Science will have a role in the rehabilitation of 12 to 16 year olds. It may have been better to extend the provision to 18 year olds, given that 16 to 18 year olds are so often treated as adults for punishment but not for adult privileges. Section 67 changes from 17 to 18 years the age at which a person is regarded as a child. Will the Minister outline his views on this aspect?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. All children will react to something positive. The planned adult conference has great potential. I recently visited a school on adult literacy or world book day. Some of the children told me they were not interested in books, but when I produced a small book on Manchester United they were surprised and said they would read it. They asked me to leave it with them so they could take it home for the weekend. All children, good, bad and indifferent, are good at something. Approached with a proper plan even the worst child can be brought along and can be included more in society.</P>
    <P>The Bill has at its core the importance not only of individual children, but also the parents. It pulls together support structures on an inter-agency basis. These include the child in their remit. These structures will work on behalf of all children and in the interests of individual children.</P>
    <P>We all know that while all children are different they have many similar tendencies. They all want to be loved and they all need care and protection, whether they are special needs children, children with behavioural difficulties, children on the edge of the law or those who have broken the law. The Bill provides that the family conferences will make an early start at intervention, not in an attempt to condemn the family but to offer services and assistance to not only the child but to the family.</P>
    <P>Even when the intervention of the courts is required, the Bill provides for continued efforts to be made to maintain family links and positive efforts to reintegrate and rehabilitate, and not to rely solely on detention. The Bill provides that a victim may attend the family conference. Section 26 provides for restorative measures, where the child confronts the effects of his or her behaviour in the presence of the victim and is given the <Col N="497" /> opportunity to apologise and make reparation. The intentions here are very good and with proper resourcing and continued cross-departmental implementation, it will be a historic advance for children. I look forward to the day it encompasses my 600 children who were from outside the jurisdiction. I trust that at some stage these provisions will have an affect on my Border county and on all children who enter this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. It has had a long gestation process. It was understandable that my colleague, Deputy Currie, made numerous requests about the publication of the Bill, because he was a pioneer in this area. When he published the Children Bill in 1996 the Minister, who was then his party's Opposition spokesperson on Justice, was very critical of it, despite the fact that this Bill does not appear to differ significantly from the original. It is worth reminding the House of what the Minister said at that time:</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to create the illusion of reform while maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> It represents a policy of acceptance and resignation rather than a vision for the future. It makes a clear statement that this is the best we can do. It is inadequate and its publication has been rushed to create a semblance of activity in an election year. A Government that is serious about juvenile justice would withdraw the Bill and acknowledge it for what it is &ndash; a shallow attempt at parliamentary scrabble to create the illusion of activity.</P>
      <P>Some of the Minster's statements at that time were very irresponsible. I always attempt to be constructive about legislation and there are many good elements in the Bill, especially the provisions regarding juvenile liaison officers. Other speakers have referred to the lack of resources in this area, despite the buoyancy of the Celtic tiger, which appears to be creating many problems in the area of children and for the child welfare services.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions that make child begging the responsibility of parents. There has been an increase in begging in all parts of the country, especially by the Romanians. Many come from the gypsy population of Romania and appear to resort to begging on a professional basis.</P>
      <P>The provisions to put the Garda juvenile liaison officer on a sounder statutory footing and to enhance the profile of the service is very desirable. It will be used widely. In addition, the concept of the family welfare conference is well worthwhile. It refers in many instances to the victimes of crime and allows them to appear in a conference situation to point out to the children at first hand the error of their ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the delay in publishing the Bill, Shakespeare's words &ldquo;procrastination is the thief of time&rdquo; is apt. There is a crisis in the child welfare service largely because of antiquated legislation. Legislation is improving and this Bill <Col N="498" /> and the Education (Welfare) Bill, dealing with truancy, are good examples. It is farcical that a young person should get a custodial sentence for truancy. Legislation is required to improve that. It is not a long-term solution to the welfare of young people to send them to prison for that because, given the difficulties with the prison system, they may end up with hardened criminals.</P>
    <P>The child care industry will absorb huge resources in the future. At a recent health board conference, I had the benefit of listening to a professional in the child care service, Ger Crowley, who works with the Mid-Western Health Board. People who work in this area operate in a difficult environment, especially in the health services, because of the cases reported to them with which they must deal. The delicacy of the situation and the sensitivity of the work they do was brought home forcefully to me by the changes which have taken place in society recently. These changes are the result of people breaking the shame barrier and exposing some of the deficiencies of institutions in the past and the media driving this agenda forcefully. Those who work in the service must now accept huge responsibilities because of the sensitivity of what they do.</P>
    <P>There is a serious lack of manpower in the service at present. Even before the Bill was published, it was recognised that 90 additional probation and welfare staff were required. The Probation and Welfare Service had to go on strike in May 1999 to get the Government to agree to provide the staff. Some 90 additional officers are required and 42 posts were approved last year, yet I understand only one post has been filled, although I stand to be corrected on that if I am wrong. An additional 91 staff are required to complement the existing 63.</P>
    <P>We as legislators have often passed legislation without putting in place the staff or finance to make it work. There is no point demanding legislation if we are not prepared to provide the staff to work it. Legislation alone will not solve the problem. It is of paramount importance that recruitment take place at an early stage to the Probation and Welfare Service and that it does not wait until the Bill is passed. The legislation will place greater responsibility on the service and on professionals in the health service involved in the care of children so it is imperative we provide staff now. I hope there is a commitment to do that. It is desirable and worthwhile that the diversion programme is being placed on a statutory footing and I look forward to developments in that area.</P>
    <P>We have all seen or read about how Ireland is progressing as an economy, yet in the past ten years, increasing numbers of people have been placed in care, either with foster parents or in residential institutions. That is not symptomatic of a progressive economy but of the malaise which exists. There has been a huge increase in the number of cases reported to the different health board services. The statistics are interesting. It is recognised by professionals that, <Col N="499" /> in many instances, cases of physical and sexual abuse are not reported to the health boards. I examined the number of child abuse cases reported in 1998. Of these, 1,970 were physical, 2,388 were sexual, 884 were emotional and 4,407 were neglect. It has been proved statistically that, within that cohort of figures, many come under the lone parent category.</P>
    <P>An expert recently described us as evolving into a latchkey society with more people, especially wives, going out to work because of the buoyant economy and children coming home in the afternoon, eating fast food dinners and not having anyone to talk to or counsel them. Will this manner in which society is evolving and the direction in which it is moving create within its slipstream disaffected young people? I am concerned about what is evolving in that regard.</P>
    <P>In percentage terms, neglect accounts for 46%, physical for 20%, sexual for 25% and emotional for 9% of reported child abuse cases. Those are intimidating figures. In 1988, which is not that long ago, 2,614 young people were in care. In 1998, despite our having advanced and despite all the talk about the Celtic tiger and the buoyancy of the economy, the number of people in care had increased to almost 4,000. That is a 52% increase in ten years. That encapsulates the intimidating situation we face in caring for vulnerable young people in future.</P>
    <P>The education system often impacts on vulnerable young people. While we are all delighted when a remedial teacher is appointed to four or five schools, we know it is farcical because we are not truly addressing the problems. We have only recently come to grips with attention deficit disorder and young people who suffer from it have often ended up involved in criminal activity. This is often due to neglect and the disorder not being identified. People who suffered from dyslexia were punished in many cases because the problem was not recognised. We should examine these matters, even, it is only within the remedial service, to see if we are pinpointing problems.</P>
    <P>How can 25% of the adults in this country, which is probably recognised as one of the most progressive in the OECD in economic terms, have literacy problems? That is a shocking indictment of the system. If the hard core of unemployed which remains is analysed, it will be seen that many of them suffer from illiteracy. Such people are placed on FÁS training programmes to remove them from the live register. If a training programme were put in place to give such people basic literacy skills and they were paid for the period of the course, it might do more long-term good for the their job prospects than what prevails at present. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is trying to reduce the numbers on community employment programmes because she believes many of them are on the programmes year after year. However, if people leave CE after a maximum of three years or whatever, in most cases they will revert to <Col N="500" /> being unemployed. I know I have digressed in discussing the adult situation in what is a Bill dealing with children, but they all have a bearing on the difficulties which exist.</P>
    <P>This is worthwhile legislation but it will succeed only if the required manpower resources are provided. There is a major problem with recruiting sufficient numbers of people to adequately staff and manage the intent of the legislation. I hope the powers that be will be forthcoming in providing the resources required to fully implement the legislation.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill, 2000, provides for the offences of supplying or offering to supply a vehicle to an under age driver and of organising, directing or participation in the unlawful taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle for the purposes of dangerous driving in a public place, to extend the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1995, and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important element of a package of measures which the Labour Party believes must be implemented to address one of the most serious and dangerous crimes affecting modern Irish society, particularly the most deprived areas of our cities and towns. At a recent seminar organised by the Labour Party on joyriding and car related crime, the Labour Party leader, Deputy Quinn, rightly referred to the crimes of car theft and joyriding as an urban plague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the past two decades this plague has terrorised residential estates, disrupted family life and placed the lives of citizens and our gardaí in continuous danger. Residents have grown to dread the screeching sound of cars being driven at speeds of up to 80 or 100 miles an hour and the terrifying spinning of cars in so-called &ldquo;wheelies&rdquo; on residential roads and open spaces in day<Col N="501" /> light as well as during the night or early morning. The arrival of joyriding cars in estates is often accompanied by a cacophony of whistles to try to attract the audience of young people who, if they are allowed to come out to view the mayhem, are placed in great physical danger. Like many other urban public representatives, I have regular first hand experience of the joyriding phenomenon. I watched in shock and disbelief recently as a speeding car suddenly spun in circles a few metres from the rear of my vehicle as I visited an estate in my Dublin North-East constituency.</P>
    <P>The most tragic aspect of joyriding and car crime in recent years has been the significant number of deaths and injuries of innocent pedestrians and car users. The first major effort to change the physical environment to deter car criminals on the north side of Dublin only took place when two children were knocked down six years ago in north Coolock and innocent passengers were killed on the Malahide and Raheny roads. There have also been several near misses recently in the Donaghmede Shopping Centre in my constituency. Similar tragedies have occurred on the south and west sides of Dublin and in Cork and Limerick cities.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of joyriding on an Adjournment debate this time last year following the appalling deaths of Mr. Derek Hall in Tallaght and Mr. Mark Bryan in Lucan. A Dublin hackney driver and father of four children, Mr. Hall died when a stolen car driven by three joyriding youths slammed into his Toyota cab. The well known and popular disc jockey, Mr. Mark Bryan from Dún Laoghaire, was killed when a 20 year old car thief who was out on bail drove up the wrong side of the Lucan bypass.</P>
    <P>Six months later the cruel and dangerous nature of car crime was brought home to many community activists in Dublin and throughout Ireland and to many members of the Labour Party with the horrific deaths of Mr. Richard Greene and his daughter, Christine, as they went to work on an early autumn morning. Mr. Richard Greene was a founder of the Donnycarney Unemployment Action Group and was deeply involved for many years in the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed. He was a strong advocate of community action to improve the local economy and society and of major initiatives, such as the Northside Partnership, and he gave great encouragement to me and countless others who were involved in local development projects. Nothing can ease the grievous sense of futile loss felt by their family and the families and communities of tragic victims of joyriding crime. In tribute to their memory, the Government and the House should embark on a co-ordinated list of measures to remove the plague of this crime from our streets.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Garda Commissioner show that almost 14,000 cars have been stolen nationally in each of the past two years. In recent weeks Dublin Corporation removed up to 166 burnt out and vandalised cars and South Dublin <Col N="502" /> County Council had to deal with more than 250 destroyed vehicles littering the roads and public open spaces. Since last January the problem has been exacerbated with the introduction of the national car test for older cars. Rather than undergo the cost of necessary repairs and the NCT, some unscrupulous owners and dealers have off loaded their vehicles to children who have vandalised them or used them for joyriding. The motor industry must take some responsibility for the disposal of their products given the introduction of the NCT.</P>
    <P>For many years the core of the joyriding problem in areas such as Dublin's north side has been the so-called company cars rather than stolen vehicles. Company cars are often clapped out old bangers and older vehicles which are sold to young people for as little as £15 or £20. They are then brought into residential estates where they are driven recklessly and burnt out. The Bill seeks to strengthen the hands of the gardaí, particularly in relation to discarded vehicles and company cars.</P>
    <P>It is not a coincidence that car related crime is a major problem for the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland. It has been compared to drug related crime because of its malign influence on so many struggling communities in our cities and towns. Like drug related crime, car theft and joyriding are symptoms of alienation and despair among youths who have dropped out of the education system and have been poorly resourced in terms of youth, leisure and sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that a large and growing minority of our people have been left behind at a time when the Celtic tiger is booming and economic growth is at 10%. The Government has paid lip service to their needs. When Government action was necessary, any measures taken were of a token nature, extremely tardy and disappointing to the communities concerned. I could cite many examples but I will mention just a few, such as the air of uncertainty left hanging over the partnership companies and their future role and funding after January 2000, the abrupt and careless manner in which the local employment service was treated for more than a year by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the failure by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to allocate sufficient resources for local youth and sporting facilities and the ongoing refusal by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to fund child care.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also failed our poorest communities. He came to power on a promise of zero tolerance and is now the longest serving Minister for Justice of the past decade. However, there is a strong perception in many urban and rural communities that he is presiding over a growing wave of youth lawlessness and criminal misbehaviour. The reports of the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Byrne, show decreases in reported crime levels in recent years but a recent survey revealed much larger <Col N="503" /> levels of unreported crime, particularly harassment of families by gangs of deviant youths and terrorising of communities as a result of joyriding and car theft.</P>
    <P>When preparing the Bill and submissions for the recent Labour Party seminar on joyriding, I was struck by reports I received from around the country about an upsurge in serious youth related crime. Yet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform served for almost three years before he introduced the Children Bill, despite constant promptings in this House from my colleagues, particularly Deputies Howlin and Shortall. The failure to expedite the Children Bill has hampered the Garda and the courts in providing for the education and placement of young offenders. The Minister must take responsibility for placing our communities and gardaí in serious jeopardy by requiring them to repeatedly rearrest young offenders for joyriding because there are no treatment or custodial places for them. In one case a person was arrested 45 times. It is totally unacceptable that there are only 34 secure remand places for male juveniles in the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues should have introduced a comprehensive programme of measures to control and end car related crime early on. Tonight is the 20th occasion I have raised the issue of joyriding in the 28th Dáil. I have also raised it in questions to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business, Adjournment debates, parliamentary questions, letters and brief conversations with the Minister and the Taoiseach. I have repeatedly asked for a multi-agency task force type response along the lines of the drug task forces established by my Labour colleagues and their Fine Gael allies in the last Government. I am strongly of the view that major resources to fund education, car and vehicle education, youth and community centre provision, local estate management and additional help for hard pressed gardaí in the worst affected areas are central to the control and resolution of this problem.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the support and foresight of Assistant Commissioner, Jim McHugh, and Superintendents Flynn and Long and to Inspector Seamus Kane for helping to establish the anti-joyriding task force on Dublin's north side. As a result of conversations with task force members and supporters, I undertook to examine how any gaps in the law could be remedied along the lines of the Control of Horses Act which dealt with the urban horse problem in 1996. That was the genesis of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for two new driving offences, supplying or offering to supply a vehicle to an under age driver for use in a public place and organising, directing or participation in unlawfully taking a vehicle for the purposes of dangerous driving in a public place.</P>
    <P>Section 1 proposes that a person who supplies or offers to supply a vehicle to an under-age driver where there is a reasonable apprehension that the vehicle will be used for joyriding shall be <Col N="504" /> guilty of an offence. &ldquo;Supply&rdquo; will include the gift of a vehicle and its transfer by way of sale, hire, loan or otherwise and &ldquo;under age driver&rdquo; means a person under 16 years. In subsection (2)(b) the Bill lays down that it is immaterial whether the person who supplied or offered to supply the vehicle was the lawful owner or otherwise in lawful possession of it. Section 1, if enacted, will, therefore, end the menace of so-called &ldquo;company cars&rdquo; and place a grave responsibility on car owners and car dealers to ensure that their older vehicles are lawfully disposed of.</P>
    <P>When drafting this Bill our Labour Party legal advisers and I carefully studied the 1961, 1968 and 1995 Road Traffic Acts in relation to the crime of taking a vehicle without authority. The 1968 Act provides, in section 65, that a person shall not use or take possession of a mechanically propelled vehicle or allow himself or herself to be carried in it without the consent of the owner or other lawful authority. The dangerous and deviant culture of joyriding has become primarily a feature of life, however, in the past 15 or 20 years and it was felt necessary to clearly define and prohibit it in law. Hence section 2 proposes that any person who organises, directs or participates in the taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of the owner or other lawful authority for the purposes of that vehicle being driven in a dangerous manner in a public place shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) provides that where facts are proven against a person amounting to an offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by section 65 of the 1968 Act previously referred to, then that person shall be presumed to be guilty of an offence until the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party gave some considerable thought to whether we should use the term &ldquo;joy riding&rdquo; at all since many citizens and public representatives find the term offensive considering the amount of mayhem, suffering and death that have been caused by this criminal deviancy. Due to this many of us have, in the past, referred to this crime as death riding or grief riding. I remember campaigning on Dublin City Council to use the latter term. Since there is a long standing practice to refer to the crime in communities and in the media as joyriding we decided it would be clearer to use the traditional term as in the title of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 prescribes severe penalties for offences under these proposals. A person guilty of an offence shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of up to £1,500 or to imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months or both. On conviction on indictment, an offender shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £25,000 or to imprisonment for up to seven years or both. We feel that these severe penalties would reflect the seriousness of car related crime which has often been deeply underestimated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the media and by this House. Section 4 entitles the Bill as the Road <Col N="505" /> Traffic (Joyriding) Act, 2000, and lays down that it may be cited and construed together with the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1995, as the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-2000.</P>
    <P>A major aspect of discussions on car crime at the recent Labour Party seminar was the disposal and scrappage of old and unwanted vehicles. Conor Faughnan of the Automobile Association made a valuable suggestion that there should be in effect a &ldquo;death certificate&rdquo; for cars for which the last legal owner would be liable. Other contributors felt that vehicles should not be allowed to be sold without a current car tax disc in use. These are proposals which are difficult to include in this Bill but to which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, should give urgent attention. This is especially the case in the context, mentioned in today's newspaper, of an incredible 104,000 new cars bought in the first three months of this year and of Mr. Faughnan's estimate of at least 100,000 cars being scrapped, partly as a result, this year. This seems a low estimate following the dramatic drop in value of older cars since the introduction of the NCT. It is an important phenomenon that, on the introduction of the NCT, there has been an incredible drop in the value of cars over eight or nine years old. It is something to which we should give attention.</P>
    <P>Once again our unfortunate Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been overtaken by events which he should have foreseen. It is clear that the Minister has the requisite powers to ensure that car manufacturers, distributors and owners properly scrap and dispose of their unwanted old vehicles. For that reason the Labour Party did not include a scrappage scheme in the Bill before us. It was the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, in the Rainbow Coalition Government who introduced and had passed the Waste Management Act, 1996. Section 29 of that Act allows the Minister for the Environment to make regulations in relation to the recovery of any class of waste product. Subsection (4) of that section permits the Minister to require any producer, distributor, retailer or purchaser of any product or component for which there is no further use to collect, take back, or arrange the collection or taking back of the product or component or to arrange for its delivery to an authorised waste collector or another specified facility. This subsection also requires documents and records relating to waste recovery to be kept and for a plan to be made specifying the steps taken to recover all waste products. Is it not extraordinary that Minister for the Environment and Local Government has not made the slightest effort to bring section 29 of the 1996 Act into operation in relation to by far the largest and most difficult product, namely, cars?</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a significant responsibility on the Society for the Irish Motor Industry and <Col N="506" /> vehicle manufacturers and retailers generally to ensure the safe disposal and scrappage of their products. It is the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as usual, who has failed to enforce a key element of his brief with regard to the motor industry. From tonight and in conjunction with this Labour Bill, I urge him, even belatedly, to take action.</P>
    <P>In my letters to An Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on 3 February last, as Social and Community Affairs spokesperson of the Labour Party, I asked for an urgent multi-agency programme of measures to deter and end joyriding as well as for Government support for this Bill. I have always been fully aware that a legislative approach on its own would be of little use. I am, therefore, urging again that all possible assistance and resources be given to groups throughout the country like the Northside Anti-Joyriding Task Force, chaired by leading community activist, Mr. John Curry, PC, a long time friend and colleague of mine, and expertly facilitated by Inspector Seamus Kane and Sergeant Donal Waters of Coolock Garda.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are similar initiatives in Finglas, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght, on the northside of Cork city, in Limerick and in other urban areas. It is imperative that all key local agencies, including the local authority, the health board, partnership companies, FÁS and public representatives as well as the Garda and community leaders should be represented on these initiatives. Perhaps the Taoiseach would request the new city and county development boards to co-ordinate a multi-agency fight against joyriding crime.</P>
    <P>Clearly there has always been an attraction to speed and fast vehicles among young men and women; youngsters who have dropped out of education and are perhaps also addicted to drink and drugs are particularly vulnerable in this regard. The Labour Party, therefore, believes the Government and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, must commit more resources to education in the affected areas to engender an attitude of responsibility and safety towards cars and other vehicles especially among pre-teenage children.</P>
    <P>We were particularly impressed by accounts of the work of the youth service and teachers in Neilstown, Clondalkin, whose video and educational programme might be replicated around Dublin and Ireland. It is fair to say also that a number of young people who became involved in joyriding crime have a genuine interest in driving and car maintenance. One of the most notable contributions ot the Labour seminar came from Robert O'Connor, the project director of City Motor Sports, an initiative in education and car maintenance for youths who have been caught joyriding in Dublin's south inner city. A subsequent visit to the project by the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, and myself confirmed our very favourable impression of the work of Mr. <Col N="507" /> O'Connor and his team. We believe that this programme should be better resourced and that there is scope for similar schemes in all the areas worst affected by car crime. Perhaps our colleagues in FÁS might take a lead role in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>In many of our most deprived urban areas it is completely unacceptable that our youth service has to exist on a shoestring budget of finance and youth worker provision. In many of the same areas, for example, Priorswood Parish in the constituency of Dublin North-East, there is no dedicated youth services building after 30 years of the parish's existence. More exasperatingly, in a nearby northside parish, the youth service ceased to exist for nearly five months recently due to administrative bungling.</P>
    <P>The Minister will no doubt refer to the 24 Garda youth diversion projects whose work has been welcome in areas worst affected by youth crime but this programme, from the Rainbow era, still receives minimal Government support. Clearly there is still a need for the urgent provision for a comprehensive national youth service with dedicated modern buildings.</P>
    <P>The current debate about the proposal for a national sports stadium and campus, with which the Taoiseach is heavily identified, has highlighted the uses to which the estimated £270 million cost of this project could be deployed to local sports facilities and clubs. For many of these a changing room is still the side of a ditch and the renting of indoor training facilities is a constant financial drain. Yet the present Government, with a growing £6 billion surplus &ndash; is it £7 billion tonight? &ndash; seems content to let our young sportsmen and women continue to suffer. Last year, for example, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, gave funding to only 406 of the 1,900 local sports and leisure clubs which applied under the national lottery funded sports capital grants. The total Government expenditure nationally on these grants was a miserly £10 million or 0.2% of last year's massive budget surplus. This sum would perhaps just meet the needs of the gaelic, soccer, athletic, community and social clubs in Dublin North-East just one of our 42 constituencies. This shows the futility and arrogance of this Government towards the leisure needs of local communities, particularly those with serious youth alienation and crime problems.</P>
    <P>The introduction of local authority estate management was a belated response to a campaign led by the Labour Party and its left wing colleagues. Welcome changes to the physical environment have been carried out to restrict and deter joyriding but much more needs to be done. The Dublin local authorities, for example, still do not accept that they have an absolute duty of care and security to tenants and their families whose lives are made a living hell by joyriding crime. This principle may be exercised by tenants groups in the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> When this mayhem erupts, often late at night or early in the morning, it is invariably the gardaí or community and public representatives who have to try to cope. While new local management and democratic structures are still in their infancy, responses to calls for environmental changes and maintenance of estates are still far too slow and erratic. In short, local government services need to take joyriding and the harassment of families seriously.</P>
    <P>Throughout the north Dublin region and rural Ireland, communities are grateful to gardaí who have often, and almost on a daily and nightly basis, risked their lives and well-being to protect communities. For this wonderful service we are forever in their debt. I have long requested additional resources, particularly manpower, for the Garda Siochána in areas worst affected by joyriding. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined that between 70 to 100 additional gardaí are needed to adequately police the J and R districts on the north side of Dublin where more than 100,000 people live. Similar demands could be made for other areas worst affected by youth and car crime.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the Garda should reflect local, parish and administrative structures which they do not at present. This would ensure that areas with the worst problems have the correct number of staff. There should also be constant and close Garda liaison with local representative bodies. I am not aware if my proposal for a dedicated anti-joyriding specialist Garda team has been implemented but it should be a priority in the regions affected by car crime. The proposal for a freephone number for reporting joyriding should also be implemented.</P>
    <P>Early action on the measures and proposals outlined would constitute some of the main elements of a comprehensive response to the terrifying, socially disruptive and deadly crime of joyriding and car theft. Such a response has never been more urgent. The Government can take the first step by accepting this Bill. Last November the Minister promised me that he would strongly consider allocating Government time to any remedial proposals the Labour Party brought forward to end the menace of car crime. The Minister will have his own ideas in terms of amending the brief proposals before the House but the central proposals of severe penalties for joyriding, <i>per se</i>, and outlawing of the transfer of company cars to youngsters will, I hope, receive his and the Government's support. Let us have no more victims of this unnecessary and horrific crime. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Broughan for introducing this Bill and on the great work on this issue. Anyone listening to his speech can tell that he has worked very hard with communities and the Garda Siochána. The least response he could receive from the House would be an acceptance of this Bill by the Government. I hope the Government will accept and <Col N="509" /> implement the Bill as soon as possible. However, the Government should not just implement the contents of the Bill but the variety of other measures necessary if we are to get rid of the scourge of joyriding.</P>
      <P>There is no joy in joyriding for the communities affected by it. Deputy Broughan outlined why we kept the word &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; in the title of the Bill. It is a misnomer but that is how it is described in society. Joyriding is a most dangerous pursuit for those in the cars and for communities. We have all seen the tragedies which result and we have been affected by the tragedies suffered by communities around the country. There is a chilling and terrifying chasm between some of these young people and the communities around them. Anyone who has come across these young offenders will see that they do not connect with their communities or relate to the tragedy they are inflicting on others, including young children and the elderly. This is truly horrifying and something with which we must come to grips.</P>
      <P>We have to support and fund any projects, ideas or activities proposed by communities to combat the threat of joyriding. This is one of the problems with this Government, despite the fact that there is so much money available. Grants are available but projects must fit the grant system rather than the grants fitting the projects. We must make the surplus money available to communities who are seeking support for projects. Some good work is being done as regards sports capital grants but many communities with excellent ideas do not qualify for them. One can obtain a grant for a new dressing room or such like, however, grants are not available for ongoing costs such as, for example, running a football club, boxing club, marching band, dance group or whatever in a deprived area. It is often impossible to keep such groups going and we need to ring fence funding.</P>
      <P>There was an announcement today concerning the money raised from the taxation of 00 registered cars. Let us ring fence such a fund and place it at the disposal of communities which need and deserve such support. These communities are not lacking in ideas and we all know of projects crying out for funding.</P>
      <P>There is a soccer academy in Southill, Limerick, which trains youngsters under a CE scheme. This academy is one point of connection with many young men who might otherwise be anti-social. These people have an interest in soccer and many of them have interests in other areas. These tenuous links must be nurtured and people working on them must receive the necessary funding. There is no point in allocation grants if people cannot get to them. We have to target grants and support projects in these communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also support estate management. Yesterday I attended the launch of a partnership approach to estate management in Limerick. One of the speakers made the point that there is a need for a bottom-up approach in that we must respond to what communities say they need <Col N="510" /> rather than what local authorities, the Government or the Minister say they need. We must involve estate managers in putting forward proposals and in getting them funded. We need a caring and responsive approach to these people now rather than a response in one or two years. We must respond to what is happening. Many communities are suffering from terrifying activities.</P>
    <P>There is a need to prioritise the targeting of resources towards families at risk. Organisations such as Barnardos are doing slow and painstaking work and they must be supported. Studying youngsters from the age of one to four years, one can predict the ones likely to end up joyriding. Early intervention is crucial for such youngsters.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increased number of burnt out cars, I am a member of an environmental committee in my local authority where there was a 40% increase in the number of such cars taken in by the local authority between January to March 1999. Recycling companies will do this work, so it is a question of telling them where the cars are. The connection between garages and those who buy and sell cars must be apparent and people must be forced to ensure that cars are properly recycled rather than left for youngsters.</P>
    <P>There is a very high level of anti-social behaviour and we must have the Garda resources to deal with this problem. Gardaí must take preventive action rather than arriving after the deed is done. We need imaginative responses from the Garda. They have to get out of their squad cars and walk around in these communities to deter the kind of activities we are debating.</P>
    <P>We have to support communities living in fear. The Bill is only a part of that process but it is an important part as it will jolt us into realising the problem and dealing with it, not just in terms of the provisions of the Bill, but in terms of the wider social responses needed. The Minister must fund the projects that have identified the problems and possible solutions to them.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim comhghairdeas le mo chomhtheachta den Pháirtí Lucht Oibre, an Teachta Broughan, as ucht an Bhille thábhachtach seo, an Bill um Thrácht ar Bhóithre (Spraoithiomáint), 2000, a chur os comhair na Dála. I congratulate Deputy Broughan for bringing this important Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The first time I attended the Oireachtas as a Member was in early 1987 when I was elected to the Seanad. The first meeting took place on a Saturday. I left at 11 p.m. to return home. As I was driving along the canal in the direction of the Naas Road, I realised that a car approaching me was on the wrong side of the road. I pulled over and it passed. In my mirror I saw it perform a hand brake turn behind me. It then approached the junction at high speed. The driver was not bothered if the light was green or otherwise. The car turned onto the Naas Road and when I arrived it was doing hand brake turns on that road before leaving. That was my first experience of joyriding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The importance of this Bill was demonstrated to me during the local elections last year when I was canvassing with a colleague on a large housing estate. Adjacent to the estate was a green area belonging to the local authority. A car containing two youths appeared. It had no registration plates and was missing at least one window. The person to whom I was speaking told me that youths would buy cars for £10, drive around the green area and then burn them when they were finished. I telephoned the gardaí and told the officer who answered the telephone what was happening. He told me that they were not in contravention of the Road Traffic Acts, although the gardaí did come swiftly and chased the two youths involved. That green area could have been used by children or senior citizens.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that this can happen. It is only by accepting the Bill proposed by Deputy Broughan that we can deal with these issues. It would prevent unscrupulous people from selling cars to young people, particularly those under age, and to make it a crime to steal a car to joyride or drive at high speed. I hope the Government will not oppose the Bill and, instead, promise to introduce its own Bill at some time in the future. The Bill should be accepted and the necessary amendments made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government should accept the Bill and facilitate its quick passage because the number of vehicles being abandoned or left in garages as result of the national car test is growing all the time. Deputy Broughan suggested that the motor industry, which is making huge profits at present, should invest money so cars can be scrapped in an environmentally friendly way. There is no doubt that the number of burnt out wrecks is increasing.</P>
    <P>This phenomenon demonstrates the underlying problems in law enforcement. There is a high level of unreported crime. I come from the area of the State with the highest crime detection rate, Waterford-Kilkenny, and while that is welcome crime prevention is more important. It requires resources. We must intervene early to prevent young people from becoming disaffected and involved in anti-social behaviour. Co-ordination of services is vital. There is a lack of infrastructure in alternative activities for young people in disadvantaged areas which might prevent alcohol or drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Economic success has passed many people by. The record of the Minister leaves much to be desired. Since April 1998 there have been 15 gangland killings, including one close to where I live. In that case the remains of the person have not been retrieved. No one has been charged with murder in any of the cases. There are common threads running through them all, they are drug related and were carried out by gangs, but no progress is being made.</P>
    <P>There is a viciousness in attacks now. Over the weekend a Welsh visitor was badly injured in <Col N="512" /> Roscrea, there was a murder in Ennis and there was a serious assault in Portlaw where people were celebrating a lottery win. In Tramore recently a petrol pump attendant was badly beaten and it would appear that his assailants, who robbed the petrol station, were contemplating dragging him behind their car had a rope been available. We are not getting to grips with these crimes.</P>
    <P>People who are being intimidated and harassed come to us for help but they are afraid to give evidence in case of reprisals. The attitude of the Minister to crime prevention and detection is defective. It is far from the confidence we saw when he was in Opposition. Then he was going to change things in a very short time. I ask the Minister of State to accept this small but important Bill that deals with this dangerous anti-social activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy Broughan for introducing the Bill. Joyriding is an anti-social behaviour perpetrated primarily by a small minority of young people, many of whom are victims of social disadvantage. However, social and economic disadvantage is not an excuse for this type of dangerous behaviour which, in some cases, leads to tragedy. We need a range of effective policies and measures to tackle it.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Deputy has a particular concern about joyriding in his constituency and raised this matter in the House on previous occasions. I am also aware that a new dimension to joyriding may have developed recently whereby young persons are no longer taking vehicles without the owner's consent but are sometimes purchasing quite old cars for small sums of money. These cars can sometimes be driven dangerously or used in the commission of crime.</P>
      <P>Tackling joyriding behaviour requires a multi-agency approach. My colleague, Deputy Carey, will outline the strong measures taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to tackle this issue.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether the vehicle has been taken without the owner's consent or has been purchased from another person, the subsequent use of that vehicle to drive recklessly, often through housing estates, creates a serious danger to other road users, pedestrians and, in many cases, the young drivers themselves as well as the occupants of the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the issue of anti-social behaviour, joyriding poses manifest dangers in a road safety context. Human action is a contributory factor in more than 90% of road accidents. The principal emphasis of all road safety strategies is on improving road user behaviour. This behaviour <Col N="513" /> must involve consideration for others to reduce risk.</P>
    <P>The Government's road safety strategy sets out to make a measurable impact on road deaths and injuries in Ireland over its five year term. The strategy's primary target is to achieve at least a 20% reduction in deaths and serious injuries by 2002 relative to 1997. This target will be achieved through a concerted effort in the three key areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing and the implementation of a range of measures designed to improve human behaviour and to make our vehicles and roads safer.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Government's road safety strategy, substantial improvements have been made in terms of accident reduction, given that 3% fewer people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997 and 12% fewer people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997. That represents the lowest number of serious injuries for the last decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target in the Government strategy.</P>
    <P>More recent data from the Garda Síochána indicate there were 413 road deaths in 1999 compared with 458 in 1998. That represents a reduction of 13% in road deaths relative to 1997 in the second full year of operation of the strategy. There has also been substantial progress in the implementation of the measures set out in the strategy designed to help achieve the main targets of reducing road deaths and serious injuries.</P>
    <P>In countering the speed factor in road accidents, the use of automatic mobile speed detection systems has been extended and the Garda is currently finalising arrangements for the operation of fixed speed detection cameras on routes north and west out of Dublin, including the M50.</P>
    <P>In the continued implementation of Operation Lifesaver, significant increases in the detection of offences have been made. The Garda issued more than 175,000 on the spot fine notices for speeding in 1999 compared to 130,000 in 1998 and 71,000 in 1997. Increased enforcement of drink driving laws is evidenced in the 19% increase in 1998 over 1997 of samples certified by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in relation to drink driving offences. There was a further increase of 8% in 1999 compared to 1998.</P>
    <P>As a key measure in combating the alcohol factor in road accidents, the operation of evidential breath testing commenced at the end of 1999 in four Garda stations &ndash; Pearse Street, Dún Laoghaire, Tallaght in Dublin and Castlebar in County Mayo. The system is scheduled to be introduced to at least 20 more Garda stations nationwide in the coming 12 to 18 months. The selection of those Garda stations is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The use of evidential breath testing has been proven in many other jurisdictions to have a positive impact on driver behaviour. It means that drivers may be required to undergo a breath test in a Garda station instead of a blood or urine test following arrest for drink driving. The breath test<Col N="514" /> ing apparatus, which will be subject to quality controls operated by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, will automatically record the driver's alcohol level without the need for any further medical or analytical process.</P>
    <P>Early in 1999 the Minister made regulations to extend the on the spot fines system to non-wearing of seat belts and a range of other road safety related offences. More than 25,000 seat belt notices were issued by the Garda between August and December 1999.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority completed specific accident reduction measures at 193 known accident locations on the national network in 1998 and 1999 and a further 100 are scheduled for 2000. The Government has provided £0.5 million in the non-national road grant allocations for 2000 to fund a similar programme of accident counter-measures on non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The heads of a new Road Traffic Bill are being prepared in my Department to provide a legislative base for the system. This will be brought before the Government as quickly as possible with a view to the earliest possible publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill's approach in tackling the problem with joyriding is interesting. However, the Bill's approach is not technically feasible for a number of reasons. With regard to the prohibition on the supply of vehicles to under age drivers, the existing Road Traffic Acts focus primarily on the use of vehicles in public places. They do not address the question of supply which may be more appropriate for inclusion in legislation relating to the supply of goods.</P>
    <P>Section 2 effectively tries to create a new offence of joyriding, that is, directing, organising or participating in the unauthorised taking of a vehicle for the purpose of dangerous driving. The practical enforcement of this section in the courts would be extremely difficult. It would be necessary to prove that a person who organised, directed or participated in the taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle did so for the purpose of that vehicle being driven in a dangerous manner. This provision, while well intended, would be unworkable in practice.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; does not feature in existing legislation and it is a phrase which should be avoided, given the suffering and loss that is associated with the practice. However, the component elements of what is commonly termed joyriding are already extensively provided for under existing road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>The unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the owner's consent is already an offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. That section provides:</P>
    <P>(a)A person shall not use or take possession of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of the owner thereof or other lawful authority.</P>
    <P>(b)Where possession of a vehicle has been taken in contravention of this subsection, a person who knows of the taking shall not allow <Col N="515" /> himself to be carried in or on it without the consent of the owner thereof or other lawful authority.</P>
    <P>A summary conviction under this Act carried a fine of up to £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to 12 months or both a fine and imprisonment. A conviction under this section also leads to the application of a consequential disqualification order. In addition, a conviction on indictment carries a fine of up to £2,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to five years or both.</P>
    <P>The offence of dangerous driving is provided for in section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended. A member of the Garda Síochána who suspects someone of dangerous driving can arrest that person without warrant. There are harsh penalties for anyone convicted of dangerous driving. A person convicted of dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm can be liable for penal servitude of up to five years or, at the discretion of the court, a fine of up to £3,000 or both. In any other case, a fine of up to £1,000 can be imposed or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to six months or both. A conviction under this section also leads to the application of a consequential disqualification order.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Road Traffic Regulations made under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 give the Garda Síochána the power to detain and impound a vehicle where the vehicle is being driven by an under age driver and/or the driver has no motor insurance cover. Young people who participate in joyriding are often in the under 16 age group. Anyone under the age of 16 is prohibited from holding a driving licence under section 31 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. A person cannot drive without a licence. Driving without a licence is an offence under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 and conviction carries the penalty of a fine of up to £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment of up to six months or both.</P>
    <P>A person who has taken a vehicle without the owner's consent or has purchased a very old vehicle for a small sum is unlikely to have the required motor insurance. It is an offence to drive a vehicle in a public place without motor insurance under section 56 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. Conviction carries a fine of up to £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to six months or both.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, there is already extensive and comprehensive legislation to deal with the component elements that constitute joyriding along with provisions to cover other offences such as driving without a licence or insurance. The Garda Síochána have indicated that these provisions are adequate in dealing with these issues. The question of enforcement is one for the Garda Síochana.</P>
    <P>While the general purpose of the Bill in trying to tackle the issue of joyriding by under age driv<Col N="516" /> ers is commendable, I regret it is not capable of being amended at this stage to produce satisfactory legislation, therefore, I must oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to Deputy Broughan's Bill and compliment him on introducing it. I am aware of his interest in this matter which he has displayed in many fora for a long time. He and I are both members of Dublin Corporation. We share membership of the board of Round Limited, the company which administers funds in north Dublin through the urban programme. I have heard him speak on many occasions about this issue. He represents a constituency which is similar to mine and I certainly understand the sentiments of the Bill and share many of the concerns he has articulated.</P>
      <P>There is plenty of evidence that the Government takes youth crime seriously and it has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to address the issue. As everyone in the House will be aware, the level of resources the Government has made available for youth facilities and services in Dublin is proof of its determination to tackle the root causes of social deprivation and youth crime. In the longer term, the Children Bill, 1999, provides for the development of a new juvenile justice system and contains many innovative measures for dealing with young offenders. The Bill merits a great deal of consideration and the focus on preventative measures and support structures for young people in trouble and for their families is to be welcomed. I welcome the Minister's announcement of resources to ensure the proper implementation of all aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the period 1999 to 2001, the Exchequer will contribute £34.8 million towards the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, which was set up in 1998 by the Government. These funds are channelled through a number of Government Departments. In addition, the corporate sector will make a significant contribution to the fund. This fund develops youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas. In April, 1999, the Government allocated more than £25 million of the total amount to support 295 facilities and services projects in 13 local drugs task force areas. More than 60 youth workers, Outreach and sport workers are employed on the ground providing a wide variety of developmental activities and educational programmes for young people at risk in these task force areas. It is only now a variety of these projects are coming to fruition. The Darndale village project in Deputy Broughan's constituency took a long time. Its slow development is no credit to anyone. However, it is happening and it will be good for the general Darndale/Priorswood area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin north east task force area 27 projects are under way. Funding amounting to £1.735 million has been approved in principle for this area for a range of facilities, services and grants. More than £800,000 has been earmarked for the <Col N="517" /> construction and renovation of local youth and community facilities. I take on board Deputy Broughan's criticism on the tardy response of the youth services board in responding to the demands of that area. We will learn and, as a member of the board, I want to contribute as best I can to ensure Darndale, Bonnybrook, Finglas and elsewhere get the services they deserve. Just over £100,000 has been set aside to support locally-based sport and youth groups with equipment and basic programme costs to provide activities and programmes for the target group of persons at risk. I concur with Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks about the soccer academy. There is intervention similar to this in my area and I admire greatly people who run the football club from the boot of their car, sell lottery tickets in the local pubs and do their best to keep the cost of running programmes to a minimum. I have said to the Minister and to others that I am very critical of the way these groups do not benefit in the way they should from the significant funding which is available. Deputy Broughan will recall a meeting of the urban board recently and the laughable situation where money had to be returned to the fund because it could not be spent under the various local development headings. This would have been imminently suitable as a means of funding local groups. Grants of more than £40,000 have been approved in the north east task force area towards the cost of equipment for local youth clubs, sports clubs and women's groups.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science also provides further resources in the Dublin area. It provides financial assistance through the Dublin Youth Service Board for projects such as the Ballymun Youth Action Project, Finglas Youth Development Project, Ballymun Youth Provision, Bonnybrook Youth Project, Donnycarney Youth Project and Priorswood Youth Service. The locally-based youth projects in disadvantaged areas are beginning to have an effect. It is only now they have a guarantee of funding. Up until recently, each project got year-on-year funding and never knew until it was almost too late whether the project would be rolled over. One could not expect project staff to have a great commitment to projects which were on such a short-term contract. This has been remedied and, barring accident, there should be a significant improvement in the projects' development. The City of Dublin Youth Service Board receives an annual grant of in excess of £647,000 to operate a local youth grant scheme in its region and a further £26,555 per annum towards the cost of Foroige's North Dublin youth development officer.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has given a high priority to the diversion of young people who are at risk of becoming involved in crimes such as joyriding and has invested considerable resources in a network of Garda special projects. I recommend them as extremely significant initiatives in the <Col N="518" /> whole youth work area. During the lifetime of the Government the number of Garda special projects has risen from 12 to 29 and there are a number of proposals for other projects before his Department. The projects are tangible crime prevention measures and are run in conjunction with youth organisations. On the question of putting the crime diversion projects on a statutory footing, it should be borne in mind that they are essentially youth interventions. I would be worried that some of the trappings of a statutory service might accrue to some of those projects. Those to which I have referred operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and there is no weekend service.</P>
    <P>The Garda also operates such initiatives as the Garda schools programme and the juvenile diversion programme. Many gardaí are involved in ongoing initiatives to ensure youths in the region get the opportunity to pursue activities which divert them from activities associated with crime and drugs. I pay tribute to our chief superintendent, John McLoughlin, based in Blanchardstown, who spent many years in the core youth club in Crumlin. He still has a great commitment to youth work and if he had his way he would have every Garda doing youth work. There is much to be said for that.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the damage, both mental and physical, that joyriding inflicts on community life. Many Members will be aware that my constituency is notorious in that regard. On St. Patrick's Day this year, as on St. Patrick's Day for the past number of years, there was a significant outbreak of anti-social joyriding company car related activity. On St. Patrick's Day this year over 100 youngsters put every Garda in the Finglas, Blanchardstown and Cabra areas to the pin of their collars by driving a number of cars around the fields and streets of the area and eventually burning them. That was not the end of it. With another public representative, I was called out on Saturday afternoon to look at the scene of depredation caused by a gang of 40 youths who got drunk at about 4 p.m. on Friday last. They stole two cars and had another company car. They rammed the gates of a small neighbourhood park, mowed down the trees which had been planted by Dublin Corporation about ten days previously and burned the three cars adjacent to houses. People telephoned me to say they could not get to bed, not to mention sleep, until 5 a.m. on Saturday. Women and men were traumatised and cried as a result of that vicious thuggery. I hope the juvenile justice aspects of the Children Bill can address that issue. The result of all this is the diversion of a huge amount of resources that could be used elsewhere, in cleaning up after them. I pay credit to Paul Rainsford, head of the abandoned vehicles section of Dublin Corporation and his staff, Dave Kenny, the regional manager in Finglas, Inspector Mal Geraghty of the Garda Síochána and his team, who were out in the fields at 6 a.m. on Monday pulling cars out of ditches, putting them on to lorries and taking <Col N="519" /> them away and trenching fields so that they would not be used as a scrambling track by youngsters. Most of those fields are in the administrative area of Fingal County Council. There is a need for more co-operation between adjacent local authorities. This morning on my way to a meeting of the local drugs task force I drove by another stolen car overturned in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I understand that the number of offences involving under 18 year olds has increased from 1,210 in 1996 to 1,362 in 1998 and that these figures include unauthorised taking, being a passenger in a stolen vehicle and interference with vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána say that where necessary, special uniformed foot and mobile patrols have been implemented to address the issue of anti-social behaviour by youths and so-called joyriding. Deputy Shortall and I are members of a crime task force in Finglas working closely with the Garda and the officials of Dublin Corporation. That is beginning to have an effect. Issues that need to be addressed include better co-operation between the Garda and local authorities and a more flexible approach to dealing with abandoned and burned out cars at weekends. Last weekend we were unable to get anybody to take away the burned out cars referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>There has been an upsurge in the sale of cars to youngsters since January. I call on the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the garages to ensure the end of life form is filled in when disposing of a car. Some time ago a car was traded in to a reputable garage in the city. A car dismantler bought the car, towed it out to a dismantler's yard where it was sold off for about £50 to a group of youngsters in my constituency, driven around and eventually burned. That incident is replicated over and over again and that practice must stop. I appeal to the SIMI to do something about it.</P>
    <P>It is important to deal with car dismantlers. Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited, Pigeon House Road, Dublin, provides an excellent service. Anybody who wants to dispose of an old car can drive it there and it will be taken in. Dublin Corporation also take away old cars. Unfortunately, not every dismantler operates as professionally as Hammond Lane. There are many roadside car dismantling operations along the north fringe of the city. Something must be put in place to ensure these cars are recycled more quickly by the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>A special resource unit comprising one sergeant and eight gardaí was established to specifically target incidents of joyriding in west Tallaght. In Finglas, the<i> Fan</i> project has been very effective. We must convince those disposing of cars that they have a responsibility to dispose of them in a proper fashion. It cannot be right to leave one's car at the side of the road in the hope that somebody surreptitiously arrives and takes it away or offers one £25 for it and it ends up being burned in a field.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Broughan for introducing <Col N="520" /> the Bill. It will provoke a good debate. I ask the Minister to look at section 54 of the Children Bill which states:</P>
    <P>Where a child under the age of 14 years is responsible for an act or omission which, but for <i>section </i>52, would constitute an offence, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the child in or in relation to that act or omission shall be guilty of that offence and be liable to be indicted, tried and punished as a principal offender.</P>
    <P>Could that section be used to prosecute the youngsters who drive uninsured, unlicensed and untaxed cars?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I will share my time with Deputy Coveney.</P>
      <P>I have considerable respect for Deputy Carey and for the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace but having listened to their depressing contributions, I come to the conclusion that the Government has no strategy to deal with the problem of joyriding in urban areas. It did not address the kernel of the issue in Deputy Broughan's Bill. I congratulate Deputy Broughan. The Fine Gael party supports the Bill and will vote in favour of it tomorrow evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State argued that the prohibition of supply would be difficult to implement. He said the Bill does not address the question of supply which may be more appropriate for inclusion in legislation relating to the supply of goods. There are other examples of the restriction of supply. If the Minister of State feels legislation to restrict supply is necessary, let him bring it forward. The Minister of State's second argument against Deputy Broughan's Bill is that it would be necessary to prove that a person who organised, directed or participated in taking a mechanically propelled vehicle did so for the purpose of that vehicle being driven in a dangerous manner. We already have bail legislation which makes a presumption that future behaviour will follow the pattern of previous behaviour. Bail can be refused to people who have previous convictions.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Bill which proposes stringent new powers to deal with the problem of joyriding which is now a cause of considerable distress to communities in urban Ireland. At the very least, the Government should accept this Bill on Second Stage and refer the matter to the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is important in three respects. First, the introduction of this legislation will send out a positive signal to working class communities that Dáil Éireann is concerned about the upsurge of the problems of anti-social activity and joyriding, particularly in recent years. It is not acceptable that a large percentage of residents can be terrorised in their homes by this problem. The current law surrounding driving offences is unable to deal with the scale of the problem which is regularly inflicted on communities from joyriding. In <Col N="521" /> accepting the Bill, the Government can show a commitment to and an interest in some of the most marginalised communities in the country. Too many people in working class housing estates have become disillusioned and disinterested in politics. Acceptance of this Bill can help them to see the importance of politics and the relevance of parliament to their lives.</P>
    <P>Second, the Bill will help the current discussion on road safety. I find it difficult to understand why the Government has not responded to the current upsurge in joyriding. The Road to Safety strategy document announced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in 1998 does not refer to the issue. This Bill is a logical amendment to the Road to Safety strategy document which was outlined in 1998.</P>
    <P>Third, the Bill proposes to put into law a new range of driving offences in connection with supplying or offering vehicles to under age drivers. The Bill recognises that there are malevolent individuals and groups who are systematically selling cars to minors for as little as £10 or £20 per vehicle. This group of criminals knowingly sells vehicles to minors and it is clear that they are virtually untouchable under existing law.</P>
    <P>I challenge the notion that there is an inevitable link between living in a local authority housing estate and anti-social activity. There is no such inevitability, despite the very negative reporting on working class estates by some of our media. The vast majority of people in areas of disadvantage do not allow their children to become engaged in what is euphemistically called joyriding; they are frightened to go to bed every evening because of the scourge of stolen cars racing down their roads at unimaginable speeds; they have to put up with an environment where every day burnt out cars and other vehicles are left strewn on public open spaces; they have known children and adults who have become hospitalised or worse as a result of the scourge of joyriding. This is the reality for the vast majority of people who live in some our local authority estates.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to intervene in an effort to improve the quality of life for people who are suffering from this nightmare. There is a widespread acceptance that the current law is not working. It is crucial that we redefine responsibility in relation to those who are supplying or offering vehicles to under age drivers. It is equally important that the various local agencies who have part responsibility for this problem begin to work in a co-ordinated way to help us stamp it out. Relevant local authorities, the Garda Síochána, residents' associations, health boards and the education authorities need to come together to draw up local strategies so that the demand side of this equation is reduced. In South Dublin the local authority has invited all interested parties in the area to draw up a local intervention plan. There is a need to develop diversion programmes for young people who engage in joy riding and to provide facilities for communities which have been ravaged by the problems of drugs and crime, <Col N="522" /> but there is also a need for those who are charged with the responsibility of policing such communities to redirect their resources and energies so that offenders are apprehended. The problem of joyriding can only be solved where there is a systematic police campaign involving special patrols of the areas worst affected by the problem. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform takes the opportunity in his contribution to this debate tomorrow evening to inform the House of specific measures which the Garda Síochána is proposing to take to combat joyriding. I will be particularly interested to know from the Minister the success rate of plans implemented by the Garda in 1998 to reverse the rise in unauthorised taking of vehicles.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the proposal from some speakers that the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Exclusion and Drugs look at this area and draw up a plan to deal with the problem. It can be dealt with in the way we dealt with the problem of wandering horses in local authority housing estates. If we apply our minds to the problem it can be solved, once and for all. We should abandon our fatalistic approach to problems like this.</P>
    <P>Garda stations which have a high rate of reports of joyriding should receive the support required to combat the problem. There is an unfortunate perception that because joyriding is contained within certain housing estates the authorities frequently turn a blind eye to calls for help from such areas. This is the perception and all of us have a responsibility to change that perception by introducing new measures which tackle the joyriding problem head on. This Bill is one of those measures.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new car test has provided an unprecedented number of vehicles in which children can joyride. Every day in my constituency I count at least 10 or 15 burnt out cars, left on the side of the road or on a public open space. I have been reliably informed that some people are, for a tiny cost, selling cars which are later found in a burnt out condition. A solution to the problem requires a carrot and stick approach. This Bill is a welcome stick. I congratulate its proposers, particularly Deputy Broughan, and I urge the Government to think again before tomorrow evening so that a positive signal can be sent to these communities. The Government, by voting down this measure will send out all the wrong signals to the communities worst affected by the scourge of joyriding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Labour Party and particularly Deputy Broughan, for bringing this Bill before the House. Joyriding is something that every Member of the House wishes to see dealt with in a comprehensive manner through whatever legislation is required. It is unusual that a Bill is brought before the House which deals so specifically with one area but the serious problem and dangers of joyriding justifies our full and immediate attention. As Deputy Hayes said, it is <Col N="523" /> vitally important that a positive message is sent tomorrow night to inner city areas that the problem of joyriding is being taken seriously.</P>
      <P>The Bill is short, specific and straightforward. The explanatory memorandum is only one page long. The purpose of the Bill is to create two new driving offences, the first of which is the supply of vehicles to under age drivers for use in a public place. In other words, it seeks to cut off the supply of old cars to young potential joyriders. The same philosopy was followed in a recent Fine Gael Private Members' motion on cigarettes, which was accepted, aimed at cutting off the supply of cigarettes to persons under the age of 18 years by imposing severe penalties on suppliers.</P>
      <P>While this measure would help to prevent joyriding by making it more difficult to acquire cars, it would be far from being a cure or from being the total solution needed. The Labour Party would not suggest that it is either of these. Let us not fool ourselves about that but if it would help to reduce the incidence of joyriding it is worthy of serious consideration and acceptance.</P>
      <P>The second offence provided for in the Bill is organising, directing and participation in unlawfully taking a car for the purposes of dangerous driving in a public place. The Bill seeks to outlaw joyriding directly and put in place a law to deal with ringleaders under which a severe fine or prison term or both would be imposed on offenders. It would therefore act as a deterrent to potential joyriders and repeat offenders and inflict punishment on those who offend. These severe measures are worthy of serious consideration if they would help to reduce the numbers participating in joyriding.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome in that it places the issue of joyriding centre stage. To deal comprehensively with what is largely an inner city problem, much more needs to be done. Deputy Broughan is not claiming to have the complete solution. The effects of joyriding on a community can vary. Normally a neighbourhood, park or housing estate is terrorised. Residents are literally imprisoned in their homes, afraid to come out as teenagers race around out of control in old cars, making an unmerciful noise, often in the early hours of the morning, with the revving of engines and the screeching of rubber on the road surface.</P>
      <P>The devastation that joyriding can cause is only fully realised when there is loss of life. In Cork, north and south of the River Lee, we have had the bitter taste of tragedy that joyriding can inflict. In 1998 two young men, Christopher Kearney and Ian Ward, died when their stolen car went out of control and hit a pole. In March 1999 Trevor O'Connell and Stephen Kirby were hit by a stolen car and killed. The city came to a standstill in grief with their families. I can remember it clearly. If that was not enough in May 1999 Mrs. Atkins, a married mother of three, was knocked down and killed by the driver of a stolen car which mounted the pavement as she walked home from a party with her husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> In 1998 more than 900 cars were stolen in the greater Cork area, many by teenagers. The figure for Dublin is 7,000 annually. In the past three years there have been eight deaths in Cork alone as a direct result of joyriding. Dublin and Limerick have had more than their fair share of tragedy. A car or vehicle in the hands of someone who cannot control it or who is out of control, as is often the case, is a lethal weapon.</P>
    <P>When I think of joyriding and try to find ways of eradicating this behaviour, I clearly remember listening to a 16 year old being interviewed on the subject of car stealing and joyriding following the third tragic death in Cork to which I referred. When asked why he did it he described it as a drug, something to which he had become addicted &ndash; the excitement, speed, peer pressure and, most of all, the dare. In many instances these feelings are intensified by the use of recreational drugs and alcohol. In cutting off easy access to cars or increasing the penalties for joyriding we would not solve the problem but we may reduce it. That is where we must start.</P>
    <P>In examining and eliminating the causes of joyriding, what is required is a multi-agency, multi-departmental approach. Young teenagers must be provided with stimulation and challenges to ensure their energy is channelled positively. It is no coincidence that inner city areas which are underprovided for in terms of recreational facilities and other resources are black spot areas. It is no coincidence either that many of the other anti-social behavioural problems with which we are trying to deal, not least drug abuse, are hugely prevalent in these areas.</P>
    <P>One in five children leave school at the age of 15 or 16 years on completion of the junior certificate. The education system has failed these young people. Education is the key to early intervention for young people with the potential to engage in anti-social behaviour. There is a clear link between early school-leavers and those who fall by the wayside. The gap between the wealthy and the well educated and the poor is widening, a matter which the Department of Education and Science must address.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must play its part by dealing with juvenile crime comprehensively. The advances made in the Children Bill are welcome. The alternatives to imprisonment are long overdue, particularly for juveniles. The Department of Sport, Tourism and Recreation must provide facilities. It is not enough to provide green areas in the middle of housing estates, they must be developed. The Department of Health and Children must play its part in eradicating the problem by addressing the problems of drug and alcohol abuse and examining the reasons for bad behaviour, which are sometimes medical and passed on from parents to children.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to communities which are being terrorised by groups of young people involved in joyriding. While we must adopt a hardline approach and punish the ringleaders, we <Col N="525" /> must also try to lead potential joyriders away from a life of crime and misery. The Government should reconsider how it will vote tomorrow night. It is vitally important that those who are affected by the scourge of joyriding believe we are trying to do something positive for them. I urge the Minister to accept the two positive measures provided for in this small Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this important and serious matter. We have a significant coastal erosion problem &ndash; a study a number of years ago by the City and County Managers Association estimated some 1,500 kms to be at risk with 490 kms needing immediate attention. The area of Bray harbour was included in that. In his efforts to address the problem the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources sanctioned work on the Bray coastal protection scheme. This commenced in 1998. Phase one consisted of the construction of a breakwater and groyne and was completed last year. The present phase comprises repairs to the harbour wall. These started in 1999 and should be completed this year. The work involves the removal of obstructions on the seabed, driving permanent steel piles and constructing a new concrete wall encasing the piles over a length of approximately 100 meters. In addition, a concrete deck slab will be constructed over the entire 240 meters of the existing south pier. The cost of the works is estimated at £1 million.</P>
      <P>On Monday last, a barge which had been used to assist in the works and owned by Ascon, the civil engineering company, drifted from its base at the south pier in Bray harbour when three of the six steel cables securing it gave way. For a while, due to the fact that the barge was holding 7,500 tons of diesel, there was concern that a serious environmental accident could take place. Thankfully, due to the good work of many bodies, this threat has been averted and it now appears that 95% of the oil has been offloaded. A tug, the <i>Vanguard</i>, has made efforts to bring the barge to Dublin Port. However, its first attempt failed and I believe it will renew its efforts tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been raised and I ask the Minister if he is satisfied with the safety precautions taken by this contractor. Has a similar incident occurred with this contract? What measures has the Department taken to ensure they will not recur? Was it necessary for the barge to contain this quantity of diesel? What is the maximum amount it has contained? Has the Minister any plans to address this? Is he satisfied that the barge can be removed? What impact will this incident have on the project? It is important that the Minister clarify these matters as soon as possible. <Col N="526" /> What method, if any, has his Department in place to monitor such contracts? If there is not any, what plans are there to implement same?</P>

      <P>&mdash;3 April 2000, Ascon advised the coastguard that the barge which it was using in the construction work at Bray harbour had broken adrift and damaged itself. The coast guard was advised that the barge had 35,000 litres of diesel oil on board and was unmanned.</P>
      <P>The coastguard tasked its Dublin helicopter to carry out an aerial survey to check whether diesel oil was leaking from the barge. The Greystones coast guard unit was also tasked to assess the area from the shore and the Bray harbour master was advised. The aerial survey indicated at 09.15 hours that no leakage was occurring but that it would be dangerous to put people on board to attempt to stabilise the position. At this time, the barge was subjected to a heavy pounding by the sea and it was neither possible to winch people onto it by helicopter nor to gain access from the shore. Bray UDC was advised of the position.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the 35,000 litres of diesel oil presented a significant risk of pollution, the following action was taken. The coast guard dispatched the incident manager to take charge of on scene management at 09.50 hours, its marine pollution response team was activated as a prudent precautionary measure, two surveyors from the Department's marine survey office were winched onto the barge at 11.27 hours when tidal conditions allowed for this to be done safely, 12,000 litres of diesel oil were offloaded into road tankers by 21.41 hours, leaving 23,000 tons and the barge was subsequently secured for the night.</P>
      <P>At 06.00 hours today the tug <i>Voyager</i> from Holyhead arrived on the scene. By 09.30 hours, 31,000 litres of oil were removed. At 11.55 hours, with the aid of the coast guard helicopter from Dublin, the securing of the tug to the barge commenced. At 13.06 hours the line from the barge parted and the towing winch on the tug <i>Vanguard</i> failed. The tug returned to Dublin to repair the winch and the barge was re-secured. The barge is damaged on the port side and will require repairs.</P>
      <P>The next attempt to refloat the barge will be on tomorrow morning's tide. The marine surveyors and coast guard personnel will remain on scene. Four thousand litres of oil remain on the barge which is still aground. While there remains a risk of pollution, this is greatly reduced and is being managed on scene. A surveyor from the marine survey office has been appointed under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to carry out a full investigation into this incident and to report to me on his findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The works being carried out at Bray by Ascon is part of the on-going coastal protection work which is designed to protect the historic sea front <Col N="527" /> at Bray and is being undertaken in three phases. Throughout the operation, full co-operation was given to my officials by Ascon.</P>
    <P>I thank my officials, volunteers and the Dublin coast guard helicopter for their work in managing this difficult incident and in reducing the risk of pollution. I wish all involved well tomorrow in the further attempt to refloat the barge. While the risk of pollution is greatly reduced, I assure the House that we will do all we can to avoid any pollution in Bray harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The structure of the Adjournment Debate is not satisfactory in that prepared scripts do not deal with questions raised by Opposition Deputies. I have tried over the years to have the structure changed so that the Minister of the day would be able to answer questions at the end which would make the debate more relevant.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter. It arises from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday, 1 April, April fool's day, with the headline &ldquo;Archives unharmed after roof collapses. Priceless collection is stored in decaying house&rdquo;. The article and its headline may be slightly misleading but it gives an opportunity to present the way the State treats and is interested in housing archive material of great importance to the people and the nation.</P>
      <P>This complex in the Phoenix Park is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works and I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is present. The place names branch is housed in Mountjoy House and the other elements of the complex house the Ordnance Survey. It was built in the early 1720s and is now a series of buildings but the Office of Public works does not appear to have any long-term strategy for its use. There are a number of questions I would like the Minister of State to answer. If he is not in a position to do so now I would be grateful if he would forward replies to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The placenames commission is housed in a section of this complex and comprises four researchers and one clerical officer. The Ordnance Survey personnel moved out of that section last year. There were eight original fireplaces stolen from the building last year. I understand this could only have been done on the instruction of someone who had knowledge of fireplaces as those left behind were not the originals. There was a camera pointing at the gate and the Minister of State might confirm whether there was film in it. The floor of the building was in such a condition that the original Ordnance Survey volumes of 1830, with a volume for every county, was taken out to another building, which is described as a former army canteen, with no thermostatic controls. It is a priceless series of volumes that cannot be replaced. It is not in a suitable location. There is not any fax machine in the <Col N="528" /> building. The staff cannot send e-mail. They must walk 200 yards if they want to send a fax.</P>
    <P>I understand that an examination of the building has been carried out and there is no clear evidence of where the collapse occurred. I am not sure whether the writer of this article visited the buildings. I did not visit them but it has been reported to me that a substantial amount of plaster was seen on the floors of some of the buildings indicating a collapse, although it may not have been in this particular section of the placenames branch. It may have been another section; perhaps the Minister could confirm the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an interest in this matter and I want him to set out a clear strategy for the future housing of the placenames commission, the researchers, the clerical staff and the material which cannot be replaced and which, according to a Forbairt report in 1994 &ndash; the Office of Public Works has known about this since then &ndash; is in danger of going on fire as a result of an electrical fault and is not in the best condition in terms of temperature, dampness, dryness, etc. I assume the Minister has the resources to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has displayed an interest in this matter and I want him to sort it out in the next couple of months. I ask him to find a suitable location for the personnel and the material. The shifting around of this priceless material from room to room is an indication of the way our past is being treated. There is no thermostatic control and there are national headlines stating that sections of the building where the archives are stored have collapsed. It is indicative of what is happening in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy de Valera. This is not the only issue which has collapsed recently.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond to my queries and put the minds of the people concerned at ease. I ask the Minister to deal with the issues of the fireplaces, the camera, the roof collapse, the shifting around of material, thermostatic control and the longer term future of the building complex. In addition, I ask him to outline his views on where the archival material of the placenames branch will be stored and where the personnel will work in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be glad to learn that contrary to media reports, there was no collapse of any portion of the roof of Mountjoy House. I sent out officials today to ensure we were correct and the position has been confirmed to me. However, I do not dismiss the various points made by the Deputy. I have a great interest in the State property directly under my control. The Deputy as a <Col N="529" /> former Minister also had a great interest in the general area. Part of my difficulty at times is that other Departments have direct responsibility for certain matters. However, extensive programmes in areas where I have direct responsibility have been highly commended. The quality of the work being done by the officials is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised some specific questions. I do not have the answers with me but I am glad he raised them. He will get a specific and direct response from me as soon as I get the answers to the questions he raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter which will allow the Minister to put on record his thinking in this area. I hope the Whips can arrange statements on this matter in the near future. Many Deputies would like to comment and support the Minister's efforts to ensure proper funding is provided for Irish horse racing. A broader debate on this matter is required at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>The horseracing industry does not only involve sport. It directly and indirectly employs tens of thousands of people. It is one of our great natural resources and assets and anything that can be done to advance the horseracing industry should be supported by all Members of the House. In that context, I welcome the proposals of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to put the funding of the horse-racing industry on a more sound footing. They will ensure that the whims of the Minister for Finance of the day will not matter and that there will be proper planning and development.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, many problems still affect the horse racing industry. People who only read about Cheltenham and Aintree and see big crowds at the Curragh might think everything is rosy in the garden. However, there are many problems with regard to attendances, facilities, prize money and the age profile of people involved in the industry. All these matters must be addressed, but that cannot be done without a firm financial basis. The proposals of the Minister and the Minister for Finance to give guaranteed funding to the horse racing industry must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister respond to the concerns of people that the income from betting taxes will not be as substantial in the future if off-shore, Internet and other fancy forms of off-course betting become the norm? What will be the position at that stage? It appears laudable and welcome to guarantee the horseracing industry that it will receive the entire betting revenue. This involves a large amount at present but what is the Minister's response to people who warn that, in the future, the money available from the betting industry will be significantly reduced and that an increasing <Col N="530" /> number of punters will bet off-shore? What guarantees can be given to the horseracing industry at that stage?</P>
    <P>The various agencies which run horseracing at present, which include the Irish Horseracing Authority, the Turf Club and The Association of Irish Racecourses, all have their positions on the Minister's proposal. The fact that several agencies are running horse racing is an example of the current problem. One cannot have three masters. An industry as big as the horseracing industry needs a single guiding star. Traditions die hard and it is difficult for people who held positions of influence and power and used them properly and effectively to accept that somebody else may take over. However, changes are necessary. We cannot rest on our laurels and the problems would be best addressed by a single agency as proposed. Many of the queries from the Turf Club and The Association of Irish Racecourses are genuine and need to be answered.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response. What is the timescale for the proposals? The Minister for Finance promised money but we all know he is a man of independent thinking. If progress is not seen to take place as quickly as he would wish, he might reflect on the situation. Will the Minister outline how long the offer will remain on the table? Will he shed some light on why there appears to be growing opposition to his proposals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for raising this matter in a constructive way. He made the point that racing is more than just a game. It is an industry which employs approximately 25,000 people and contributes to the tourism industry and the culture of being Irish. It is no longer a case of a few non-residents having horses in training in Ireland. Members of the House can claim to have some interest in the industry. One needs to win approximately four races each year to keep a fairly moderate horse in training. Therefore, there is a need for reasonable prize money. One must also pay for the day out and the bottle of champagne, etc.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990s, we established the Irish Horseracing Authority to provide the industry with a new impetus. During the term of office of my predecessor, Deputy Yates, the industry also developed. In the past decade approximately £60 million has been invested in upgrading facilities throughout the country. As a result, we now have good tracks, stadia and restaurant facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of months ago, the Minister for Finance indicated that, if a more streamlined structure was put in place, he would be prepared to place the industry on a secure footing in terms of funding by attaching it to off-course betting in the future. He invited the Turf Club and the IHA to develop a response to his proposal and since then discussions have taken place among the various interested parties. Members of the media have been trying to be as destructive as possible in <Col N="531" /> respect of this matter and have been using inflammatory language, including words such as &ldquo;take-over&rdquo;, &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo;, etc. That is not the way it is supposed to work. People involved in the industry must reach a consensus on the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is very important that a consensus is reached because in the 1980s the horseracing industry was stagnant and even in decline because other leisure activities were becoming more popular. Now, however, attendances are on the increase and 1.3 million people attend race meetings in Ireland each year. We have an outstanding breeding industry. There are more group and multiple group one stallions and classic winners standing in Ireland than in any other country. We have the best bloodlines in the world and we are in good shape. However, as Deputy Bradford stated, we cannot rest on our laurels. We must keep ahead of the competition and ensure that Irish racing remains on a par with international standards.</P>
    <P>Talks on the issue have taken place between the IHA, the Turf Club, the Association of Irish Racecourses, on-course bookmakers, trainers, owners and breeders and, while progress has been slow, I am confident that firm and progressive proposals will emerge in the near future. Discussions on the subject are continuing with the various organisations and the IHA. At a board meeting yesterday, the IHA reaffirmed its commitment to my initiative in this area. I am assured that a satisfactory outcome, which will be to the long-term benefit of the industry, will be achieved. I ask that these proposals be considered in a constructive spirit and that the interdependence between the different elements of the industry be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford asked two question, the first of which involved Internet betting. We should not be concerned about this matter. Irish people are and will continue to be great punters. Last year, for example, they punted £700 million in high street betting shops and that figure will probably rise to £1 billion this year. At the same time, on-course betting increased to approximately £133 million. That trend will continue. It would be great to have a percentage of this money index-linked in order that it could be re-invested directly into the industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the time scale and the vagaries of my colleague, namely, that his enthusiasm in respect of this matter might sour, we would like the industry to develop firm proposals in time for this year's Estimates. As Members are aware, the debate on the Estimates will take place after Easter and they will begin to take effect in September. It would be desirable if the industry could arrive at an ami<Col N="532" /> cable solution based on consensus at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Senior medical personnel throughout the country are issuing serious warnings that vital hospital services in a wide range of medical specialities could be seriously curtailed if hospitals cannot attract the necessary number of junior doctors as vacancies arise. Because of the problems experienced by junior doctors, such as long hours and inadequate training, a serious situation is arising whereby hospitals are finding it difficult to obtain a response to advertisements inviting applications for junior hospital doctor posts. In some cases, there were not any applications. A crisis will arise in July when many of these posts become vacant. For that reason, the Minister for Health and Children must address the justifiable grievances of junior hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>A serious situation is becoming even worse because rigorous immigration procedures are adding to the crisis. A number of non-EU doctors currently working our hospitals have claimed that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's immigration rules are preventing them from bringing their spouses and families into this country. They have warned that this policy will discourage non-EU doctors from accepting hospital posts here. In the face of an increasing shortage of junior hospital doctors, the IMO has stated that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's attitude will lead to a worsening of the position. That organisation has already supported a number of junior doctors in their dealings with the Department in question.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with a doctor working in a Dublin hospital and another working in a hospital in Cork whose applications to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring their families into this country have been rejected. They are well qualified people who entered Ireland in a legal way and they are providing a very valuable service. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's guidelines for overseas workers state that spouses must wait one year before they can apply for visas. However, each case should be taken on its merits. Doctors working in vital positions in our health services where crises may occur should be offered a degree of flexibility by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Furthermore, the Minister for Health and Children should work in a co-ordinated way with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to investigate serious allegations made by a non-EU doctor against the medical council. The individual <Col N="533" /> in question, having completed his basic surgical training in Pakistan passed his surgical fellowship from two royal colleges a year ago and applied for registration with the general medical council in the UK as well as the Medical Council of Ireland on the basis of his higher surgical diplomas, received an application from the GMC in the UK stating that he could apply for a training course post and when offered it, could have his registration within five working days. He was not asked to pay any fees or provide any additional documents, other than those relating to his medical qualifications.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Medical Council of Ireland asked him for a £400 fee which was non-refundable before it would process his application and sought many other documents. He then had to wait a month before a decision was reached on his application. At that stage he was informed that it had been rejected on the grounds that his diploma had not been conferred. He was informed that he would have to wait four months before his diploma was conferred by the awarding college. A friend of the man in question, who found himself in similar circumstances, obtained his registration almost immediately. The difference was that the second man was an EU national.</P>
    <P>These are two examples of impediments being placed in the way of doctors trying to enter this country and, in addition to the long working hours and the awful pressures faced by junior doctors, they must be addressed. This matter was raised in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> recently and I hope the Minister can provide answers in respect of it this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for sharing time. I am aware of a doctor who recently obtained employment in Mullingar General Hospital. His wife applied for a visa to enter this country to be with her husband but her application was refused. The man subsequently contacted me and I, in turn, contacted the Minister's office but, on appeal, the visa application was refused. That makes a mockery of Article 41 of the Constitution under which the State guarantees to protect the family as the necessary basis of social order and indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State. The Article proceeds to deal with the role of women in the home and so forth. If this Government is to uphold the Constitution as it should, it cannot act in such a cavalier way in relation to the spouses of people who have entered this country with proper work permits. That is a mockery of the Constitution. It is indicative of the Government's attitude to non-EU nationals and people who seek to work here. It is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to date but perhaps the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources will have better news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that Deputy Allen is one of a number of public representatives who have raised this matter with him in recent weeks and that the Minister has addressed this question in responses to parliamentary questions, including in a response to a question which the Deputy should have received today.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, I am pleased to respond further to the matters raised by both Deputies. At present, the policy applied by the Department is that a person who requires a visa may join a spouse who is in possession of a valid work permit once the worker has become established in the State, usually after 12 months, and is likely to be here for at least a similar period, provided the person is in a position to support his or her family members without recourse to public funds.</P>
      <P>This policy is not new nor does the Minister believe it is unreasonable that a waiting period should apply. It enables a more informed decision to be made regarding the person's prospects in Ireland and, in particular, whether they are likely to become established here. Clearly, the Minister is concerned that were a person's family to join him immediately and he then lost his job or otherwise became a burden on the State, the costs involved would be likely to be higher and the prospect of securing the person's departure lower given that his family would have settled here and formed links.</P>
      <P>The Department applies a similar approach in respect of the visa required by family members of temporary registered doctors. Such doctors do not require a work permit to take up medical appointments here and are generally granted temporary registration by the Irish Medical Council for six months at a time. The Minister is conscious that such doctors are also generally working on contracts of six months' duration. It is conceivable, therefore, that a person might experience difficulties in renewing either his registration or his work contract and that such difficulties would be most likely to come to light in the first 12 months of the person's residence.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not unusual in applying waiting periods of this nature. Many other EU states apply similar or longer waiting periods to all non-EU nationals, not just those from visa required nationalities. The Commission's recent proposal for a directive dealing with family reunification makes specific provision for states to apply a waiting period of up to 12 months before accepting an application for family reunification from a third country national residing in their territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's policy in this field is currently under review. Some exceptions are already made in certain areas of extreme skill shortage, notably the IT sector. Such exceptions are generally made on foot of representations or advice from competent bodies such as the State develop<Col N="535" /> ment agencies, as neither the Minister nor his Department regard themselves as having sufficient specialist knowledge of sectoral labour market conditions to draw conclusions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the question of skills and labour needs in the health sector is not one on which the Minister believes he can make informed comment. However, his Department has not received representations from the Department of Health and Children in so far as facilitating temporary registered doctors is concerned.</P>

The Department's policy applies to a range of different professions and the Minister must take into account the implications for all categories of applications. He must also devise a policy which will be sustainable in labour market conditions which are less buoyant than those which fortunately apply today.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the projected drop in beef prices as a consequence of the current round of world trade talks in view of the fact that a report (details supplied) stated that the last round of talks resulted in a drop in the price being paid to beef producers and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9671/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): The report in question identified a number of factors which led to a reduction in cattle prices in Ireland between 1992 and 1999. These factors included the 1992 CAP reform, the 1995 WTO agreement, the 1996 BSE crisis and the change in the composition of steers slaughtered in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I accept that these are the major factors involved in the determination of cattle prices in Ireland in the 1990s, although I would also add to these the Russian crisis in 1998. While it is not possible to isolate the specific importance of any single factor, the 1995 WTO agreement was not a major determinant of cattle prices in the period. Cattle prices in Ireland fell by 18% between 1992-99. This reduction is not significantly in excess of the 15% reduction programmed under the 1992 reform which predated the 1995 WTO Agreement and which ensured that agreement would have little impact on the EU market over and above that of the reform itself. I point out that cattle producers were compensated for the fall in prices by substantial increases in premia. For example, the average premium payable on steers was worth 38p a pound in 1999 compared to 4.5p a pound in 1992. In 1999, the premium, together with the market price, resulted in an overall return of approximately 119p a pound to producers of steer cattle compared to a corresponding return of 104p a pound in 1992. This represented an increase of 14% in overall returns to cattle producers between 1992 and 1999.</P>
    <P>The 1996 BSE crisis and the subsequent renationalisation of the EU market, which increased the dependence of the Irish beef industry on third country markets, had a major impact on the Irish beef market, particularly in 1996 and 1997. The Russian crisis in the second half of 1998 reversed the recovery in prices recorded in the first half of that year and was substantially responsible for the low prices in 1999.</P>
    <P>As far as the WTO agreement is concerned, the ceiling on subsidised beef exports was not reached in any of the years since 1995 and the reduction in export refunds since then was linked more to conditions on the market, including the dollar/euro exchange rate, than to the WTO Agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the next WTO agreement the negotiations have only commenced and will not <Col N="538" /> be finalised for some time. In the absence of any indication of the eventual outcome of these negotiations, it is not possible to give any estimate of its likely impact on cattle prices. However, as in the case of the 1995 WTO agreement, the Agenda 2000 reform of the beef regime should help to limit its impact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The organic farming sector is a fast-developing one and is reacting to the demands for produce produced in an environmentally friendly fashion. I expect the demand for organic foods will continue to grow and I believe that this will lead to an increased awareness of the market potential for these products in the retail sector.</P>
      <P>My Department liaises with Bord Bia and An Bord Glas in developing the market potential of the organic sector. As recently as 14 March, Bord Glas hosted a major conference for the organic sector at which keynote speakers from both the public and private sectors delivered papers identifying the growth potential at production and market level. Bord Bia, which carries out ongoing work in relation to surveying, investigating and developing markets and potential markets for food, believes that the organic sector has the potential to become a significant niche within the overall food market.</P>
      <P>Very substantial work is also being done by Teagasc which will contribute to the growth and development of the organic sector. A new research project on organic milk production commenced during 1999 at the Teagasc organic unit at Johnstown Castle in County Wexford. This new research project will also address the production of organic cereals to meet the needs for adequate supplies of organic concentrates essential for milk production. The Teagasc research centre at Oakpark, in conjunction with the organic milk production unit, is carrying out research into systems for the production of organic cereals at the organic unit in Johnstown Castle. Further research into organic production is currently being embarked upon by Teagasc at their Athenry facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that the demand for organic produce outstrips supply and I am satisfied that the level of demand in itself will ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector. In addition, however, my Department is providing support for the sector through the provision of funding in the national development plan and in the rural development plan for the period 2000-2006 which is being considered by the European Commission <Col N="539" /> at present. Proposals for a new agri-environmental scheme modelled on the provisions of the current rural environment protection scheme have been included in the rural development plan and these proposals include continuing support for REPS participants who opt to enter organic farming. In addition, Ireland has made a provision of £6 million in the national development plan for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is to build on the work already being done to ensure the integrity of Irish organic produce and to ensure that there are adequate supplies to meet demand. I am confident that, with the benefit of the work being done by Bord Glas, Bord Bia and Teagasc, the continuing supports available through REPS and the proposals for continued funding for the sector which are included in the national development plan, Irish organic producers will be well placed to meet the increasing market demand.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive evaluation of the REP scheme was submitted to the European Commission in July 1999. This evaluation assessed how the objectives of the scheme have been met, examined the agricultural, socio-economic and environmental impact of the REP scheme and provided practical recommendations for future modifications and improvements to the scheme.</P>
      <P>For this exercise, independent consultants were engaged to consider the various inputs to the evaluation process and to put together the comprehensive and objective assessment of REPS. Submissions were received from concerned organisations including the Heritage Council, Birdwatch Ireland, Teagasc and the farming organisations. Independent studies were also commissioned on particular measures of the REP scheme under the auspices of Teagasc and the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in REPS are required to follow a nutrient management plan which identifies pollution control facilities on the farm and ensures the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner and sets limits on application rates of fertilisers. The evaluation report found that nutrient management plans are contributing significantly to the REP scheme objec<Col N="540" /> tive of reducing agriculture's contribution to environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The control of farm pollution scheme was specifically examined by my Department's analysis and evaluation unit, which was set up under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99 &ndash; OPARDF. The examination took place as part of an evaluation of the environmental effects of the OPARDF, which was completed in August 1999.</P>
    <P>The evaluation found that the management of waste and pollution control facilities is of the utmost importance in preventing pollution and as a consequence in protecting the environment. The evaluation also found that the requirement under the national scheme for the control of farm pollution that applicants are obliged to have a nutrient management plan was a welcome move and should help farmers recognise the full fertiliser value of agricultural manures and slurry and realise the importance of good practice in relation to landspreading. This finding together with the other recommendations regarding improved farmyard pollution control are currently being considered by my Department in the context of drafting the terms and conditions of a scheme of farm waste management and a scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards for submission to the European Commission for approval. These schemes are provided for under the agricultural element of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a new scheme of early retirement from farming were submitted to the European Commission in December 1999 as part of my Department's draft rural development plan for the period 2000-2006. The Commission has six months from the date of submission to consider the plan.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present in discussion with the Commission on the contents of the draft plan and is making every effort to expedite these discussions. While it is not possible at this stage to say when the Commission's approval will be received, my objective is to have the new scheme of early retirement in place at the earliest date.</P>

      <P>Since its introduction in 1994, 9,973 farmers have participated in the scheme of early retirement from farming. At present 8,854 of those are active participants. The remainder are largely accounted for by participants who have died and by those who have left the scheme because their period in it has ended. Others have been suspended or have withdrawn. The number of farmers in each county who have participated in the course of the scheme is as follows:</P>

    <P>The reduction of 5.05% in the rate of pension under the scheme was a permanent one resulting from the revaluation of the pound when the euro was introduced in January 1999. The Council of Ministers approved the payment of compensation over three years to participants in the schemes affected by this reduction. Full compensation was approved for losses arising in 1999 and this was paid in January of this year to the majority of those who qualified. A small number of other cases which have to be calculated individually are in the course of payment. Reduced compensation has been approved for 2000 and 2001 and arrangements for payment have yet to be confirmed.</P>

      <P>Proposals were made late last year to the horse racing industry by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to the effect that he would be prepared to examine the existing financial provisions to support racing in the event of the industry agreeing to establish a new single governing structure that would achieve desirable rationalisation, efficiencies and other potential improvements in the overall operation of Irish racing as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and myself are strongly committed to progressing the matter in the context of our wish to provide a long-term sound and secure funding base for the ongoing development of Irish racing. Talks have taken place between the IHA and all the relevant industry bodies, including the Turf Club, the racecourses, the on-course bookmakers, the trainers, owners, breeders, etc, and while progress has been made, I am hopeful that firm proposals will emerge in the near future. As of now discussions on the subject are still ongoing within the various organisations and the IHA.</P>

      <P>The number of students attending the agricultural colleges has declined in recent years. An ERSI study produced for Teagasc last year suggested reasons, including the following, for this decline: declining numbers of farms; declining school leaving population; increased availability of third level educational places; and increased off-farm job opportunities, locally and nationally, for young school leavers from a farming background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again emphasise the importance of agricultural education and training for any young person who intends to take up farming. Continuing technological and economic changes make such train<Col N="544" /> ing essential for a successful career in the demanding world of modern farming.</P>
    <P>I also point out that young trained farmers can avail of significant financial benefits from the State, including stamp duty relief and installation aid. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the stamp duty exemption on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to trained young farmers is being increased to 100%. Trained young farmers also qualify for the transfer of land under the early retirement scheme for farmers.</P>
    <P>Last November, I established a task force to review the training needs of agriculture in the light of the changing social and economic circumstances. The task force will address the issue of declining student numbers and I look forward to receiving its report next month.</P>

      <P>With regard to BSE, my Department operates a comprehensive range of measures, which have been reviewed by the EU Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, for the eradication and control of BSE and will continue to treat this as a top priority, given its importance in terms of public health and consumer confidence in our beef industry at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Regarding tuberculosis, the position is that some 99.6% of the 10.7 million TB tests carried out last year were clear and consequently the impact on our beef industry is not significant though the testing regime is important in order to retain our freedom to trade status. Similarly, the position regarding brucellosis was that some 99.9% of the 5.5 million serological tests carried out in 1999 were clear.</P>
      <P>As regards EBL, monitoring tests of the national herd are undertaken to maintain this country's official freedom from the disease.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report and recommendations of the task force on the beef industry is a blueprint for the development of the beef sector from primary production through to marketing. I have established a monitoring committee under the aegis of Bord Bia to oversee the implementation of a number of these recommendations. The remaining recommendations of the beef task force are, depending on their nature, for implementation by the industry itself and by the relevant State agencies in co-operation with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as primary production is concerned, the major requirement is to improve the quality of cattle through better breeding and husbandry practices in order to ensure an adequate supply of high quality beef needed to meet the demanding requirements of the EU market. Both Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation have intensified their efforts in recent months to promote the development of quality breeding by producers. For example, Teagasc has just completed a series of eight road shows designed to give producers guidance on the ideal heifer replacement <Col N="546" /> essential for the production of quality beef. However, in the final analysis, producers' decisions in this area will be based on the extent to which prices paid by beef processors reward quality production. The beef task force monitoring committee is examining this issue and I am confident that progress will be made in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>At the processing stage, the main issues which need to be addressed are the over capacity in the slaughtering sector and the need to encourage the production of value added products. Under the national development plan, priority will be given to the beef sector at primary slaughtering in the context of the productive sector operational programme. This initiative, operating in partnership with the industry itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way. In addition, under the national development plan, the investment related to the production of value added products will also be encouraged.</P>
    <P>With regard to market promotion, responsibility for beef promotion is a matter for Bord Bia and the industry itself. Substantial resources are available to Bord Bia for that purpose. However, given EU constraints on the promotion of Irish beef on the marketing of product on the basis of the country of origin, the promotion activities of Bord Bia need to be supplemented by an industry funded campaign which is not subject to EU constraints. The introduction of a marketing fund financed at industry level was a major recommendation of the task force and is one of those matters which the monitoring committee has been asked to implement.</P>
    <P>Apart from these issues, a major requirement in the beef industry is to remove the distrust which exists between producers and processors and bring about a greater degree of partnership and co-operation between them. To this end, my Department has been publishing prices paid by individual meat factories since mid-February. The Government has also decided to establish a price transparency mechanism based on independent verification. The latter issue is being progressed in the context of the beef task force monitoring committee. In addition, the Government has engaged an independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the industry and the reasons for the large differentials between producer and consumer prices. The group has been asked to complete its report by the end of April. All these initiatives should help to rebuild the trust and partnership between beef producers and processors needed to enable the industry to achieve its full potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The analysis referred to was prepared by the FAPRI-Ireland Partnership in the context of a medium-term analysis for the agri-food sector. It suggests that farm income will increase by around 16% between now and 2003. This follows a reduction of 12% in 1999. After 2003, FAPRI predicts that income is likely to plateau and, by 2007, aggregate farm income in nominal terms will be similar to 1998 levels. FAPRI suggests that, with an average inflation rate of 3% per year, aggregate income in real terms will be 20% lower in 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Average farm income is calculated by dividing aggregate income by the number of farms. Current trends suggest that there will be a decline in farm numbers, mainly in small farms under 20 hectares, over the period to 2007, so that average farm income in real terms is likely to be similar or higher than in 1998. A report prepared for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last year, based on a previous FAPRI analysis, concluded that real income <Col N="548" /> per farm worker was likely to grow at 3% per annum, or a total of 30%, up to 2007. It should also be borne in mind that at least half of farm household income now comes from off-farm activities. This part of farm household income is likely to continue to grow, as the number of part-time farmers increases in the future.</P>

      <P>The European Commission is currently finalising the Leader+ draft guidelines document, having regard to the observations of the European Parliament which have been accepted by the member states. It is expected that the Commission will shortly issue the approved guidelines. Based on these guidelines, member states will draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. The Commission over a period of some months will subject the programmes to detailed examination to ensure in particular that they show evidence of significant innovation to the requisite standard for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader-type activity in the period 2000-06. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the national Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding of £20 million for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader-type measure. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of <Col N="549" /> arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of the Leader rural development programmes in the period 2000-2006 and I acknowledge that the work effected under Leader I and Leader II has very significantly benefited local communities. Accordingly, every effort is being made to ensure the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures. The timing of this will depend in large measure on the date of securing the necessary approval of the European Commission in respect of the draft operational programmes governing the Leader+ programme and the national Leader programme.</P>
    <P>Groups have been funded to the 30 June 2000 Leader II completion date and I am conscious that a further period will elapse before the coming on-stream of the new Leader measures. Accordingly, I have secured interim funding in respect of the period from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 2000 to assist with the administrative costs of existing groups. Such funding will be made available to groups who submit a plan document outlining their needs in this area. Any funding of existing groups will be without prejudice to the selection of groups for the delivery of the new Leader activity.</P>

      <P>The social butter scheme, which was fully fundable by the EU, was one of a number of measures used to contribute to balance in the EU dairy market. Ireland was the only member state which operated it. The aid level was progressively reduced from year to year and a decision was taken by the EU Agriculture Council in December 1998 to allow the scheme to operate for one final year. The new basic Council regulation governing the EU dairy regime as agreed under agenda 2000 did not provide for this scheme beyond January 2000. There is, therefore, no legal basis for continuing the scheme beyond that date. The cost of the scheme during 1998, the last full year for which information is available, was £2.3 million.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed <Col N="550" /> that the Commission felt it appropriate to reduce export refunds on cattle and beef at the meeting of the beef management committee on 17 March. Ireland argued strongly against such action at the time. However, the higher returns available to Irish beef exporters arising from the strengthening of the dollar against the euro in recent months should more than offset the reduction in export refunds. In view of this, the reduction in refunds should not lead to any reduction in the price available to processors or indeed the price paid to producers for cattle.</P>

      <P>The European Union participates in the World Trade Organisation negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The mandate for the comprehensive round of negotiations which was to be launched by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle at the end of last year was adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and confirmed subsequently by the General Affairs Council. The mandate acknowledges that the negotiations on agriculture will be based on the principles enshrined in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture under the Uruguay Round which recognises &ldquo;that the long-term objective of substantial progressive reductions in support and protection resulting in fundamental reform is an on-going process&rdquo;. In general terms, the mandate provides that: the EU position will be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999; the EU will be prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided the concept of the &ldquo;blue and green&rdquo; boxes will continue; the EU is prepared to negotiate reductions in export subsidies provided that all such support, especially export credits and less transparent forms of export support, is treated on an equal basis; similar instruments to the peace clause and the special safeguard clause will be needed in the future; an appropriate balance will be sought between trade and non-trade issues; the EU will seek recognition for the multifunctional role of agriculture, food safety, food quality and animal welfare, and the EU will actively promote special and differential treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The WTO Ministerial Conference adjourned without reaching agreement on the launch of a new comprehensive round of negotiations. However, under Article 20 of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, which requires WTO members to initiate negotiations on agriculture around this time, irrespective of <Col N="552" /> whether a new comprehensive round has been launched, negotiations on agriculture commenced on 24 March 2000 in Geneva with a special session of the WTO Committee on Agriculture. WTO members will submit positions and proposals for the new negotiations to the Committee which will meet again in June, September and November. In my view it is unlikely that substantive negotiations will get under way until early next year.</P>
    <P>I have been actively involved in the EU Council of Ministers in the preparation of the EU negotiating mandate and I will be working to ensure that the EU negotiating position is upheld.</P>

      <P>Specific food related initiatives designed to assist the development of the industry are set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The initiatives, which will be implemented through operational programmes currently being prepared, provide for a total public funding allocation of £282 million. Funding will be directed as follows: £120 million for capital investment; £83 million for research, technology and innovation; £48 million for marketing and promotion; and £31 million to address the human resources needs of the food industry.</P>
      <P>The £48 million intended for marketing and promotion will facilitate the achievement by An Bord Bia of its overall objective of increasing sales of Irish food and drink. In the context of input from the restaurant sector, An Bord Bia continues to work with restaurateurs and restaurant organisations, both in Ireland and overseas markets. In the current year, for example, the board is working closely with the restaurants, chefs and hotel organisations regarding the launch of Feile Bia 2000. This will be a major opportunity for the catering industry to showcase top quality Irish cuisine and the important part that this sector plays in the food industry.</P>

      <P>The overall objectives in the agriculture and related rural development areas in the coming period as set out in the national development plan are as follows: to ensure that primary agriculture becomes more competitive; to foster environmentally sustainable systems of production; to provide alternative sources of income for farmers through diversification of activities both on and off-farm; and to promote rural development generally by harnessing voluntary and community development at local level.</P>
      <P>Under Agenda 2000 substantial market support measures and direct payments to farmers are being put in place to tackle competitiveness. As regards the other areas, the new Council regulation on integrating agriculture and rural development provides the framework within which structural aid can be given to farmers and rural dwellers with a view to ensuring a sustainable future for rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures proposed by Ireland cover the improvement of farm structures through the scheme of installation aid for young farmers and the early retirement scheme; focusing on quality products at farm level through schemes related to animal breeding, welfare, hygiene and the environment; the provision of direct income support <Col N="554" /> to farmers in designated disadvantaged areas through compensatory allowances; developing alternative enterprises both on and off-farm through, for example, the western investment fund and Leader type area based rural development initiatives; and the provision of back-up research, advice and training in the agriculture and rural development areas, mainly through Teagasc.</P>
    <P>Negotiations with the European Commission on a new community support framework for Ireland are now almost completed and discussions with them on the draft operational programmes to draw down the EU funding have also commenced. Total public funding of the order of £3.5 billion is involved over the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>In view of the challenges facing the agriculture and food sector over the next few years, I established the agri-food 2010 committee in June 1999 to propose a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the next decade. The committee's report was presented to me on 24 March. I consider that it provides a valuable analysis of the future of the agri-food sector. As I have already announced, I intend to initiate a round of consultations with all interests in the sector on the detailed findings of the committee. These discussions should not take longer than three months and, when they are completed, I will make a definitive response to the report.</P>

The regulation specifically states that the advance equal to 60% of special beef, suckler cow and the new slaughter premium schemes may not be paid before 16 October of the calendar year in respect of which the premium is applied for. The 60% advance  is considered reasonable given the budgetary constraints and need to protect the funds as well as supporting the producer at critical periods. Advance payments of 80% are therefore not permissible without an amendment to the regulation.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to inspections by veterinary officials of member states of the European Union on live poultry imported into the European Union from third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspection posts at European Union borders are manned by veterinary officials from the relevant member state who are required to perform the following checks on live animals, including poultry, entering the community from third countries: a documentary check, to ensure that the veterinary certificates and other documents accompanying the animal/s are in order; an identity check to ensure that the documentation presented relates to the animal/s being imported; a physical check of the animal/s &ndash; this includes a clinical examination of the animal/s to ensure that they conform to the information in the accompanying veterinary certificate and that they are clinically healthy and it may also include sampling and laboratory testing where this is considered necessary and animals, including poultry, which are imported from third countries, must be <Col N="556" /> kept in isolation for a period of at least six weeks after import and must be clinically inspected at least once in that period by veterinary officials of the relevant member state &ndash; samples may be taken and laboratory analysis conducted during this period.</P>
    <P>The veterinary inspections are provided for in harmonised EU rules specifying the conditions under which live animals can be imported into the European Union from third countries. Such imports are allowed only from establishments which have been approved by the European Commission and these in turn must be situated in countries or parts of countries on the Commission's approved list. These harmonised rules are designed to ensure that live animals may be imported only from third countries which are in a position provide the guarantees which are necessary to protect animal and public health in the European Union. Detailed conditions also apply in regard to the import of poultry meat from third countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The State is already making and will continue to make a substantial contribution to the cost of the national beef assurance scheme. In the last three years, the Exchequer has invested over £16 million in the cattle identification and tracing system which is an integral part of the scheme. A further £12.3 million will be spent this year in providing ear tags and cattle passports to farmers and in maintaining and improving the computer system. The sizeable State contribution is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to minimising the additional costs to farmers arising from implementation of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that implementation of the national beef assurance scheme will impose major additional burdens on farmers. The standards that farmers will be required to meet are already largely contained in existing legislation. As the vast bulk of farmers are already complying with the relevant legislation, any additional costs to them will be minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the inspection arrangements, it is not my intention to impose expensive and bureaucratic arrangements on participants. My intention is that the farm inspections should be carried out at the time of the annual herd tests to minimise the costs and inconvenience for farmers. My officials will recommence negotiations with the farming and veterinary organisations in order to reach agreement on a practicable, workable and credible inspection procedure. There will be <Col N="557" /> ample opportunity over the coming months to arrive at a sensible and fair system of inspection that will not create an unacceptable burden for farmers.</P>

      <P>The number of students attending the agricultural colleges in the current year is 792. The comparable figures for 1995 and 1996 were 1,118 and 1,091, respectively. In the case of the horticultural colleges, the trend in recent years has been fairly stable with 275 students attending in 1995, 276 in 1996 and 252 in 1999.</P>
      <P>An ESRI study produced for Teagasc last year suggested reasons including the following for the decline in student numbers in the agricultural colleges: declining numbers of farms; declining school-leaving population; increased availability of third level educational places, and increased off-farm job opportunities, locally and nationally, for young school-leavers from a farming background.</P>
      <P>I once again emphasise the importance of agricultural education and training for any young person who intends to take up farming. Continuing technological and economic changes make such training essential for a successful career in the demanding world of modern farming.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that young trained farmers can avail of significant financial benefits from the State including stamp duty relief and installation aid. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the stamp duty on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to trained young farmers is being abolished. Trained young farmers also qualify for the transfer of land under the early retirement scheme for farmers.</P>
      <P>Last November, I established a task force to review the training needs of agriculture in the light of the changing social and economic circumstances. The task force will address the issue of declining student numbers and I look forward to receiving its report next month.</P>

      <P>The trial of three mechanical beef classification systems has now completed its second evaluation stage. A report will be completed within the next weeks on the basis of which the manufacturers will be invited to refine the system further. This report will also be the basis for discussions with the EU Commission in order to set parameters at EU level for testing machines leading to the eventual introduction of a mechanical system.</P>
      <P>The Commission has not yet adopted a position on the trial. However, it is evident from the standards set down in its draft proposal for a mechanical classification system that, while considerable progress has been made in developing a mechanical classification system, further work is needed to achieve a level of accuracy which would be acceptable to the Commission. I expect the companies involved to undertake this work over the coming months in conjunction with my Department and Teagasc in order to assess whether the accuracy of the machines can be improved to the standards set down in the draft proposal. Mechanical grading cannot be officially introduced until a machine is approved as meeting these standards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decision to establish a price transparency mechanism based on independent verification is being implemented through the monitoring committee of the beef task force which I set up to implement the recommendations of the beef task force.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of export markets for Irish food products is primarily the responsibility of the food industry working in conjunction with my Department and An Bord Bia. In that context, I have visited a number of key market outlets.</P>
      <P>The Irish meat and dairy industries export to a wide range of markets worldwide. It is my objective to ensure that all of these markets remain open to Irish meat exports and that all available market outlets, particularly the high valued added markets, are fully exploited. While the Irish share of the EU market for beef has fallen since 1995 because of the renationalisation of the EU market in the aftermath of the 1996 BSE scare, considerable progress has been made in regaining these markets. Irish beef exports performed strongly on continental EU markets in 1999 when exports to France increased by 14%, to Italy by 33% and to other EU destinations by 36%. Nevertheless, it remains one of the major priorities for the Irish beef industry to recover and consolidate its presence on EU markets. In that context I have visited Italy, France and the Netherlands recently to promote the consumption of Irish beef in those markets.</P>
      <P>In the case of lamb, while there have been some moves towards re-nationalisation of certain markets, especially in France and Spain, Irish exports of lamb increased by almost 6% in the last year. Bord Bia continues to seek new markets for lamb and is currently involved in lamb promotion campaigns in France and Scandinavia. A good market for Irish lamb is expected in the Mediterranean region in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996, Irish exports of pigmeat have increased by 35% to 135,000 tonnes and, despite the difficult market conditions, there was an 8% <Col N="563" /> increase in sales last year. Exports to the UK are expected to strengthen during the year, sales to continental Europe are forecast to increase gradually during 2000 and the prospects for further increased exports to Japan this year are positive.</P>
    <P>Looking forward, the prospects for dairy commodities and dairy ingredients are quite positive. I expect that the growth in income levels and changing eating patterns in developing countries over the medium term will boost demand for dairy products in these markets. There is continuing scope to increase Ireland's penetration of the internal EU market for value added dairy products. In addition, Eastern enlargement of the EU over the medium term should also provide valuable outlets for high quality Irish dairy products.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of support for the agri-food industry to enable us to maintain and improve our competitiveness both domestically and on export markets, there are specific food related initiatives set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 designed to assist product development. Those initiatives provide for a total public funding allocation of £282 million and will be implemented as part of operational programmes that are currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with An Bord Bia, will continue to endeavour to exploit opportunities in both the EU and international markets. Nevertheless, in the final analysis it is a matter for the agri-food industry to capitalise on the high quality of Irish products. I am satisfied that the State services provided to the food industry, through An Bord Bia and other agencies, will help the industry to achieve the objective of maintaining and increasing our market share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>DÍON is the Government's advisory committee on issues of concern to the Irish community in Britain. The DÍON fund assists Irish welfare organisations working with disadvantaged members of the Irish community in Britain.  It provides grants mainly to Irish voluntary organisations for welfare, community care and development work; it contributes to the salary costs of second tier organisations such as the Federation of Irish Societies (FIS) and the Action Group for Irish Youth (AGIY); and it may fund research into issues of concern to the Irish community. Thirty eight welfare organisations benefited in 1999.</P>
      <P>DÍON has paid out a total of almost IR£7 million to Irish emigrant welfare groups since its inception in 1984. The Government is keenly aware of difficulties faced by members of the Irish community in Britain through the <i>Díon</i> Committee and various reports which have been published, such as the Commission on Racial Equality's report on Discrimination and the Irish Community in Britain, and those produced under the auspices of the Federation of Irish Societies concerning health and the elderly. There was a significant increase &ndash; £137,000 &ndash; in the DÍON budget in 1999 &ndash; from £613,000 to £750,000 specifically to improve services for older people and travellers in Britain. I am pleased to say that in 1999, six new Irish elders projects and four new Irish travellers projects were assisted by <i>DÍON; </i>and that grants totalling £152,000 went to elders projects and £54,400 went to Irish travellers projects.  In addition, a commitment was given to maintain the overall increase in the DÍON grant in 2000 and 2001. The increase has been maintained as promised and £765,000 has been provided for DÍON in 2000, a 2% increase on 1999.  This acknowledges the Government's appreciation of the very valuable and culturally sensitive services which Irish community organisations provide to the less well off and disadvantaged members of the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> I know that representations have been made to the embassy in London by the Federation of Irish Societies and several organisations who receive grants from DÍON about the adverse effects which the strength of sterling is having on the value of the DÍON grants paid to Irish welfare organisations which assist vulnerable people in the Irish community in Britain. This issue was raised at meetings which I had with Irish community representatives in 1999 and more recently by the Federation of Irish Societies' delegation with whom I had a meeting in Dublin last week.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of adequately resourcing organisations working with the Irish community in Britain. While the DÍON grant allocation for 2000 stands at £765,000, I fully appreciate that the growing strength of Sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish pound in recent times has reduced the impact of the grant to the emigrant welfare organisations, who apply in sterling but get paid in Irish pounds. My Department is examining this issue, and the federation's request for an increase in the DÍON fund, as a matter of urgency to see what steps may be available to me to address the currency exposure issue as well as reviewing the level of the DÍON grant in this and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The £560 million technology foresight fund was recently established in response to the increasingly important link between technological development and the future competitiveness of Irish based industry. It marks a new departure for public sector investment in modern sectors of technology, identified by the highly consultative technology foresight study as being key drivers in future competitiveness. The fund will be used to establish Ireland as a location for world class excellence in niche areas within information and communications technologies and biotechnology. A dedicated foundation, operating under the aegis of Forfás, is being established to manage, allocate, disburse and evaluate expenditure under the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that the foundation will have a two pronged approach to funding. Researchers in third level colleges and research institutions will be offered the opportunity to compete for funds through the international peer review process. The foundation will have the option to establish its own laboratories if necessary to secure world class performance. In achieving its objective, the foundation will consult widely with national and <Col N="568" /> international experts in selecting the niche areas; fund world class research in the selected niches on the basis of a competitive international peer review process; and ensure that continuation of support for any project funded by the new foundation will be dependent on a continuing research output at a world class level.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Allen's query about the implications of the fund on the Health Research Board's areas of research activities, the level of funds to be awarded to particular types of research, including health-related research, will be a matter for decision by the management of the foundation. Such allocations will emerge from the consultation and competitive process I have outlined above. However, I would stress that the technology foresight funding is additional and complementary to existing spends by Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>I have recently received the report and recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. The review group reported on merger and competition law and administration and made a wide range of recommendations in this area. The work of the group also covered the groceries order which provides for a ban on below cost selling. I will now consider the report and recommendations of the review group on all the matters referred to it before deciding what further action to take and I will publish it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal piece of legislation dealing <Col N="570" /> with occupational health and safety. It is, in the first instance, the duty of an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all his employees. Under section 12 of the 1989 Act, every employer must prepare a safety statement which should be based on an identification and assessment of all hazards and risks in the workplace and which should specify the way in which the safety, health and welfare of employees is to be secured.</P>
      <P>Under the 1989 Act, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health and matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority. The authority can be contacted at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2 &ndash; telephone 01-6147000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties being experienced by young people in securing motor insurance and, indeed, the high cost of compulsory insurance cover for motorists, in particular young drivers, is, I understand, directly attributable to adverse claims experience of young, especially male, drivers as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board, whose expanded membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and research, particularly in relation to the basis of charges to young drivers. EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Therefore, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency <Col N="572" /> of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been asked to look at a graduated licensing system for learner drivers, based on the Ontario model which could have a significant impact if introduced here in Ireland. For those motorists who are having difficulty getting a quote for motor insurance and in recognition of the compulsory nature of third party motor insurance the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance on 21 February last. The alliance raised issues related to quarry owners who had lost their business as a result of practices in the quarry and concrete business which they considered to be unfair and to constitute an abuse of a monopoly position. It expressed the view that the Competition <Col N="573" /> Authority was not able to investigate this issue properly due to lack of resources. The alliance also expressed particular concern about the beneficial ownership of a number of companies.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the appointment of a new chairman and member in the Competition Authority and other appointments, both at professional and non-professional level, will follow. In addition, my Department, together with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study of the authority's operations with a view to assessing the authority's future resource requirements. I am fully committed to ensuring that the authority is adequately resourced to discharge its important statutory functions and I will speedily address any resource deficiency identified in the study when the report is to hand. My Department is pursuing inquiries about the exercise of beneficial ownership in the cases identified. I will be in contact with the alliance again when the issues raised in its submission to me have been fully considered.</P>

      <P>Diving for razor clams and other shellfish is prohibited by a by-law under the Fisheries Acts made in 1966.</P>
      <P>An amendment of the by-law to permit the holders of aquaculture licences to dive for shellfish at their licensed sites is being considered by my Department at present. The question of allowing diving for wild shellfish stocks will have to be addressed, however, by reference to scientific advice on the implications of this fishing method for the stocks concerned, and any decision would have to be made in the context of overall strategies for the conservation and development of inshore fisheries.</P>
      <P>My Department is initiating consultations with other relevant bodies and interests on the scientific and other issues which arise on the question of allowing diving for wild shellfish stocks.</P>

      <P>As previously indicated, the application for higher forestry incentives submitted to the European Commission by the Irish Administration last August proposed increased premium levels for those who planted under Council Regulation 2080/92 as well as for those proposing to plant in the current season. However, because of the protracted nature of the discussions with the Commission, I decided that the primary focus would have to be on securing increases which would have an impact on planting in the current season. The substantial increases announced by me on 6 March achieved that objective.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on that occasion, it is the intention now to pursue the question of adequate increases for those who planted in earlier years. The matter was raised by me last week with Commissioner Fischler and is now being pursued at official level. I will remain in close contact with developments.</P>

      <P>A number of competing private sector shipping companies provide shipping services to serve Irish importers and exporters. These companies have been innovative in their pro<Col N="578" /> vision of jumbo ferries, fast ferries and dedicated container ships to serve the growing Irish economy. I am not aware that there is any lack of shipping capacity on the sea routes serving Ireland.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries' recent commissioning of a shipyard to build the world's largest cruise ferry for service on the Irish sea is one indication of the dynamism of the Irish shipping sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's recent initiative, setting up by statute in December last a new dedicated Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) within the Marine Institute with the following remit: to promote and assist the development of Irish shipping and Irish shipping services; to promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration; to develop and implement a strategic framework for the shipping industry and its ancillary service sector; and to liaise with and support the industry and advise on policy initiatives and overhaul of the legislative framework for the mercantile marine so as to underpin industrial development and safeguard and generate employment.</P>
      <P>An expert advisory group for the Irish Maritime Development Office comprising representatives of the shipping industry and shipping services sector, IDA Ireland, independent financial, legal and business people and Departments was formally established in December 1999.</P>
      <P>Advertisements have recently been placed in the press for the position of director of the IMDO and the recruitment of additional staff will follow that appointment.</P>
      <P>The IMDO provides the Government with the means to address any issues of concern which might arise regarding the adequacy of shipping capacity serving the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that policy on ports is to provide sufficient capacity to meet the growth in demand for shipping services and to allow for competition between shippers, to the benefit of importers and exporters, in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely acknowledged &ndash; not least by the Mexican Government itself &ndash; that there are serious systemic human rights deficiencies in Mexico. At the recent meeting with the EU Troika in Portugal, the Mexican Foreign Minister reiterated her Government's commitment to the cause of human rights and to maintaining a frank and open dialogue with Mexico's international partners on this vital subject. The Mexican government shares the EU view that there is a long way <Col N="580" /> to go before full respect for human rights can be ensured.</P>
      <P>In 1990, the Mexican government established a National Commission for Human Rights. This achieved considerable progress, but a further major step was taken in September 1999 when the constitution was changed to give administrative and budgetary autonomy to the National Human Rights Commissioner and his Commission. The commissioner is now independent of the government and is appointed by and reports to the Congress. The new, more independent commissioner has set himself the challenging task of seeking to educate all elements of society, including the police and courts, in the basic importance of human rights, so as to create a culture of respect for those rights.</P>
      <P>These internal developments have been matched by positive initiatives internationally, including the successful visit to Mexico last November of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, at the invitation of the Mexican government, increasing co-operation with EU countries in terms of practical human rights projects, recognition of the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Justice, and the admission of Mexico to observer status at the Council of Europe under the auspices of the Irish Presidency where Mexico will have the benefit of that organisation's unparalleled experience in defending and promoting human rights.</P>
      <P>It is against this background of enhanced awareness in Mexican official circles of the fundamental importance of human rights, and of the increasingly open and frank dialogue on this key subject which Mexico is willing to maintain with its international friends and partners, that embassies of the European Union in Mexico City were able to hold a meeting late last year with the Mexican authorities in which they discussed their concern about threats made against officials of the Mexican human rights organisation, Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Augustúín Pro Juárez (PRODH), a concern fully shared in the Mexican Foreign Ministry. In addition to the threats made, one PRODH official, Ms Digna Ochoa, had been attacked on two occasions, as a result of which arrangements for official security protection were agreed between the Mexican authorities and PRODH.</P>
      <P>Much work will require to be done over time to translate the Mexican Government's human rights commitments into a new reality throughout the country. The European Union intends to maintain a continuing dialogue with the Mexican authorities to help achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>All available accommodation within occupied military posts is currently fully utilised and any surplus accommodation which previously existed has been filled by personnel relocated from barracks which have been closed. The most recent survey of accommodation capacity was conducted in 1999.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing review of the Department's properties and bearing in mind the continuing pressure on land resources in major cities and towns, I have decided that as a contribution to alleviating the shortage of land for social housing the following properties adjoining barracks should be disposed of on the open market or by agreement with the relevant local authority for full value: Susan's Field, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, six acres; Old Married Quarters, adjoining Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, 2.5 acres; Mellowes Field, adjoining Renmore Barracks, Galway, ten acres.</P>

The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth, Clancy Barracks, will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>On 14 September 1999 I met with councillors and an official of Kildare County Council in relation to Magee Barracks, Kildare. The council was anxious that the land would be available for housing and commercial development. They wishes to preserve the commercial integrity of the town centre and to ensure ease of pedestrian and vehicular access within the new and enhanced town development programme. I indicated that I proposed to have an area action plan prepared for the barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands.

It is expected that the consultants will be appointed shortly. The consultants selected will submit a <Col N="584" /> report within three months of appointment.

      <P>The person named was approved for participation in REPS in August 1997. The agri-environmental plan showed that he wished to avail of supplementary measure 2, rejuvenate degraded areas, but payment was made in respect of supplementary measure 1, natural heritage areas, in error.</P>
      <P>The application for second year payment again included supplementary measure 2. When payment for year two was being made, account was taken of the previous year's error, which had led to an overpayment, and the level of payment was adjusted accordingly.</P>
      <P>When application for payment for the third year of the scheme was received, it contained an application for payment under supplementary measure 1. However, the applicant had not submitted an amended plan and it was not possible to make payment under this supplementary measure. Payment has continued on the basis of supplementary measure 2 which provides, where stock numbers are reduced to sustainable levels on the commonage and grazing is permitted throughout the year, an area payment of 72 euro per hectare subject to a maximum of 40 hectares with an additional annual premium of 254 euro per livestock unit reduced.</P>
      <P>The REP scheme was amended in 1999 with the various supplementary measures available to farmers with land in NH. As amalgamated into one new supplementary measure, SMA conservation of natural heritage. Existing participants at the time could choose to continue their existing contracts or avail of payments under the new measure. The person named has not made application for payment under the new measure.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has laid down harmonised rules governing the veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra-community trade in live animals, including poultry, and animal products, including poultry products. These rules require a range of such checks to be carried out and also provide for the imposition of restrictions on or the banning of intra-community trade in particular animal products when this is considered necessary for the protection of public health. Last year's Belgian dioxin scare is a case in point where trade in a wide range of animal products from Belgium, including poultry products, was banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Standing Veterinary Committee of the European Commission, which is chaired by the Commission's Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection, and in which experts <Col N="589" /> from my Department participate, constantly monitors events in member states and third countries, such as disease outbreaks or contamination of food or feedstuffs, which are likely to have implications for public health. This committee was instrumental in imposing the ban on Belgian products during the dioxin crisis and has also been involved in the decisions to lift restrictions as the risks diminished. No restrictions on trade have been imposed arising from the feeding of meat and bonemeal to poultry in any member state of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised Commission rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risks provided for under the aegis of the Standing Veterinary Committee, have and will continue to prove effective in ensuring that animal products imported from other member states, including those referred to by the Deputy, are fit for human consumption.</P>

      <P>The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, was introduced on 1 June 1994 following the implementation of Council Regulation 2078/92, which governed the three accompanying measures to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REP scheme was revised on 1 January 1999 and included a new supplementary measure, SMA, which applies to farmers with land in natural heritage areas, NHAs, special areas of conservation, SACs, special protection areas, and commonages. The criteria for the eligibility of commonage land under supplementary measure A of the REP scheme are formulated on the basis of the approval granted by the European Commission. The provisions of supplementary measure A are designed to provide a comprehensive approach to the conservation and /or regeneration of these target areas. Included in the new measure is the requirement for an agri-environment framework plan to be drawn up for each <Col N="592" /> commonage, setting specific criteria for sustainable farming. As an interim measure, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, a national commonage framework plan was put in place to address the problem of overgrazed commonages in the worst affected counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.</P>
    <P>The conditions of approval of supplementary measure A require that an agri-environment framework plan be drawn up for each commonage to include the establishment of a grazing regime including environmental stocking levels for the total area of the commonage; an overall grassland management plan; and measures for habitat protection.</P>
    <P>The details to be included in commonage framework plans were agreed at European Commission level and teams consisting of an agriculturalist and an environmentalist were given specific training by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the methodology to be used in drawing up such plans. All commonage framework plans drawn up by the trained teams must be approved by both Departments.</P>
    <P>The total area of commonage for which framework plans must be prepared is in the order of 480,000 hectares. Work on the preparation of the plans is ongoing and approximately 346,000 hectares have already been assigned to teams of which 163,619 hectares have been recommended for approval. Regular meetings are held between both Departments to monitor progress and projections are that the majority of framework plans will be completed by the end of 2000.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that the scheme of farm waste management will provide for a grant rate of 40% of approved costs subject to a maximum grant of £16,000 for farmers with income units up to 150 and a grant rate of 20% of approved costs subject to a maximum grant of £8,000 for farmers having income units between 151 and 200. Similar grant rates are proposed for the scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards with a maximum grant of £10,000 for farmers with income units up to 150 and £5,000 for farmers having income units in the range of 151 and 200 units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to bovine TB is that significantly higher numbers of reactors were disclosed throughout the country in 1998 and 1999 than in the preceding years. Coincidentally, there have also been increased levels of disease disclosed in Northern Ireland and in parts of Britain. Veterinary experts both here and in the UK have not as yet established the precise reasons for these increases but among the factors considered to be involved are the cyclical nature of the disease, higher cattle numbers, higher stocking density, poor weather conditions which may have made animals more susceptible to the disease, some fraud and infected wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> The current high level of TB is not sustainable for a variety of reasons, including potential risks to human and animal health, trading implications, production losses, the disruption of normal farming activities, and, of course, the budgetary implications that the current levels of disease have for Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it has been agreed to commit specified staff resources in each district veterinary office to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdown. A proactive approach to the removal of all sources of infection will be taken in each DVO area using additional dedicated departmental and farm relief service personnel. Their efforts will be concentrated in that 20% of the country which yields 50% of current reactors.</P>

      <P>Following a period where the incidence of brucellosis was relatively stable, the situation deteriorated in 1996, 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>In view of the deterioration in the incidence of the disease, it became necessary over the past two years to introduce a number of new measures to control the disease. These measures included the introduction of a 30-day pre-movement test from 23 February 1998 for all female cattle over 12 months of age and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises.</P>
      <P>More recently, a number of initiatives were introduced in order to further enhance the eradication programme. These include the taking of blood samples from cows at slaughter plants and increased use of the milk elisa test which is more specific, less false positives, and more sensitive, less false negatives, than the milk ring test. The serum agglutination test used on blood samples analysed at the laboratory is also being replaced by the elisa test.</P>
      <P>The full impact of the new measures are being evaluated but already there are signs that the position is improving. The current programme was reviewed by an EU veterinary mission during 1999 and its report broadly endorsed the measures now in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1999, the National Brucellosis Laboratory in Cork tested some 5.5 million blood samples compared to 5.3 million in 1998 and 3.5 million in 1997. Despite the more intensive level of testing, the number of reactors disclosed fell from 6,417 in 1998 to 4,545 last year whilst the number of herds restricted in accordance with EU legislation fell from 383 in 1998 to 228 in <Col N="599" /> 1999. There is some initial evidence of a continuation of this trend this year.</P>

      <P>Support for the food industry has been given effect mainly through the food sub-programme which covered the period from 1994 to 1999 The main aim was to improve the competitiveness of our food industry on both home and export markets. That this strategy has been successful is underlined by the fact that the output of the industry has increased by £2.2 billion of which over £1 billion worth was sold on the home market. This suggests that Irish food companies are being provided with and are availing of opportunities to retain and to improve their position on both domestic and export markets.</P>
      <P>The future success of the food industry will, I believe, be underpinned by the specific food-related initiatives set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. These initiatives which provide for an overall public funding allocation of £282 million will focus on strategies to further improve competitiveness and market orientation. I am confident that it will enable the industry to build on the success engendered under the food sub-programme, thereby enabling it to meet the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</P>

An Bord Bia has recently been involved in a generic lamb promotion campaign in France in conjunction with Interbev. It is also looking at markets in Scandinavia. The market for Irish lamb in the Mediterranean region is expected to be relatively strong this year.</P>

      <P>While the export of pork is primarily a matter for the industry, ongoing support in every way possible continues to be provided in terms of promotion by An Bord Bia and also by my Department in the context of market support and veterinary matters.</P>
      <P>Irish pork and bacon is currently exported to more than 40 countries around the world. The principal volume markets are within the European community and by value some 12% is exported to destinations outside the EU.</P>
      <P>Since the conclusion of the last WTO agreement, Irish exporters have access to a number of new non-EU markets and for example, in the far east they have capitalised on this. In 1999 exports to the Japanese market increased to almost 10,000 tonnes from a level of 3,000 to 5,000 tonnes a few years ago. Additionally, new customers have been developed in markets such as South Korea, China and the Philippines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year Ireland's trade to Russia was boosted greatly by the industry obtaining special veterin<Col N="602" /> ary approval for supplying pork destined for retail sale. Exports increased threefold to 6,700 tonnes.</P>
    <P>There are exports of Irish pork to all the major EU markets, with the principal ones being the UK, Germany, Italy and France. The opening up of the Swedish market in 1998-99 represented an important step in the development of this business.</P>

      <P>The agri food 2010 committee was established in June 1999. Its terms of reference were to propose a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the next decade, following the agreement on Agenda 2000, and in the light of the changes and challenges which are likely to evolve nationally and internationally over that period.</P>
      <P>The committee, which was independent in its operation and findings, consisted of leading figures from all areas of the agri-food sector.</P>
      <P>The report was presented to me on 24 March. It describes the context in which the sector will have to operate over the next decade; identifies the key issues arising; sets out the committee's vision for the future; and proposes strategies necessary to achieve that vision.</P>
      <P>I consider that the Agri Food 2010 Committee report provides a valuable analysis of the future of the agri-food sector. As I have already indicated, I intend to initiate a round of consultations with all interests in the sector on the detailed findings of the committee. These discussions should not take longer than three months and, when they are completed, I will make a definitive response to the report.</P>

      <P>The European Union participates in the World Trade Organisation negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The mandate for the comprehensive round of negotiations which was to be launched by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle at the end of last year was adopted by the EU Coun<Col N="603" /> cil of Ministers on 27 September 1999 and confirmed subsequently by the General Affairs Council. In relation to access to world markets, the mandate provides that the EU, as a major food exporter, must act with a view to sharing in the expansion of world trade, which will result from the new round of negotiations; while the EU is prepared to negotiate a lowering of trade barriers in agriculture, it must also obtain, as a counterpart, improvements in market opportunities for its exporters; the council is prepared to negotiate the process of reductions in export subsidies provided that all such support is treated on an equal basis; a discipline on the use of export credits must be introduced and appropriate solutions must be found to other less transparent forms of export support such as state trading and the provision of food aid.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the negotiating mandate is designed to protect the position of EU, including Irish, exporters on world markets. I will be monitoring the negotiations closely as they progress.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a new scheme of early retirement from farming were submitted to the European Commission in December 1999 as part of my Department's draft rural development plan for the period 2000-06. The commission has six months from the date of submission to consider the plan.</P>
      <P>The proposed new early retirement scheme is different in some respects from the scheme which ended on 31 December last. The former requirement to enlarge the transferred holding is replaced by a viability criterion, and the requirement that the transferor and transferee be engaged in farming as a main occupation is no longer specified. Other changes include an income ceiling for certain transferors and a limit on transferees' off-farm income, a phased reduction in the upper age limit for receipt of payments and a phased reduction in the upper age limit for transferees. New agri-environmental conditions applying to transferees are proposed. In addition, the proposals provide for an element of indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>The terms of the scheme, including the elements outlined above, are subject to the approval of the European Commission.</P>

      <P>It is the wife of the man concerned who is a participant in the early retirement scheme. She was admitted to the scheme in October 1997 under the joint management arrangement with her husband. It is a condition of the scheme that in a joint management application, a participant or a participant's spouse must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned became entitled to the contributory old age pension with effect from 19 December 1997. On confirmation of this, my Department adjusted the early retirement pension accordingly. However, the pension that he receives from the private pension fund is not deducted from the early retirement pension as the abatement rule applies only to state pensions.</P>

      <P>The first two parts of the Deputy's question seem to relate to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry. Detailed investigations were undertaken in a number of cases which were highlighted by that tribunal of inquiry. In one particular case, all plants of a company and its <Col N="606" /> subsidiaries were visited by Revenue investigators and a settlement of £4 million approximately was reached; this covered liabilities in respect of untaxed payments to employees and all of this sum has been paid. All other marts and beef factories in the State, some 250 cases, were visited by Revenue auditors in 1994. Many of these cases would have been revisited on a number of occasions since then as part of normal district compliance and audit programmes.</P>
      <P>Specific audit statistics are available in relation to the beef processing sector, as distinct from the meat processing sector generally, only for the years 1998 and 1999. The following table shows the results for audits where the yield was in excess of £10,000.</P>

    <P>Another case which came to light subsequent to the beef tribunal's report was the subject of a successful criminal prosecution in 1999 and a settlement of £3.3 million approximately was obtained in respect of PAYE-PRSI liabilities.</P>
    <P>The remaining parts of the Deputy's question seem to relate to other tribunals and follow-up to Companies Act investigations. This would include the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals, and related Company Act investigations, as well as the investigations into the Ansbacher accounts, but would not include inquiries as regards deposit interest retention tax. Work in all these areas is ongoing. The Deputy will be aware that the Revenue Commissioners yesterday announced agreement on a settlement of £1 million in respect of one case covered by the McCracken tribunal. Payments on account totalling some £3 million have also been obtained in respect of other cases covered by the tribunals-investigations mentioned. These sums do not include receipts from National Irish Bank cases where inquiries were initiated separately.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to isolate specific amounts collected annually as a result of changes in administration or statute as a result of the various disclosures of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Parts of the Deputy's question have been expressed in very broad terms. If there is any more specific information that he is seeking I will be happy to see if it can be provided.</P>

      <P>A farmer, as defined in the Value Added Tax Act, 1972, is not required to register for VAT but may elect to register if he or she so wishes. Where a <Col N="608" /> farmer voluntarily becomes registered for VAT and if he or she subsequently wishes to deregister the following conditions must be met.</P>
      <P>The farmer must notify Revenue of his or her desire to deregister or that he or she no longer wishes to be treated as taxable. Revenue is then notified by the farmer of the VAT payments made and of the total VAT refunded in the entire period during which the farmer was taxable, or the preceding three years, whichever is the shorter. The farmer then pays Revenue an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the refunds over the payments made for the particular review period chosen. The details of the computation of figures involved are worked out by the local inspector of taxes by reference to the regulations.</P>
      <P>If a farmer owns holiday accommodation, there are separate rules for deregistration as a result of changes made in the Finance Act, 2000. The changes in the law require that those who elect to register for VAT in respect of the letting out of holiday accommodation and who have an annual turnover of less than £20,000, must in certain circumstances pay a cancellation amount to the Revenue Commissioners when they cancel their election to register. The cancellation amount is calculated on the basis of the amount of VAT deductible on the property used for the holiday lettings and the length of time the property was let before the cancellation. No cancellation amount is payable if the length of time involved exceeds ten years.</P>

      <P>Agricultural and business reliefs apply under the capital acquisitions tax legislation whereby the value of gifts or inheritances received may be reduced by 90% for CAT purposes, subject to certain qualifying conditions. These are very generous reliefs and at present, a farm or business valued up to £3 million can be transferred to a son or daughter free of CAT. Agricultural relief applies only where the beneficiary's assets are 80% or more made up of agricultural assets after the gift or inheritance. Qualifying agricultural assets include land, buildings, livestock and machinery.</P>

However, other conditions must be met under this relief which do not apply to agricultural relief, for example, a minimum share holding requirement in the case of shares in a company acquired by gift-inheritance and a minimum period of ownership requirement by the disponer. CAT business relief is aimed at entrepreneurs <Col N="609" /> with a stake in their own business. It does not apply to the transfer of individual business assets. Agricultural relief, on the other hand, facilitates the transfer of individual farming assets. Some of the conditions which must be met for the purposes of business relief, would if brought to bear for agricultural relief purposes, be viewed as restricting the availability of the latter.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 2000, enables agricultural property to qualify for business relief, where the relevant criteria are met, in circumstances where it fails to qualify for agricultural relief. The Act also closes off loopholes in the law through which persons can get around the 80% asset test by the temporary disposal of non-agricultural assets and their later reacquisition after relief has been claimed.</P>
    <P>CAT agricultural relief is intended to apply specifically to farmers and it is important to apply some yardstick in order to determine whether or not an individual is a farmer. The 80% test was devised to act as such a yardstick. The requirement that 80% of an individual's assets be comprised of agricultural property ensures that the relief is focused on genuine farmers rather than on individuals who have substantial holdings of non-agricultural assets and who may be engaged in farming.</P>

      <P>There are no penalties for farmers who opt to discontinue assessment of tax under averaging of farm profits. In such cases the two years of assessment prior to the last averaging year are reviewed and if the existing assessment for either or both years is less than the amount of the assessment for the last averaging year, an additional assessment for the difference is made for the year or years affected. The adjustment to the assessments on review for the two years specified merely ensures that the total amount charged to tax for those two years and the following year, which is the preceding year of assessment for which the farmer opts out or is deemed to opt out, will not be less than the profits shown in the accounts for those three years. The farming sector is the only sector in the State that can avail of income averaging for the assessment of tax on profits and I have no plans to amend the current legislation covering income averaging for farmers.</P>

The health boards have established a number of multi-disciplinary teams comprising speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses and social workers to provide health related support services to children with autism and, in particular, special classes for children with autism are being developed by the Department of Education and Science.

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services in St. James's Hospital now rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have, therefore, asked the regional chief executive to investigate the issue raised by the Deputy and reply directly to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, adult cardiac by-<Col N="613" /> pass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St. James's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1998 my Department allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, my Department made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and a further £4 million will be made available in 2000. I am confident that this funding will build on previous years success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has had and will continue to have a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,619 in September 1997 to 1,202 in December 1999, this represents a reduction of 25%.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by more than 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital, to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 86 of 1998) give effect to EU Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. These regulations oblige proprietors of food businesses to ensure that their businesses are operated in a hygienic way. The rules of hygiene cover requirements for,<i> inter alia,</i> personal hygiene and training. The proprietor of a food business must ensure that food handlers are supervised and instructed and-or trained in food hygiene matters commensurate with their work activity. Proprietors are also obliged to identify steps in the activities of a business which are critical to ensuring safety and ensure that adequate safety procedures are identified, implemented and reviewed. This is known as hazard analysis critical control points. The regulations also provide for the development of guides to good hygiene practice.</P>
      <P>Since July of last year, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for the enforcement of all food safety legislation in Ireland, including those regulations dealing with food hygiene. The authority carries out its functions by means of service contracts with a range of official agencies, for example, health boards, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the authority meets with health boards on a regular basis to monitor the implementation of the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998. I also understand that the FSAI is currently in the process of developing a strategy to audit the official agencies in their enforcement of the food legis<Col N="616" /> lation including, in the case of the hygiene of foodstuffs regulations, the health boards.</P>
    <P>Funding has been provided for the introduction of a quality management system in the environmental health food control service and which has already been successfully pilot-tested in three health boards. This system aims to enable the food control service achieve external accreditation to ISO 9002 standard. The system requires the provision and maintenance of appropriate records, the design and introduction of nineteen standards operational procedures and a programme of ongoing training and professional development of environmental health staff.</P>
    <P>The guides to good hygiene practice act as guides for industry on compliance with the provisions of the hygiene regulations. These guides were developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and agreed through working groups representative of regulators and industry. IS 340 deals with hygiene in the catering sector; IS 341 deals with hygiene in the food retailing-wholesaling sector; IS 342 deals with hygiene in the food processing industry; and IS 3219 deals with hygiene in the food and drink manufacturing industry. The standards identify, in as far as practicable, the specific requirements that must be met by the business sectors to which they are addressed. Enforcement officers must have regard to these guides in their inspections. The guides are available from the NSAI for a fee.</P>
    <P>The FSAI is collaborating with the food industry sector and official food control agencies in a number of initiatives that focus on training workers in the food industry in food hygiene and safe handling. These initiatives are free of charge to the target groups.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Training Council was formed in 1999 and comprises representatives from all sectors of the food industry, training providers and inspectors. The aim of this council is to co-ordinate and improve food safety training and practice in Ireland and to develop guidelines for the inspection of effective training in the workplace.</P>
    <P>After full consultation with the food industry and training providers the agreed approach is to develop standards based on competency. This means that the standards will specify what a food handler should know and be competent at for the level of job undertaken. Standards will be developed by sub-groups of the council for all sectors of the food industry. Sub-committees have now been formed by the council to agree expected standards of skills and knowledge required of all employees in the food industry in the area of food safety.</P>
    <P>The FSAI is developing a database which will serve as a complete source of information for industry on training in food safety. The FSAI has been involved in direct training activities in the form of food safety lectures. In association with industry, the FSAI has delivered the food safety message directly to food handlers and business owners. In two series of nationwide seminars dur<Col N="617" /> ing 1999 the FSAI delivered food hygiene lectures to over 600 owners and employees of catering and delicatessen-store businesses. These seminars were designed to promote safe food handling practices, particularly in the &ldquo;fast-food&rdquo; context, and were accompanied by a leaflet titled &ldquo;Safe Food-to-Go&rdquo; to reinforce the messages delivered.</P>
    <P>The health boards have run seminars in relation to food hygiene e.g. in County Kildare, 800 business owners recently attended a series of meetings run by the health board in relation to HACCP, hazard analysis critical control points.</P>
    <P>In addition to the FSAI initiatives referred to above, I draw the Deputy's attention to the Primary Food Hygiene Course, an initiative of the Environmental Health Officers Association aimed at raising standards in food safety which I launched in July 1999. Its objective is to provide staff involved in food preparation with adequate training in the basic principles of food hygiene. The course has been specially developed for Irish conditions and is being delivered to food workers in their workplaces by either environmental health officers or external tutors and is supported by a training video and a text book. A fee is charged for this course.</P>
    <P>The National Hygiene Partnership, comprising CERT, the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute, Excellence Ireland, NSAI, the FSAI and my Department, have developed a number of training initiatives. The management of hygiene in the hospitality sector is delivered to supervisors-managers of food businesses. This course is based on the IS 340 as mentioned earlier. The partnership has recently updated its induction training booklet entitled &ldquo;Hygiene Matters&rdquo;. This was launched by EU Commissioner, David Byrne, last Friday. A fee is charged for the course and the booklet.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the work undertaken to date by the FSAI since it took over responsibility for the enforcement of food safety legislation. I am satisfied that the regulations are being consistently enforced. The audit strategy of the FSAI, the existence of the guides to good hygiene practice and the quality management system being introduced in the health board environmental health services will support further the uniform application of the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in recent times hospitals providing accident and emergency services have experienced increased activity. In the period December 1999 to March 2000, the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital experienced an increased demand for its services resulting in a 15% increase in admissions over the same period last year. The hospital has also experienced difficulties in discharging patients due to the shortage of long stay accommodation for elderly patients. I have been informed that the hospital has been working closely with the new Northern Area Health Board to secure as many long stay places as possible.</P>
      <P>In 1999, £200,000 was allocated to Beaumont Hospital for A&amp;E improvements and a further £240,000 was made available to the hospital in 2000. Within this funding, the hospital has undertaken a number of measures to improve systems for dealing with patients attending the A&amp;E department. A 24 hour triage system has been introduced to ensure that patients are seen in order of clinical need rather than in order of attendance. A GP liaison sister has been appointed to ensure a good quality integrated hospital/community service to patients who present in the A&amp;E department. The hospital has also used part of the resources allocated for A&amp;E services to purchase contract beds in nursing homes to alleviate the problem of step down accommodation. The hospital is currently introducing new clinics for patients presenting at the A&amp;E with minor strokes and chest pain. If appropriate these patients will be treated on an outpatient basis, thereby reducing their need for admission.</P>
      <P>From 1 March 2000, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is the statutory body with responsibility for all health services in the eastern region. While it is a matter for the board and management of the new authority to determine its own agenda, I have advised the authority to give high priority to a number of policy questions, including the efficient planning and delivery of accident and emergency services in the eastern region.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the new GMS guidelines on eligibility, recently issued, allowed no increases for those under 70 years of age which will result in a large number of medical card holders being excluded from the scheme.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. In this respect, the guidelines were last increased on 1 January 2000. These increases applied to all age groups. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families. On the basis that resources should be concentrated on those most in need the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999 with the normal guidelines being increased by one-third. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. This measure is additional to the normal increase in guidelines which are revised annually in line with the consumer price index and apply to all age categories.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <P>In a population of more than one million medical card holders it is to be expected that some will be unduly demanding and problematic and while such cases are undoubtedly difficult on an individual basis all the evidence suggests that the number of such patients is very small.</P>
      <P>While no formal guidelines have been issued by my Department, the matter of dealing with difficult or abusive medical card patients is one which the community care and primary care units in each health boards are best placed to deal with given their specialist local knowledge.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>PCR testing for the hepatitis C virus is currently performed on all blood donations collected by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. PCR testing for the hepatitis C virus represents a significant increase in safety and shortens the period between the time of infection of a donor and the time when the screening test for infection in the donor becomes positive, known as the window period of the infection. The typical length of the window period without PCR testing is ten to 14 weeks. Following introduction of PCR testing, this window period is reduced to approximately two weeks. Although this represents a considerable increase in safety, it does not reduce the risk of hepatitis C infection from blood transfusion to zero, and no technique is currently available anywhere that completely removes the risk of hepatitis C infection from blood transfusion.</P>
      <P>In the recent case in Germany I understand that a donor escaped detection through PCR testing because the donation was made at a very early stage in infection, before it was detectable even by the PCR test.</P>

      <P>These reports arise from a literature review of the effects of long working hours undertaken by the Irish Medical Organisation. The findings are consistent with those which have emerged from studies of other occupational groups who work in stressful environments. The issues which affect Irish junior doctors are being addressed in the context of the introduction of reduced working hours, better training prospects and a more structured career path.</P>

    <P>The multi-faceted nature of the issue of waiting lists was considered by the expert review group which reported to my predecessor in 1998. I am currently reviewing progress to date in the implementation of the wide-ranging measures of a short, medium and longer term nature recommended in that report. In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, I believe that there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available <Col N="626" /> capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. Taken together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of poor accessibility to certain services. I intend to address these issues and am confident of achieving real progress in the area of waiting lists and more importantly waiting times.</P>

      <P>It should also be noted that recruitment of personnel is carried out on an ongoing basis in most agencies, and the level of vacancies fluctuate accordingly.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined measles, mumps and rubella  &ndash; MMR &ndash; vaccine is available free of charge from general practitioners under the primary childhood immunisation scheme. There is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under the scheme. The information available to my Department is that separate measles and mumps vaccines are not available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to an alleged link between the MMR vaccine and the development of certain conditions or disorders, my Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is a very safe and effective one. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism and recently published studies in the UK and Europe have further confirmed this. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine.</P>
      <P>I would, therefore, strongly urge all parents to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which may be given from the age of 15 months and which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella. The importance of children having MMR vaccination has been highlighted by the significant increase in the number of measles cases, particularly in the Dublin area, since the beginning of the year. A number of the children involved have been seriously ill and have required hospitalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer strategy which was published in November 1996 and followed in March 1997 by a three year action plan for its implementation, identified two principle objectives: to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective <Col N="631" /> service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the implementation of the strategy in 1997, £40 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the development of cancer services nationally. This investment has resulted in additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.</P>
    <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel including for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology, technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service.</P>
    <P>Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the national cancer strategy recommended that radiotherapy services should be provided from two supra regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra regional centre at Galway should be kept under review. I am pleased to report that this Government acted quickly in assessing that case and took the decision to provide a service at Galway at an estimated cost of £10 million. The radiotherapy service there will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. This is currently out to tender with a view to construction work commencing in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, the existing services available have also been benefiting from a major injection of resources. I recently announced an important investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork University Hospital, with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St Luke's and St Anne's Hospital opened in June 1998, having undergone a major redevelopment funded by a capital investment of over £20 million. Last year, two additional consultant radiotherapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services there. I have recently established an expert group to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services in this country.</P>
    <P>Chemotherapy is administered subject to the guidelines issues by my Department's, guidelines <Col N="632" /> for the safe administration of cytotoxic medical preparations. Chemotherapy services are widely available to patients requiring the service in each health board area in the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy of my commitment to the further development of cancer services in this country.</P>

      <P>The identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department is a matter for the management of each health agency. Current personnel policy for the health service provides that health agencies may fill non-consultant replacement posts without recourse to the Department. For this reason, the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the numbers employed in an acting or temporary capacity is not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also the case that the nature of the service to be provided &ndash; 24 hour, 365 days continuous care, and the seasonal requirements placed upon it &ndash; mean that health agencies must be able to respond when absences due to such factors as sick leave, maternity leave and holidays occur. Increased staffing can also be required at particular times of the year, e.g., winter, periods of increased activity, waiting list initiative, and acci<Col N="634" /> dent and emergency pressures. The increased work load in these instances is also provided by the employment of temporary workers. For these reasons the number of staff working in an acting capacity at any one time varies according to changing needs.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the homeless are a high risk group in relation to a number of health conditions, including mental illness. While homeless people would typically have access to the full range of health services without charge, for a variety of reasons, their take-up of services is significantly lower than the general public.</P>
      <P>Current mental health policy, including the provision of care to the homeless mentally ill, is based on the recommendations contained in the report Planning for the Future, which was published in 1984. The report recommended that psychiatric care should be primarily community oriented. Successive Governments have pursued this policy and the move from an institutional to a community based setting has resulted in many improvements in our mental health services. It is the intention to continue to develop community based services encompassing the provision of specialised services for at risk groups including homeless people with mental health problems.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, a specific mental health programme for the homeless is in place with residential and day facilities together with an outreach programme. Resources have been made available by my Department to the authority, in the current year, to enable an additional consultant psychiatrist led multi-disciplinary team to be put in place to deal specifically with the needs of homeless people who are mentally ill.</P>

Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993, approximately £33 million has been provided for the implementation of the reports recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This has resulted in major improvements in the service including: the training of ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service falls to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement appropriately other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards currently provide 63 places for non-offenidng children in need of special care or protection.</P>
      <P>Placements in each health board area as follows. Eastern Regional Health Authority, 12; Midland Health Board, 3; Mid-Western Health Board, 4; North-Eastern Health Board, 6; North-Western Health Board, 3; South-Eastern Health Board, 17; Southern Health Board, 18; Western Health Board, 0.</P>
      <P>These include places in special care and high support units, as well as special high support packages developed for individual children. The occupancy rate varies in accordance with the requirements that health boards have to respond to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> Plans are under way to develop additional places nationally as follows: &ndash; In the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area, the construction of a special care unit providing 24 places at Ballydowd, Lucan commenced in January 1999. It is anticipated that this unit will open in the summer of this year. The development of a 24 bed high support unit which will be built at Portrance is at tender stage. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001. The Midland Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board, the North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. a site has been acquired and a project manager and a project group has been put in place to develop the proposal.</P>
    <P>Places being developed in the other boards are as follows: 20 high support places &ndash; four of which are already in place on an interim basis &ndash; and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board; three high support places in the South-Eastern Health Board; five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a secure facility for girls in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available during 2000 and 2001. My Department has conveyed approval to proceed with all of these developments and has provided the required funding.</P>
    <P>The senior managers resource group comprising representatives from each of the health boards and my Department was established in October 1998. The Government recognises that the Children Act, 1908, which governs the current juvenile justice system needs to be reformed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Children Bill, 1999, is currently before the House. This Bill, when enacted, will repeal the Children Act, 1908, in its entirety and will set out a blueprint for a new juvenile justice system. It will, <i>inter alia, </i>empower the health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to provide special care or protection for a non-offending child whose behaviour poses a real and substantial risk to his or her health, safety, development and welfare. It will also raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12. The Bill also establishes for the first time on a statutory basis the family welfare conference which will enable health boards to intervene with other agencies at an early stage in relation to children who need special care and protection or where a child is before a court charged with an offence and the court deems it appropriate to adjourn proceedings and refer the child to the health board.</P>
    <P>While it would not necessarily be appropriate in the case of a child in need of special care or protection who acts in contravention of the law to ignore the criminal implications of such behaviour, these and the other measures set out in the Children Bill, 1999, when enacted, will allow courts a wide range of options when dealing with such children. It should also be noted that section <Col N="640" /> 77 of the Bill establishes the principle that criminal proceedings shall not be used solely to provide any assistance or services needed to care for or protect a child.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, proposes to restrict the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála to persons who make submissions or observations to the planning authority on the initial planning application. In his letter, Mr. Spencer expressed concern about this limitation for persons who did not object to a planning application because they were satisfied with the original proposal, but who feel adversely affected by changes to the development required by conditions imposed by the planning authority in the final decision. It is my intention, in response to this concern which was also raised by Senators when debating the Bill, to introduce an amendment to the Bill on Dáil Committee Stage. The amendment will enable An Bord Pleanála to accept an appeal from a person holding an interest in adjoining land which would be adversely affected by changes to the development required by conditions imposed on the planning permission by the planning authority.</P>

      <P>Amending regulations are at present being prepared by my Department to implement the provisions of Directive 96/53/EC regarding maximum weights for goods vehicles in use on international journeys. The regulations will allow for a maximum overall weight of up to 44 tonnes in such circumstances depending on vehicle characteristics and size. I will also consider in this context the requirements applicable to journeys within the State, having regard to the protection of infrastructure, including older stone bridges.</P>
      <P>Some 88 fixed weighbridges are at present designated by road authorities throughout the country for the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts. These are supplemented by a number of mobile weighbridges operated by the Garda on road traffic duties.</P>
      <P>Since 1963 it has been an offence under the Road Traffic Acts for an owner or operator to exceed the specified weight limits. Section 17 of the Road Transport Act, 1999, extends this provision to the consignor of a load being carried by a vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a range of grant schemes and programmes which concentrate on a wide range of supports for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs. To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. Grants are not available from my Department towards services that are deemed the responsibility of other Departments or statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations operated by my Department provides once-off grants for voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas, towards renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications, research or other special projects. The types of groups eligible for funding under this scheme are community development and area development organisations, family support groups, welfare rights and information groups, mutual support and self-help organisations and co-ordinating and umbrella organisations.</P>
      <P>All groups seeking funding under this and other grant schemes operated by my Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department does not distinguish between disability groups and other groups but takes account of the extent to which each group, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that the Dublin North regional office of my Department received two applications for funding from the group indicated in the Deputy's question. As a large number of applications have been received and will take <Col N="646" /> time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to the group under this year's schemes. However, my Department will be in touch with the group in due course regarding its applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Waiting days have been a feature of the disability benefit scheme since its inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries. The principal reason for the application of a three waiting day period is to avoid the disproportionately high administrative costs which would be involved in processing disability benefit claims of very short duration. As many employers have occupational sick pay arrangements which provide compensation for employees for short spells of incapacity, the waiting day rule also serves to reduce the overlap between State and occupational sick pay provision. In addition, it can reasonably be expected that most workers would be able to absorb the loss of the first three days earnings without suffering undue hardship. However, where a person has a subsequent spell of incapacity in quick succession, then the three waiting day rule is waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers are not generally left without any financial support during the three waiting day period. Where a person has no recourse to occupational sick pay and has no other income, supplementary welfare allowance can be paid. While I have no plans to amend the three day waiting period for disability benefit purposes, my <Col N="647" /> Department will continue to keep the operation of this rule under review.</P>

      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of claimants in receipt of smallholder's unemployment assistance on 31 March 1999 was 6,494. The average payment on that date is not available, but on 31 December 1998 it was £74.60 per week. This figure is unlikely to have changed significantly in the period January to March 1999.</P>
      <P>On 31 March 2000 there were 7,568 farm assist claims in payment, receiving on average £75.85 per week. The average payment to 431 claimants still in receipt of smallholder's unemployment assistance is £75.43. Former smallholders, who are now in receipt of farm assist, are receiving on average £83.82 per week, an increase of £9 per week compared with smallholder's unemployment assistance at the end of 1998. New applicants for farm assist are receiving an average payment of £59 per week.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, makes a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. The child related disregards are being increased from £100 for the first two children and £200 for each subsequent qualified child to £200 and £300 respectively. Furthermore, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, will be taken into account. There will also be changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded, and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore. These changes will be effective from October 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if she will provide funding for South Dublin County Council for the restoration and development of the courtyards and outbuildings adjacent to Rathfarnham Castle; and the plans, if any, for the further restoration of the castle and its grounds.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the restoration and future use of the outbuildings at Rathfarnham Castle, first, from the point of view of their close relationship with the castle itself and, second, because they are protected by a preservation order, 1986, and were designated as a national monument with the castle in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been in regular contact with South Dublin County Council to try to agree a plan for this site which is acceptable to all concerned. As the Deputy is already aware, a contentious proposal for a hotel development to which my Department lodged an objection was refused planning permission. As a prerequisite to any development on site, my Department requested South Dublin County Council to engage a consultant to undertake an historical and condition report on the outbuildings to include archaeolog<Col N="650" /> ical data. This recently completed report is being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>I understand the Heritage Council has agreed to provide 50% of the funding necessary to restore the roof of the outbuildings. As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department does not have funds available to cover the preservation of national monuments other than those in the ownership or guardianship of the State. Given the unique circumstances pertaining to Rathfarnham Castle, I am considering what further assistance might be available in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department supported an application by South Dublin County Council to the National Millennium Committee for funding in the order of £1.82 million for the provision of a theatre and craft units in the outbuildings, the restoration of the Seismograph House, Turner Conservatory, and development of the walled garden and courtyards. Only £30,000 was forthcoming from the National Millennium Committee towards the cost of this proposal and South Dublin County Council, in consultation with my Department, has decided to use the £30,000 for the restoration of the Seismograph House. Given that adequate funding is not available to undertake a major scheme of restoration and conservation, further consultation with all relevant parties is necessary before a final decision can be reached on the future of these buildings.</P>
    <P>With regard to Rathfarnham Castle itself, I am pleased to advise that the final phase of works under the 1994-99 EU Operational Programme for Tourism is under way and practically complete. This phase of works involves mainly improvement works to the interior of the castle, including restoration of the ballroom to its 18th century proportions and provision of a staircase in the north east tower. Some appropriate furnishings and art works have also recently been acquired and will be on display when the castle reopens.</P>
    <P>With completion of this phase of works, my Department will have achieved its major objectives but further restoration of the castle will be an ongoing process to be undertaken as Exchequer resources permit. The important part is that the essential work of conserving the building has been completed, thus ensuring the future of this important castle.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been allocated £250 million under the national development plan for expenditure on child care in the period 2000 to 2006. The objectives of the equal opportunities child care programme are to increase the numbers of child care places and facilities available in Ireland and to improve the quality of child care facilities. The programme will have a number of different strands designed to achieve these objectives and will include a capital grants scheme for self-employed child care providers catering for up to 20 child care places. The criteria and the eligibility requirements for the measures being provided under the programme are being developed. The application forms and guidelines for these initiatives are at the design stage and will shortly be going to print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to promote the availability of grants under the programme, including the grants scheme for self-employed child care providers, at the end of April. Following promotion of these schemes, application forms and guidelines will be available from my Department's equal opportunities child care section.

    <P>&ldquo;(3) where an applicant for the grant of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle is duly made, the Commissioner shall grant the licence if he is satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence to drive small public service vehicles; has an adequate knowledge of general traffic regulations, the area in which he/she proposes to make his/her services available as a driver of a small public service vehicles and of local traffic and parking regulations applying to that area, the regulations relating to small public service vehicles; has not been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would render him unsuitable to hold a licence to drive small public service vehicles; in the case of an applicant who is not the holder of a valid subsisting <Col N="655" /> licence to drive small public service vehicles, holds at the time of the application a driving licence without endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to the commencement this year of an initial learning phase of equality proofing, the core elements of which will reflect the recommendations contained in the Partnership 2000 Report on Equality Proofing and to the participation of the groups named in the Employment Equality Act, 1998 in that process.</P>
      <P>The equality proofing report was developed from research commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to assist with the implementation of a commitment at paragraph 5.2 of Partnership 2000 to the strengthening of administrative procedures for equality proofing in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy. A Partnership 2000 working group comprising representatives of the social partners, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Equality Authority and the Combat Poverty Agency advised on the report. My Department presented the equality proofing report to Partnership 2000 in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report advocates the introduction of a wide ranging system of equality proofing to assess the impact of policy on the nine categories identified in equality legislation, i.e. gender, race, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status, religion, disability and membership of the Traveller community. In view of the complexity of equality proofing, the report recommends a &ldquo;learning phase&rdquo; during the period 2000-2003 <Col N="657" /> where experience on equality proofing covering the nine categories identified in equality legislation would be developed in a number of specific policy areas.</P>
    <P>The NESF have defined equality proofing as the development of an integrated and systematic approach to ensure that discriminated and marginalised groups are provided with the necessary means and resources to participate in society as equal citizens'. Participation by the relevant target groups in equality proofing is a vital part of the process enabling consultative inputs from categories who experience discrimination with the objective of taking their concerns into account in the development of policy. Participation by the relevant target groups can also compensate for inadequate data in relation to the categories concerned.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms to give effect to commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness have yet to be decided and will be worked out in consultation with all parties to the agreement. As indicated in the report, participation in the working group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the equality proofing report will comprise relevant Government Departments, the Equality Authority, the Combat Poverty Agency, and the four pillars of social partnership. The interests of the individual groups will be represented by the social partners and by the Equality Authority. It is the intention that the categories named in the equality legislation will be facilitated in participating in the process of equality proofing the range of initiatives proposed in the report.</P>

      <P>While there have been some recruitment and retention problems in relation to health care staff in the prisons, it is not true to say that large numbers of doctors are abandoning their work in the Prisons Service. The annual reports of the Director of Prison Medical Services, which have been made available under the Freedom of Information Act, have outlined in some detail the various difficulties in recruitment that exist. Given that Irish health care staff have a wide range of employment options at present, it is understandably difficult to attract medical people to work in what is considered a difficult working environment.</P>
      <P>I established a group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services last November. The group will be looking at all of the issues involved, including those relating to the recruitment and retention of medical staff. As soon as the group reports to me, I will give early consideration to any recommendation it makes in this general area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>The review group referred to by the Deputy was set up to carry out an independent review of prison health care services.</P>
      <P>The review body is under the chairmanship of Mr. John Olden, Second Vice-President of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhumane, and Degrading Treatment of Persons in Custody, and former Secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>The membership of the review group consists of representatives of: Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Department of Health and Children; Department of Finance; Director of Prison Medical Services; a senior prison governor; a nominee of the Irish College of General Practitioners; a nominee of the Royal College of Psychiatrists; a nominee of an Bord Altrainais; a nominee of the Pharmaceutical Society; a nominee of the Irish Dental Council.</P>
      <P>Although the Irish Prison Doctors Association as a group are not officially represented on the review body, the chairman of the association is a member of the review body as the representative of the Irish College of General Practitioners. In addition, the Director of Prison Medical Services has approached all prison doctors and psychiatrists individually and invited them to make submissions to the group.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all areas of health care are adequately represented on the group. The group has, however, invited submissions from the general public as well as from special interest groups in relation to its review. The group would, of course, particularly welcome a submission from the Irish Prison Doctors Association in view of the important role of prison doctors in the provision of prison health care.</P>
      <P>This review will obviously take some time to complete. I expect to have a report from the group by summer 2001. It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible.</P>

For that reason, I do not propose to depart from the normal practice of not disclosing the precise numbers and grades of those expressing an interest in transferring, lest those who have expressed such a wish be identified.</P>

      <P>In theory all staff are eligible for promotion subject to considerations such as the conditions relating to the specific job requirements, e.g., legal qualifications, given experience or length of service, etc. These factors are considered at the date of the competition in respect of officers making an application for promotion.</P>
      <P>Staff in Waterford can only be accommodated with a move to Dublin in accordance with the exigencies of providing a service in both locations. I should add that staff who went to Waterford on promotion for decentralisation were required to remain a minimum of three years in Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 304 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The pay scales of caretakers employed under this scheme are linked to those of caretakers in vocational schools. Caretakers who are employed under this scheme will, of course, benefit from the pay increases that have been agreed in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools have, up to now, been receiving grants of £15 per pupil, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 in respect of caretaking services.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita </i>grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which caretaking services are provided. Caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. The question of the application of the national agreements in these cases, including the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is a matter to be resolved between the management authorities of the schools and the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards caretaking services under this scheme. In addition, I have increased the rate of grant by 33% to £20 per pupil. This will also result in the maximum grant payable to schools increasing from £7,500 to £10,000. My Department is currently making <Col N="665" /> arrangements for the issue of these grants to schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, with effect from January 2001, all primary schools will become eligible for grant assistance under this scheme. My Department is currently finalising a circular on this matter and this will be issued to all schools within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged in discussions with the partners in education including the INTO in relation to the above arrangements and in relation to the question of future improvements in the provision for caretaking services at primary level.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates additional teaching resources to second level schools to cater for the educational needs of visually impaired students. Applications are submitted by the authorities of the individual schools at which the students attend. The applications are referred to the psychological service for a report and recommendation. Each case is considered on its individual merits.</P>
      <P>Visually impaired students also have access to the visiting teacher service for children with certain disabilities. The visiting teacher service provides support for the children in question and their families and also advises schools on best ways of meeting their special learning needs.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second-level schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties, including visual impairment. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. Computer equipment and software are items that may be provided. Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. The equipment remains the property of the school.</P>
      <P>The supports provided to visually impaired students will be kept under review in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>As a first step leading to the implementation of the revised primary science curriculum, all teachers have been issued with copies of both the curriculum statement and the teacher guidelines in science. These books constitute a most important resource for teachers who wish to introduce the subject to their classes. The teacher guidelines include detailed suggestions and recommendations as to how the various topics in the programme might best be approached with pupils of primary age. They set out comprehensive guidelines on materials and methodologies in all the curricular strands and incorporate in all almost 50 exemplars of good practice. By way of concrete support for the expansion of science teaching, my Department last October paid out an approximate total of £1.75 million in the form of science grants to primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In-career provision for science will be a major component of the primary curriculum support programme for the school-year 2000-01 and details of this programme are currently being finalised. This will involve the appointment of trainers and the release of all primary teachers to <Col N="669" /> attend seminars in the course of the year. In addition to these seminars, many of the education centres and some third level colleges also plan to provide courses in primary science during the current year.</P>
    <P>I recently launched the science bus at Dublin City University which represents an additional innovative strand to the supports already being provided and which will undoubtedly appeal to pupils in senior primary classes.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a network of science centres throughout the country has been put as a proposal to my Department by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation.

      <P>The review of the science subjects, agricultural science, biology, chemistry and physics at leaving certificate level commenced between 1991 <Col N="671" /> and 1992. The revised syllabuses were approved by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the mid 1990s but implementation was delayed because the issue of how best to assess practical and process skills in the sciences was unresolved. In the latter context a feasibility study in physics and chemistry and subsequent analysis of its findings took place between 1996 and 1999.</P>
      <P>The current status of the revised syllabuses in these subjects is as follows: revised syllabuses in chemistry and physics will be introduced in schools in September 2000; a support service has been in place since September 1999 to provide professional support for schools and teachers in this task. There will be particular emphasis on the practical skills for the new syllabi; a resource-enhancement programme is under way which aims at the provision of a base-level of resources in all schools; the possibility of introducing an effective means of assessment of practical and process skills within the sciences will continue to be explored by my Department.</P>
      <P>The NCCA has recommended that the revised syllabuses for agricultural science and biology be introduced to schools in September 2001.</P>
      <P>The review of the combined physics-chemistry subject at leaving certificate level commenced in the 1996. The NCCA has approved a draft syllabus for a reconfiguration of this subject and that syllabus will be the subject of a public consultation process to commence this month.</P>
      <P>At junior certificate level a review of the subject science commenced in 1998. The NCCA is in the process of completing work on that revision in consultation with the educational partners.</P>

Data are not readily available to provide the more detailed information requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated recently in reply to another parliamentary question in this area that, as part of a wide-ranging initiative introduced by my Department in March last year in the areas of physics and chemistry, a comprehensive in-service and support programme for the teachers in those leaving certificate subjects is being implemented at present. This programme started in the autumn 1999 and is due to continue for three years until the end of the school-year 2001-2002. The plan is <Col N="672" /> to provide two and a half days for each leaving certificate teacher concerned in the current school year and this will include practical experience. Further training will be provided in the remaining years of the programme for these teachers, including practical experience, to meet identified needs.</P>
    <P>Further training for teachers in the areas in question will be provided in the context of other revised syllabuses being developed at present by the NCCA.</P>

      <P>At present, of the total of 752 schools at second level, 211 schools have disadvantaged status.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Educational Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16% of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17% of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the position of the school in question will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the stay in school retention initiative at second level the position is that the Initiative will provide funding to targeted schools <Col N="673" /> on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. The intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative are multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools and agreed with the Department. These are to provide for a range of specific measures directed at the particular needs of individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention up to the end of the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>Fifty eight schools are participating in the first phase of the initiative and it is intended to invite further schools to participate in the second phase during 2000.</P>
    <P>The school in question will receive full consideration when schools are being invited to participate in the second phase of the initiative.</P>

      <P>The oral Irish part of this examination has, since April 1999, been taped for the purposes of facilitating re-checks by unsuccessful candidates. The person referred to by the Deputy has requested access to the tapes of her oral examination from the April and October sittings of the exam, in which she was unsuccessful on both occasions. My Department has written to the person and explained that there is a difficulty in locating the tape of her October oral Irish examination but that the tape of the April examination, and examiner's notes in relation to the October examination, will be made available to her. A departmental inspector will also be available to the person to offer advice on any aspect of the oral Irish examination.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, efforts are continuing within my Department to locate the tape in question. I would add, however, that there is no question of the person not having been marked for her oral Irish examination. The examiner would have marked the person on the date of the examination and the recording of the examination is not used, or never has been used, for that purpose.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Currently there are approximately 450 secretaries and caretakers employed under this scheme. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional <i>per capita </i>grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme, qualifying schools have, up to now, been receiving grants of £30 per pupil, £15 per pupil in respect of each service, subject to a maximum grant of £15,000, maximum of £7,500 in respect of each service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita </i>grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my <Col N="678" /> Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. In addition I have increased the rates of grant from by 33% to £40 per pupil. This has also resulted in the maximum grant payable to schools under this scheme increasing from £15,000 to £20,000. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issue of these grants to schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, with effect from January 2001, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>The improvements outlined above mean that, for the first time, all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. My Department is currently finalising a circular on this matter and this will be issued to schools within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>The stay in school retention initiative at second level will provide funding to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. The intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative are multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools and agreed with the Department. These are to provide for a range of specific measures directed at the particular needs of individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention up to the end of the senior cycle.</P>
      <P>Some 58 schools are participating in the first phase of the initiative and it is intended to invite a further selection of schools to participate in the second phase during 2000.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the school in question will receive full consideration when schools are being invited to participate in the second phase of the initiative.</P>

      <P>It is anticipated that the report on the funding of second level schools will be published within the next month.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the demands for increased funding by voluntary secondary schools. Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the level of support for voluntary secondary schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of voluntary secondary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>From information supplied by the central applications office, the number of first preferences for medicine this year is currently 1,621 which can be compared to a final number of first preferences last year of 1,910. Even with the decline in the number of first preferences, the ratio of first preferences to places accepted will be 5:1, on the basis of 323 acceptances in 1999. As the Deputy will be aware, the demand for medical places results in the high points requirements attaching to such places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on the Points System con<Col N="682" /> sidered the issue of courses that require high points for entry. It accepted that in the case of some professional courses, especially those attracting high unit costs to the State, there is a need to ensure relativity between the number of students admitted to courses and the available employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>In subjects where the number of places is capped, for example medicine, the commission recommended that there should be regular review involving open and transparent decision making processes. On the wider issue of healthcare courses generally, the commission recommended that the key bodies involved set up a committee to explore the possibility of a preliminary third level course in life sciences followed by further study in a particular healthcare discipline.</P>

      <P>Details of the current capacity and projected capacity, after completion of my Department's development plans for Oberstown Boys Centre and the other young offender centres, are outlined in the following table. The other detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to Oberstown Boys Centre is currently being compiled in my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>From time to time, difficulties arise accommodating individual children on the first date on which placement is sought in any particular unit due to pressure on places on a given day. In general, the child in these circumstances is either subsequently placed in that unit or in one of the other facilities as an alternative to, or pending the availability of, a place in the original unit of preference. Plans for major re-development and enhancement of the range of facilities under my Department, together with the development of a significant number of high support units and special care units and other services by the health boards, seek to broaden the range of facilities and services available for &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These developments of the schools under the <Col N="683" /> aegis of my Department will result in a net increase in the provision for young offenders of 30 places. The new and replacement facilities are being designed to allow for maximum flexibility in the use of the places to cater for fluctuating demand among the different categories in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The Children Bill, 1999, along with providing for the above mentioned facilities, also provides for a wide range of non-custodial options to be available for such children. The Bill also makes provision for the establishment of a residential services board which will have a co-ordinating role to help ensure that there is an appropriate response to meet the care needs of these children.</P>
