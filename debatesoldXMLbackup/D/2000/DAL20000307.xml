      <Quest>the reason gardaí in County Donegal, who are the subject of an inquiry into alleged garda misconduct surrounding the planting of hoax bombs and interfering with arms finds and the mishandling of an investigation into the death of an individual, have not been transferred or suspended on pay pending finalisation of the inquiry by senior gardaí; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that investigations led by an Assistant Commissioner into all aspects of the allegations are still continuing. This is a very complex investigation involving a number of allegations. The Garda authorities have informed me that, arising from the facts established to date, one member has been suspended. A Garda superintendent has moved voluntarily from the divisional headquarters to a district headquarters in Donegal for the duration of the investigation so that there cannot be any suggestion of his position impacting on the independence of the investigation. This should not, incidentally, be confused with disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that there are obvious constraints on what I can say on the matter while the investigation is continuing. However, I have been advised by the Garda authorities that considerable progress has been made. The investigating team has been in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions and it is hopeful of finalising aspects of the investigation in the next six to eight weeks. Appropriate files will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

        <b>: </b>Why were the gardaí, who were the subject of the investigation, not transferred to some other Garda station or suspended on pay? Given that they are still <i>in situ</i> in positions of authority, there is considerable disquiet about alleged intimidation and threats to people to withdraw their statements.</P>

      <P>The power of suspension in any given case is vested in the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and would normally arise where he believes it is warranted. The criterion normally used is that if an allegation was found to be correct, it would result in the dismissal of the individual concerned from the force. It is an operational matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, not one for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform nor one in which I may interfere.</P>
      <P>With regard to the allegations that have been made, as I stated, an investigation is under way, which we anticipate should be completed in the next six to eight weeks, following which matters will be dealt with as appropriate.</P>

        <b>: </b>Is it the same group of gardaí that is being investigated about the two matters, the alleged planting of hoax bombs and the mishandling of the murder investigation? Will the Minister confirm reports in today's<i> The Examiner</i> that the gardaí who are the subject of the investigation are to be arrested shortly and charged?

      <P>I will not prejudge the outcome of the inquiry, but the Garda is investigating a number of allegations made in respect of <Col N="1327" /> the behaviour of a certain number of gardaí in the Donegal division. These investigations relate to the method of the investigation of crime and include an allegation that bomb making material had been planted so the gardaí could claim credit for finding it and those allegations, as I told Deputy Higgins, are being investigated. I anticipate we should have the result of those inquiries in the next six to eight weeks. I assure the Deputy, without prejudging the issue or giving a commitment to a public or any other kind of inquiry, that the appropriate action will be taken at that point.</P>

      <Quest>when audio-visual interview facilities will be generally available in Garda stations; if he will ensure that these facilities are available in advance of the introduction of planned legislation to provide for the extension of periods of detention and further restrictions on the right to silence; his views on the comments made in the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy that the introduction of this taping may affect detection rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6829/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the recommendations of the steering committee which had been established to examine and report on the feasibility of electronically recording Garda interviews with suspects at Garda stations, the Government has decided that a system of audio-video recording of such interviews should be introduced on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Implementation committees have been established at Garda and departmental level to plan and oversee the practical steps which must be taken in this regard. It is envisaged that facilities for video recording will be installed in approximately 150 Garda stations and that more than 300 interview rooms will need to be refurbished and fitted to facilitate audio-video recording. In addition, a major contract has to be placed for the purchase of the specialised audio-video equipment needed. A planned training programme for gardaí in the use of the new equipment and the procedures relating thereto, also needs to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I understand arrangements in relation to these matters are now well advanced and equipping of stations should be well advanced by the end of the year. I am satisfied audio-video recording will be generally available before the legislation to which the Deputy refers is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the possible effect on detection rates of the introduction of audio-video recording, I refer the Deputy to one of the findings of the steering committee which oversaw the pilot trials of electronic recording to the effect that inculpatory admissions were made by 69% of suspects interviewed in the pilot stations on tape, <Col N="1328" /> compared to 65% in the control stations where interviews were conducted in the traditional manner. This would suggest that audio/video recording should not occasion any reduction in detection rates.</P>
    <P>In his questions, the Deputy referred to my recent announcement that the Government has approved the drafting of a Criminal Justice Bill based on the recommendations of the expert group appointed to consider changes to the criminal law recommended in the Garda SMI report. Increased powers of detention and a further legislative restriction of the right to silence in relation to the more serious offences, are two of the measures to be addressed in the Bill. The Bill has only recently been sent to the parliamentary draftsman for drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a clear assurance to the House that the extension of periods of detention envisaged in the Criminal Justice Bill, 2000, which has yet to be presented to the House, will not be implemented until such time as a comprehensive national system of videotaping interviews is available &ndash; that is, in the 150 stations the Minister says it is his intention so to equip? May I have that stated as a matter of clear principle, please? </P>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's response that he does not agree with the statement in the Garda Síochána's corporate strategy &ndash; published, presumably, with the full authority of the Garda Síochána &ndash; that audio-visual interviewing will ensure that suspects' rights are seen to be protected but that it will have an adverse effect on the detection of crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Government to take advantage of the audio-video system. I assure the Deputy that the system will be in place prior to the legislation arising from the SMI report. That is my clear intention. With regard to the possibility of detection rates falling arising from the provision of audio-video facilities, it will be clear from the steering group's report that this should not be the case. In fact, the number of admissions that were made whilst the audio-video system was in use was higher by approximately 4% than the number made while the system was not being utilised. At least, that is what the pilot studies show at this point. The new powers with regard to detention and inferences from an individual's silence will relate to more serious offences normally carrying a period of imprisonment of ten years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that the position he has enunciated now, and which is also presumably the Government's position, is at variance with that stated in the Garda Síochána's corporate strategy? Does he agree with the many eminent legal personages who have said it is unacceptable in our democracy to have interviews without at least audio-taping them to ensure proper protection of the accused and of <Col N="1329" /> the gardaí? When will he ensure that an interview does not take place without such safeguards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact of life that long before this equipment became available, and even since it became available in the lifetime of the Government of which the Deputy was a member, there was no effort to provide audio-video facilities. That said, I intend to ensure that within approximately 12 months, the 150 Garda stations which have been identified will have this equipment up and running, which I envisage should be very successful. Clearly, it is the intention to ensure that the individual being questioned is protected and it is also important for the character of the garda involved that the equipment concerned come into use at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be well aware that policy is a matter for the Government. Obviously what the Garda Síochána says is taken on board when the Government makes policy decisions, as are the opinions of other vested interests. However, in the final analysis policy is a matter&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if he will invoke the powers conferred on him by section 15 of the Coroners Act, 1962, in view of letters of 4 July 1994 and 2 December 1994 from the then Attorney General to a coroner (details supplied) alleging the withholding of vital evidence concerning the deceased person's allergy to penicillin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Following careful consideration, a decision on this matter under section 15 of the 1962 Coroners Act was made by me in 1998 to the effect that it would not be appropriate for me to invoke my powers under this section in this case. The Deputy may recall that following representations made to me by him in May 1999 regarding this case I informed him of the results of my decision on 18 June 1999 and provided him with a copy of my letter to the applicant involved.</P>

        <b>: </b>Is the Minister aware that the autopsy report which the coroner had before him at the inquest stated in black and white that the deceased had an allergy to penicillin and that this allergy had been recorded in the hospital notes? Not alone did the coroner not bring this <Col N="1330" /> to the attention of the jury, but he listened to witness after witness from the hospital say that there was no record of the allergy. In view of the clear evidence in the autopsy report, which I have here, that there was a record in the hospital of this man's allergy, does the Minister accept the coroner was wrong in&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time this afternoon that Deputy Higgins has asked me to pass judgment on events that occurred outside this Chamber &ndash; it is not my function to do so. It is clear that my function in respect of this matter relates to section 15 of the Coroners Act, 1962, which only empowers me to remove a coroner from office when it can be clearly established that the coroner concerned is guilty of misconduct or neglect of duty, or is unfit for office or incapable of his or her duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity.</P>
      <P>This matter has been going on for a considerable period and has been dealt with by the High Court, which referred to the merits of the case. Mr. Justice Smyth, in his judgment of 30 January 1997 referred to the allegation that the jury did not hear the full evidence the coroner had in his possession. All I can say is that Mr. Justice Smyth said the allegation is not only &ldquo;not sustained&rdquo; but, on the evidence, is not sustainable. Of course I understand and empathise with the widow of the deceased, who is not happy with the inquest proceedings according to Deputy Higgins, but the Deputy will appreciate that the allegations have not been proven and that the good name and reputation of the coroner concerned must also be considered. In those circumstances it would clearly be improper for me to go further than I have done. I have outlined my powers in relation to this matter, and they are quite clear and explicit. If I were Deputy Higgins, I would desist from making allegations across the floor in a manner which indicate that he is disposed towards believing the same allegations.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details on the proposed spend of the £250 million child care package in the national development plan; his strategy in relation to child care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy that the £250 million investment in the development of child care service provision will be spread over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-06. The funding will be invested in a range of initiatives under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme aimed at increasing the quantity of child care places and improving the quality of child care services including capital grants to non-profit organisations and community groups to establish, upgrade or enhance child care facilities; staffing grants to non-profit organisations and community groups for child care personnel; capital grants for self-employed child care service providers catering for up to 20 child care places; supports for training initiatives; grants to enhance the services of the National Voluntary Child Care Organisations and grants towards the development of local child care networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently finalising the qualifying criteria for the capital and staffing grants. It is intended to promote these measures in the coming weeks in the national and local newspapers. Information guidelines and application forms will be available to coincide with the advertising campaign. The other funding initiatives will be promoted later in the year. It is intended that the application process will operate on an open-ended basis. My Department will also take the lead role in the co-ordination of child care across relevant Departments and agencies over the course of the National Development Plan. Structures are being established at national <Col N="1333" /> and local levels in this regard including: an interdepartmental &ldquo;synergies&rdquo; committee which is chaired by my Department to focus on co-operation and co-ordination between Government Departments and State agencies with a role in child care; a national co-ordinating child care committee, also chaired by my Department, to oversee the development of a child care infrastructure in an integrated manner throughout the country. Membership comprises representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sectors, including the social partners and the regional assemblies. The committee has met on three occasions to date. There will be county child care committees to advance child care service provision at local levels. Membership will comprise local representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sector, including providers and parents.</P>
    <P>My Department also availed of funding last year to develop a national child care census and database. The census will provide information on child populations and the level of group based child care service provision on a county by county basis. Reports on each county will be finalised in the coming months and weeks and these will provide vital information to inform future policy development. In recognition of the important role played by the national voluntary child care organisations, funding was made available in 1999 for Barnardos, National Children's Nurseries Association, Childminding Ireland (formerly National Childminding Association of Ireland), Irish Pre-schools and Playgroups Association, St. Nicholas Montessori Society of Ireland and An Comhchoiste Reamhscolaíochta Teoranta. It is intended that support for and involvement of the national voluntary child care organisations in developing child care infrastructure and policy will continue throughout the period of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The funding supports, in particular the structures established to co-ordinate child care service delivery, will help us to achieve a more effective and informed approach to future child care planning.</P>

      <P>My obvious objective is to increase the supply of child care across the country. We are a long way behind other developed jurisdictions regarding child care and we have much catching up to do. That is why we have obtained £250 million under the national development plan between now and 2006 to provide grants to enable more places to be made available and, of course, to train and provide staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us if he sees parents having a role in the context of a <Col N="1334" /> strategy on child care, or will he concentrate only on paid child care outside the home? The Minister must accept that in the case of most families the first option is that one or other parent looks after their own children during the early years. Would the Minister accept that funding should be provided to allow parents that choice? It is very often the first choice if financial circumstances permit. Would he agree with spending some of the funding on supporting parents who look after their own children, as happens in most other European countries, in terms of paid parental leave and other types of extended leave? I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Shortall is aware, the House passed the Parental Leave Act, 1998. It did not provide for paid leave but for unpaid leave. The whole question of parents' involvement is something to which I have given consideration. Deputy Shortall will agree there is no point in speaking about parents having any involvement unless the places are available and the first objective must be to make sure there is a sufficiency of places available. That is the first objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to parental involvement subsequently, there will be county child care committees under the structure we will set up. I envisage parents having a role in these child care committees. Grants will be available for non-profit making organisations to provide places and I will shortly advertise for people who will be self-employed and cater for 20 children or less to enable them to apply for grants. Deputy Shortall seems to be interested in what happens in the home itself and she seems to be suggesting that there should be a payment made to parents living in the home for minding children at home.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Flanagan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the average time lapse between the charging of a person on a charge of rape and the case coming to trial.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6928/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime of rape is tried in <Col N="1335" /> the Central Criminal Court, which is the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction. Following the charging of a person on a crime of rape, the papers are forwarded immediately to the Central Criminal Court. The current time lapse between the date when papers, including the Book of Evidence, are sent to the Central Criminal Court and the date that the case is listed for trial is 13 months. Cases now coming into the list to fix dates will be given a date in early April 2001.</P>
      <P>The primary reason for this is the huge increase in the number of rape cases being dealt with by the Central Criminal Court. In 1996, 48 rape cases were dealt with, while in 1999 this figure had risen by 104% to 98. The overall number of rape cases received by the court rose by 170% in the same period, up from 48 to 130.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, other factors which can have an influence on or contribute to delays in cases reaching court such as the availability of witnesses, prosecution and defence counsels, and the complexity of cases.</P>
      <P>Having said all of that, I am still not satisfied that a waiting period of 13 months should apply, given the gravity of the crime of rape. I have taken action, therefore, to address the problem. First, I recently obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional High Court judge, who took up duty last month. This will enable the President of the High Court, who is responsible for the listing and allocation of cases, to address the problem of delays to the extent that they may be attributable to the shortage of judges. In this connection, I wish to point out that when the two current vacancies, which arose recently on the High Court bench, are filled in the coming weeks, the court will have its full statutory complement of 26 judges.</P>
      <P>The second step I have taken is to ask the chief executive of the Courts Service to conduct a specific analysis of the causes of delays in the Central Criminal Court with a view to identifying a precise set of measures in the shortest possible time to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged in his reply that the situation in the criminal law courts with regard to rape trials is entirely unsatisfactory. As the Minister said, the average wait is over 12 months. At best, his response has been tardy. Will the Minister confirm that the new judge who has been appointed will be assigned to deal exclusively with rape cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is more aware than most that the listing and designation of judges is a matter for the President of the High Court. I am certain that the president will recognise the problem that exists in the Central Criminal Court at present, which has been identified by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that rape cases were <Col N="1336" /> previously dealt with in the circuit criminal courts. The then Minister for Justice, former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, felt the crime was so serious that it should be dealt with in the Central Criminal Court. Moving the cases to that court has inevitably led to a greater degree of delay than normally would have been expected. However, the significant increase in the number of these types of crimes coming before the Central Criminal Court is an important factor.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases before the court increased from 73 in 1996 to 163 in 1999. This was an increase of 170%, while the number of rape cases increased from 48 to 130, which was an increase of 104%. The number of cases disposed of by the court also increased from a total of 71 in 1996 to 127 in 1999. The number of rape cases disposed of in 1996 amounted to 48. This number increased in 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to give an exhaustive reason for the time lapse but, in addition to the increases in the workload, I point out to Deputy Flanagan that the complexity of particular cases can be a contributory factor. As the Deputy is aware, it is impossible to foretell the length of a given trial. For example, cases with an equal number of witnesses may include different issues to be considered by the court and the trial length can be different. I obtained approval for the appointment of an additional High Court judge, who took up duty last month. The complement of the court will be increased to 26, which is its full complement. I am certain that this will have an effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the shambles which obtains in this area, does the Minister accept that a meeting between him and the President of the High Court is essential to ensure this matter is addressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, amends the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, by inserting a new section into the 1977 Act, which creates a new offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply and which came into force on 26 May, 1999.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of persons charged with this offence to date is 26. Nineteen of these cases are pending and have not yet been dealt with by the courts, and in one case the person charged has since died.</P>
      <P>Six cases have been dealt with. A sentence of four years was imposed in three cases, five years in one case, seven years in one case and seven and a half years in the remaining case.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that under the legislation a court is entitled to depart from the imposition of a minimum sentence in exceptional and specific circumstances. Factors to which the court may have regard, in deciding on these circumstances, include whether the person pleaded guilty, taking account of the stage at which such an intention was indicated and the circumstances surrounding the indication, and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that it is a matter for the courts to decide if the exceptional and specific circumstances provided for in the Act exist in any particular case. It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to comment on court decisions in this respect.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister recall when he published the Criminal Justice Bill in 1997, which was debated at length in both Houses, he made a meal of the central feature of the Bill &ndash; a ten year jail sentence for the possession of drugs worth £10,000 or more? We warned him it would not work. The impression was given that this was the iron fisted approach and that it would clear the streets of drugs. Will he acknowledge that a mere two convictions as a result of his<i> magnum opus</i> is evidence that we were right, he was wrong and what he was doing was using buzz words, clichés and rhetoric?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has a pench<Col N="1338" /> ant for repeating those clichés. It seems he did not listen to my reply. The legislation provides that there are exceptional circumstances the court can invoke. The Act has been in force since 26 May 1999 and there have been very few cases before the courts so far under the provisions of that legislation. I am satisfied &ndash; and I am sure Deputy Higgins will not be surprised &ndash; the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, will be seen as an effective mechanism for dealing with serious drug dealing and trafficking offences. Up to the passage of that legislation, under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, the courts could impose up to life imprisonment but there was no mandatory sentence. There is a mandatory sentence now which can be avoided only if the court is&mdash;</P>

      <P>The training of judges is a matter for the Judiciary. However, if it is established that sentences of ten years are not being imposed for reasons connected with defects in the legislation, I will move to remedy such defects.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, indictable crime statistics can be found in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details the crime statistics for 1998. While Garda crime statistics for 1999 have not yet been formally published, I am informed by the Garda authorities that so far this year, from 1 January to 3 March, ten murders have been recorded, six of which have been detected. This compares with six murders during the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>For the same period in 2000, two cases of manslaughter have been recorded, both of which were detected and during the corresponding period in 1999 two cases of manslaughter were also recorded. I would obviously be concerned about any increase in violent death but I am satisfied that the current arrangements for the investigation of cases of murder and manslaughter are satisfactory and I am informed by the Garda authorities that all such crimes are investigated to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to armed robberies the available statistics indicate a significant decrease overall in armed crime in recent years, with the level for 1998 at approximately 40% of the 1995 level. The figure for armed robberies has gone up, however, in the early part of this year. I am informed that 57 armed robberies have been recorded to date this year as compared to 24 for the same period last year. These figures are provisional and liable <Col N="1341" /> to change. The statistics also show that the detection rate over these years has risen from 28% in 1995 to 40% in 1998. Naturally I am concerned about all forms of armed crime and have spoken to the Garda Commissioner about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he has put in place an investigation process whereby members of the national bureau of criminal investigation with local district units combined their efforts to tackle the problem of armed robbery. This has met with success in solving a number of such robberies with the result that a number of persons are before the courts with a further number serving lengthy sentences. I also understand that a number of files are with the law officers.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, for purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and to ensure the number of Garda personnel is increased. Never in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme which will ensure those guilty of serious offences will serve their sentences and enable me, as I announced last weekend, to put in place from 15 May all the provisions of the Bail Act.</P>

      <P>This House will appreciate that, for obvious reasons, it is not my practice &ndash; nor was it that of my predecessors &ndash; to comment on the interception of communications other than to confirm that such interception is governed by the provisions of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993. The operation of the Act is kept under review by the President of the High <Col N="1344" /> Court, who is the designated judge for that purpose under section 8 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The newspaper article referred to in the question appears to have been based on material contained in my Department's Progress Report on its Strategy Statement, 1998-2000, a copy of which was passed to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights in August 1999, and which was subsequently forwarded to the Library in September 1999 and also posted on the Department's Internet site.</P>
      <P>What is at issue is simply the provision of updated technical equipment. It would not be appropriate to comment on the capability and intended usage of this equipment except to confirm that its usage will obviously be within the terms of the 1993 Act. It is estimated that the capital costs on the Garda Vote will be of the order of £850,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position with the prison at Cloverhill is that the fire alarm is being upgraded. There is a fire alarm system in the prison, but it proved to be oversensitive in some areas of the prison and it has caused activation. A more reliable and secure system is being installed and as the installation work progresses the offender population will increase until the 400 places are available to the courts, which I anticipate will be during May. There are approximately 100 prisoners in Cloverhill Prison at present. When it is fully operational, it will be the main remand prison. There will be a court adjacent to it to ensure that people will not need to travel up and down the country to various courts to which they would have been remanded. I anticipate this should save the Exchequer a considerable amount of money.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bail Act, 1997, the referendum of 1996 was passed overwhelmingly by the people who wanted us to insert a provision into the Constitution that a person could be refused bail if he or she was considered likely to commit a further serious offence if granted bail.

      <Quest>his views on whether the large increase in fees charged by the Registry of Deeds for the registration of a deed and the proposed increase in the fee charged by the Land Registry for a number of services is justified, particularly having regard to the strong criticism of the service being provided by both bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 17 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will set out the background to the decision to review the fees for the services provided by the registries. I have approved two new fees orders; one for the Land Registry and the other for the Registry of Deeds. The Registry of Deeds Fees Order took effect from 1 February last and the Land Registry Fees Order will take effect from 1 May next. The orders give effect to a comprehen<Col N="1347" /> sive review of the structure of the fees charged for the various services provided by the registries.</P>
    <P>As is required by the legislation, the Land Registry fees order has also been approved by the Minister for Finance. Both orders have been designed in order to provide a fair and balanced response to the changes which have taken place in the conveyancing and property markets since the previous orders were introduced as far back as 1991.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Government has approved the conversion of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds to a commercial semi-State body. Apart from the need to respond to changes since 1991, this review of the fees charged by the registries is an essential element in the preparations for this conversion. The new organisation will be expected to operate in a commercial environment and it will be critical to ensure that the fees are set at the correct levels having regard to the costs of providing the services and the need to ensure that the new organisation is placed, at the outset, on a sound commercial and financial footing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the size of the increases it should be remembered that, as already pointed out, the existing fees have not been reviewed since 1991. While the overall rate of increase varies, the cost of the most common dealing, the registration of a transfer of property valued at between £40,001 and £200,000, has been increased from £250 to £300 &ndash; a 20% rise which is not unreasonable given the period since the previous review.</P>
    <P>In line with traditional practice, there has not been any formal consultation with the Law Society. I understand, however, that the society will have been aware from routine discussions with the senior management of the registries that the fees were under review, and was free to make whatever representations it deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's proposal to defer the implementation of the new orders pending the allocation of additional staff, following discussions with the Department of Finance, additional staffing resources have been approved for the Land Registry. This has been done primarily in order to address the greatly increased number of dealings which have been lodged with the registries due, in the main, to the buoyant market in recent years. It is acknowledged that arising from this, the situation regarding arrears, in particular in the Land Registry, has deteriorated with consequent additional delays for certain types of dealings. This situation is being addressed and I see no basis for deferring the implementation of the fees orders in this context.</P>
    <P>I trust that the House will acknowledge that these new fees orders are both necessary and fair. They are being implemented following careful consideration, and on the recommendation of the Interim Board of the Land Registries, whose function it is to advise me regarding the smooth transition of the registries to commercial semi-State status.</P>

        <b>:</b> In reply to a parliamentary question I submitted before Christmas I was told it was 66,000. It is now 86,000. Counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford must wait for 65 weeks, while Counties Laois and Tipperary must wait 62 weeks and Counties Mayo and Sligo 60 weeks. That is an appalling record. Given that 16 counties will not have access to a telephone answering service except for one hour every day between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., does the Minister not have a brass neck to expect people to accept a substantial increase in Land Registry fees before a much better delivery service is made available to clients? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a review of the fees since 1991, which is a long time ago, and there has been a considerable increase in the price of property since then. There will be a reduction in fees in some instances. For example, the flat fee of £100 has been introduced for the registration charges, as opposed to the previous situation where the fees were based on the amount of the mortgage. Fees for transfers have also been reduced. A transfer of £40,000 in value will now cost £200 and this constitutes a reduction of £50.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of closing down the telephone line for a period, we have received correspondence from members of the legal profession to the effect that they consider that things have improved considerably since the staff were in a position to become involved solely in the issue of registration over certain periods. The level of delays is unacceptable. I do not pretend that the situation is ideal and I also appreciate the frustrations of solicitors and their clients around the country. We are doing our best to try to resolve it. It is my sincere wish to have the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds on a proper commercial footing as a semi-State agency by the end of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the figures for arrears of land registration were 86,000 at the end of last year? Does he also accept that it takes up to a year and a half to renew property in some parts of the country? I will not divulge the full litany of the complaints we all have received. No commercial company providing such a dreadful service could dream of increasing its fees. If it was a regulated industry there would be <Col N="1349" /> an expectation that there would be a rebate of fees. Will the Minister, therefore, amend his order to ensure that the new fees will not take effect until such time as we have the service he has now promised to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a review of the fees since 1991. It is now appropriate to hold a review and to implement the new fees orders. The Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds will have to operate on a commercial footing from next year when they receive semi-State status. In the commercial world they will seek market prices to ensure that their business is competitive and that they are able to pay their staff and purchase the necessary equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is putting the cart before the horse. He admits the service is not satisfactory, yet he has increased the fees and has further penalised the punter. Will he concede the effect of these price increases on house price inflation? Does he accept that a site costing £40,000, which is not unusual, will attract a Land Registry fee of £300? If a new folio has to be opened, which will invariably be necessary, a further £50 will be charged while a mortgage will attract an additional fee of £100. This would add a total additional cost of £450 to the building of a house. Where is the Minster's commitment to young couples, if fees of this kind are to be added to a transaction from which the punter received a very bad service? It is penalty tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair, I have indicated there will be a flat rate of £100 for mortgages. That will be of assistance. Prior to that the fee was based on value. Deputy Flanagan exaggerates the effect of these fees orders. They pale into insignificance compared to the increases in house <Col N="1350" /> prices and the other factors involved in purchasing a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret it is a very restricted service. It has arisen because of the huge backlog. There have been curtailments of telephone inquires because we needed the staff to handle dealing. I understand there will be a review at the end of this month. We will then be in a clearer position to state categorically how the Land Registry will proceed on the question of telephone calls. It is the Government's intention to proceed with the legislation to put the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds on a commercial semi-State footing, which will ultimately be to the benefit of the consumer. I understand this has been under consideration for the best part of a decade or more, so it should be welcomed.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister indicate the profit made by the Land Registry last year? I understand it was equivalent to that of a highly commercial operation. In the context of the Minister's decentralisation programme, does he not see merit in decentralising the Land Registry so that Land Registry offices strategically positioned in the regions would be able to serve the surrounding catchment areas? I understand there is an office in Waterford. Does he not agree that it would also make sense to locate one in the midlands, the west and the south-west, but I hope not Cahirciveen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan has benefited considerably from decentralisation. We have built a major prison in his constituency, with 515 places, which is more than Deputy Flanagan's party did when in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, rather than going further along that line, an increased level of decentralisation is of course desirable and the Government, through the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1351" /> has made it clear that the intention is to decentralise 10,000 public servants throughout the State. The difficulty with further decentralising the Land Registry is that the expertise required by an examiner of titles is very specialised, and people involved in examining titles are very informed in terms of their role. That presents a difficulty if the people concerned do not wish to move. It is not similar to other jobs in the public service where positions can be interchangeable. Experts in the Land Registry are different from ordinary civil servants &ndash; I am not in any way denigrating ordinary civil servants, but people have different levels of expertise. It is difficult to train people in the Land Registry and it takes a considerable period of time. I do not think that further decentralisation of the Land Registry would mean a greater level of dealings in a shorter period of time.</P>

    <P>Deputy Howlin has pointed out that this is the same answer, and he is correct.

My view is that it is far more desirable that we have a transparent and open system in so far as we possibly can. On the other hand, in relation to reports such as this, it may not be possible to publish the report as doing so might impinge on a subsequent court case. I will not know until I see the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a further brief supplementary question as I regard this as probably the most serious matter we will discuss on Question Time with the Minister for a very long time. Given that the allegations are against members of the Garda, the investigation is being carried out by the Garda and the report is to be made to the Garda, surely the Minister has an absolute <Col N="1353" /> obligation to ensure nobody will exclusively judge their own cause and that there will be a full reporting in public on all these matters so that not a scintilla of a question can remain when a conclusion is reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am determined that there will be no scintilla of doubt about justice being done in this matter. Clearly, prosecution is a matter for the DPP who is independent in the exercise of his functions. I have little doubt but that the DPP will be prepared to take prosecutions if necessary on foot of any report made available to him. The fact that the Garda is investigating this matter should not indicate that there will be anything but the highest integrity in terms of the investigation. Assistant Commissioner Carty, who is investigating the matter, is a man of the very highest quality, as will be testified to by anybody who knows him. I am quite satisfied and confident that the report he will make available will be independent, that there will be no smokescreens and that all the truth will be seen.</P>

However, I do not accept that there has been an <Col N="1354" /> increase in organised crime in recent times &ndash; for example, in relation to one area sometimes associated with organised criminals, the number of armed robberies decreased by more than 20% between 1995 and 1999.</P>
      <P>In the past few years there has been a major crackdown on organised crime. Legislation specifically designed to target organised crime has been introduced, namely, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced while in Opposition; the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996; the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and other Purposes Act, 1996; the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996; and the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which I introduced in the House.</P>

      <P>The successes of these units are well documented and it would be useful to refer briefly to them. Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 1999, the bureau has obtained section 2 interim orders on property to a total value of over £7.6 million and section 3 interlocutory orders on property to a total value of £5.4 million, under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded almost £33 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity and social welfare determinations, and savings amounted to over £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>In 1998 and 1999 seizures of illicit drugs amounted to an estimated street value of over £120 million and the money laundering investigation unit of the Garda Síochána received over 2,500 suspicious transaction reports with a value of over £200 million. These measures have been recognised as a major step forward in the fight against organised crime and have resulted in the dismantling of major organised crime gangs and a high percentage of persons have been prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to prison.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of violence and reprisals, the Deputy is well aware that the use of violence and intimidation by criminals is not a new phenomenon and in cases where the victims are also involved in crime, there can be major difficulties investigating the crime. I already referred to the legislation introduced in recent years to combat organised crime and the establishment of specialised Garda units. In addition, I introduced a witness security programme which has been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our legislation is among the most effective in Europe in combating organised crime and this is well recognised by our EU partners. However, I do not say there is complacency on my behalf. In this context I constantly evaluate our response to organised crime and I assure the Deputy that the <Col N="1355" /> necessary steps will be taken to deal with this situation.</P>

      </i>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in regard to recent violent incidents and he has informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards these areas of criminal activity and that a continued proactive and integrated approach is taken by the Garda in the investigation of cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of organised criminals. He has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and bring to justice those involved.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that in recent times there has been an increase in the number of gangland murders and that this closely mirrors the period prior to the murder of Veronica Guerin when there was a similarly regular list of such murders? Does he further accept that in most, if not all, of these cases charges have not been brought, the Garda does not appear to be on top of them and those who are involved will begin to believe they are immune, which will inevitably lead to further murders of those who threaten them? Does he agree that even a casual observer of the crime scene in Dublin will be aware of gangland murders occurring on an increasingly regular basis and this is a serious matter? Will he indicate what action he has taken in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner to deal with this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been ten murders this year but it is not correct to state that the Garda has not been successful in dealing with them. My understanding is that there have been six detections, which is a good record and it is early days. With regard to the issue of gangland killings and organised crime, the Deputy will appreciate that it is extremely difficult to identify whether a specific killing arises from organised criminal activity, but there is no doubt there has been some evidence, as he pointed out, that people who are involved in crime, or at least known to the Garda, have been victims.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Garda Commissioner recently in regard to this matter and he has informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards these areas of criminal activity and that a continued proactive approach is taken by the Garda in the investigation of cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of organised criminals. He has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and to bring those involved to justice. I assure the Deputy of my unwavering commitment to dealing with the twin problems of drugs and organised crime and I constantly evaluate our response to them.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Garda Commissioner recently acknowledged on RTE radio that there were 11 gangland killings last year, most of which <Col N="1356" /> occurred in Dublin, and there have been three so far this year &ndash; the two teenagers who were found in the canal and a man in Finglas two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>With regard to a proactive strategy, is the Minister talking about making swoops on people? The Garda knows who these people are, where they live and that they have guns. There should be pre-emptive strikes against those involved in organised crime, similar to those carried out against drug dealers, etc., rather than us patting ourselves on the back because a number of people have been arrested or charged. These people should be hit hard and early at source.</P>

I briefly outlined the Garda's success in the fight against organised crime, its record on drug seizures and so on and the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau in earlier questions. Special units in the Garda, such as the CAB, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the national bureau of criminal investigation, have had a major impact on the operations of these gangs. In addition, other investigative teams used by the Garda are achieving considerable results. The success of the team based at Lucan Garda station which has tracked the killers of Veronica Guerin is a prime example of the impact of our law enforcement measures on the operation of criminal gangs.</P>

    <P>Interviews of candidates for the 1999 competition will commence in the next month or two. As the House will be aware I have overseen one of the most significant, sustained recruitment campaigns by the Garda in recent times to ensure the Government's target of a total Garda strength of 12,000 by 2002 will be reached. We are on target to meet this objective. The strength of the force <Col N="1357" /> at the beginning of this year has already exceeded 11,400, which is the highest level in more than a decade.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is the Minister concerned that there has been a dramatic decline in the number of people applying for Garda training? The number of applicants in 1992 was 15,000 but it fell to 6,000 in 1998 and 5,000 in 1999. Does he accept that policing is becoming less attractive for a number of reasons, particularly a lack of promotional opportunities? Has any consideration been given to extending the Garda retirement age given that the number applying for training has dwindled to one third of the figure seven years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Recruitment competitions were held approximately every three years but now they are held annually and this has meant there has been no opportunity for a reservoir of candidates to build up. The buoyant labour market has affected the number of candidates. Nevertheless, we have not run into any major difficulty in obtaining sufficient applicants to meet our requirements and there has been no fall in the standard of applicants. The Government approved the recruitment of 550 trainees in 1999 and 500 in 2000 to achieve its target of a force of 12,000 by 2002. The 1999 target has been met and no particular difficulties are envisaged for this year. The need for further competition to reach this target is kept under review.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of retirement age, wastage and recruitment requirements of the force are monitored, but there are no proposals to extend the retirement age. We have had no difficulties in finding suitable applicants to maintain and significantly increase the size of the force to date. The Deputy is correct in stating there has been a fall in the number of applicants because the labour market is buoyant and different opportunities are available to young people. It is heartening that the children of senior members of the force recently graduated, which indicates that there is still a vocation among some families for the Garda life. That is wonderful.</P>

      <P>In April 1999, the Garda authorities hosted an international conference, co-funded by the EU Commission and the Government, entitled &ldquo;Providing a Police Service in a Developing Multi-ethnic and Multi-cultural Ireland&rdquo;. The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in <Col N="1358" /> policing a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society. The training currently provided to student and probationer gardaí is being reviewed in the light of the outcomes of this conference.</P>
      <P>The working group established to review all aspects of Garda training in this area and to develop best practices in the light of ongoing changes in the policing environment has an ambitious work programme and its activities are ongoing. The group has produced an action plan comprising key elements, including the establishment of a programme focusing on the further development of human rights training in the Garda Síochána and the publication of a revised code of ethics for the Garda Síochána. The group plans to have most of the strands of the action plan in place by December 2000.</P>
      <P>A follow-up conference is planned for late October-early November of this year with the aim of exploring and developing human rights in a policing context.</P>
      <P>The Garda Human Rights Initiative 1999-2000, Policing and Human Rights: Promoting Best Practice, has, as one of its core tasks, the further development of human rights training at all levels within the organisation, including human rights training in the context of policing in a multiethnic society.</P>

      <P>The working group is in its infancy, relatively speaking, but I take on board Deputy Howlin's view that it would be desirable to provide training for older members of the Garda Síochána to ensure that they are in a position to police a multi-ethnic society. The education being provided to the recruits in the college is excellent and obviously we are in a position to deal with the whole issue of policing a multi-ethnic society within the confines of Templemore. Deputy Howlin's suggestion is desirable, however, and I hope that the working group comes up with further observations which might be favourable.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Minster for the Environment and Local Government introduced this measure as a road safety device because the Minister has responsibility for road safety. With regard to whether the alcometer could be struck down by the courts, that is a matter of conjecture. The advice available to us suggests this will not happen. We cannot try to run a criminal justice system on the basis that a measure which is introduced might be struck down by the courts for some reason or other. All we can do is take the best advice available. With regard to whether urine and blood samples should be taken after the alcometer has been used, my reply to that would be in the negative. There is provision under the Road Traffic Acts for the Garda Síochána to bring a case under the old section as it is known, that is to say, against an individual on the basis that he or she was driving while incapable. Oral evidence can be adduced from the Garda Síochána as regards the capacity of the individual to drive in that event.</P>

That is a mechanism which can be used by the Garda Síochána in the event that the alcometer is struck down by the courts, but I am convinced that will not happen. The alcometer has been tested, it has been established to be effective in other jurisdictions and there is no reason it should be struck down. That is my personal view and that is the advice which is available to me, and I have to accept it.</P>

      <P>It is long-standing practice not to comment in detail on the case of any individual prisoner. I can confirm, however, that the prisoner concerned has applied for a transfer to <Col N="1361" /> the United Kingdom to serve his sentence under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995. This Act enables the transfer of prisoners to and from this jurisdiction to allow them serve their sentences in their own country as provided for by the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires that extensive documentation be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. Three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the prisoner concerned.</P>
      <P>To be considered for transfer, the following conditions must be satisfied in every case: the person must be a national of the country to which he or she wants to be transferred or have sufficiently close ties to that country to warrant a transfer; the sentence imposed must be final and there must be no further charges outstanding; there must normally be at least six months of the sentence left to serve; and the offence must also be a crime in the home country.</P>
      <P>The UK authorities set a tariff for all prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment in England and Wales, that is, a minimum period of time to be served by the prisoner before the case is submitted to their parole board. A transferred life sentence prisoner would be treated in the same way. Prior to giving final consent to a transfer application, I would be advised by the Home Secretary of a provisional tariff to be set on a life sentence prisoner. In the event of a transfer, the prisoner's tariff would be then confirmed by the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>In this case my Department is in the process of collating the necessary documentation and reports required under the convention. When this has been completed and if the criteria outlined are satisfied, the prisoner's application will be forwarded to the United Kingdom authorities for their consideration.</P>
      <P>It is not standard practice to seek to attach conditions to any transfer. The principle underpinning the convention is that once a transfer takes place, the home jurisdiction manages the sentence in accordance with its laws. However, where a prisoner serving a life sentence is to be transferred to the United Kingdom, I would have to be satisfied that the proposed tariff is appropriate.</P>

      <P>If a person is transferred under this legislation, the issue of the individual's release, but on reaching his tariff only, would obviously be a matter for the United Kingdom authorities. My understanding is that for all prisoners sentenced to life in England and Wales, the UK authorities also set a tariff, that is, a minimum time which is to be served by the individual concerned. Prior to giving the final consent to any transfer application, I would be advised of the provisional tariff to be imposed on a life sentenced prisoner being transferred. Obviously, the prisoner would also be advised prior to giving his or her consent to the return to the United Kingdom. The provisional tariff would be based on the circumstances of the crime, as set out in the information provided by the Department. The UK Ministers would set the tariff taking into account the views of the Lord Chief Justice of England. Once the prisoner was returned to England, the tariff would be confirmed by the Ministers.</P>
      <P>As with all life sentenced prisoners in England and Wales, a transferred prisoner would have an opportunity to make representations about the length of the tariff he or she would have to serve before being considered for release. My understanding is that the average length of time served by released life sentenced prisoners in the United Kingdom is fairly similar to our 13 to 14 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 19 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond on this matter because a considerable degree of misunderstanding prevails in relation to the management of sex offenders in custody. The reality is that many sex offenders in custody are either unsuited or are unwilling to participate in intensive group programmes, like the course at Arbour Hill referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, due to insufficient motivation, emotional immaturity or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this Arbour Hill pro<Col N="1363" /> gramme. All applicants are interviewed by the programme delivery team to determine suitability. Where the number of suitable applicants exceeds the number of places available on the programme, priority is given to offenders whose release dates are closest.</P>
    <P>Of the 103 sex offenders released on completion of their sentences during 1998, 11 had completed the specialised sex offender group treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison. Some 80 sex offenders were released during 1999. Of these, five had completed the Arbour Hill group programme prior to their release. In addition, many of those released would also have undergone individual counselling either from my Department's psychology service or the Probation and Welfare Service. These would also have had access to the thinking skills programme which targets offending behaviour and relapse prevention and about which I will have a further word later in this reply.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that the prisoners who were released in the period in question included, as well as those who participated in the intensive group programme referred to, prisoners who decided not to participate in this programme, prisoners who after professional assessment were deemed not to be suitable to participate in it or where it was determined that it was beyond their ability to participate in it.</P>
    <P>I asked the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. I have since been assured by him that this matter is being given personal attention. Given that there are more sex offenders in custody in the Curragh &ndash; 90 plus &ndash; than in any other prison except Arbour Hill, efforts are being concentrated there at present.</P>
    <P>Public discussion and commentary about this issue frequently implies there is only one form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect. There are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their personal tendencies towards offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling from my Department's psychology service and from the Probation and Welfare Service. This is a largely demand-led service to individual prisoners who ask for help. The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since 1998.</P>
    <P>The third programme, which tends to receive most media coverage, is an extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison and which is <Col N="1364" /> delivered by officers of the Probation and Welfare and psychology service of my Department. The fourth intervention, which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement, involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis and a call-out basis as well as in response to individual crises.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>There were 354 convicted sex offenders in custody in prisons on Wednesday, 23 February 2000. It is not possible to quantify the number of rehabilitation places available to these prisoners. All prisoners are involved in a rehabilitation programme of one type or another.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Irish Prisons Service director general and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh. Prisoners and staff at the Curragh have all been notified of the inception of the new prisoner programmes there, one exclusively involving specialist staff as in the intensive Arbour Hill programme and the other programme on the same pattern as the thinking skills programmes in Cork and Arbour Hill which are delivered by multi-disciplinary teams, including specially selected and trained prison officers.</P>
    <P>The first step being taken involves the expansion of generic therapeutic services in the Curragh. The Probation and Welfare Service and the psychology service of the Department are recruiting extra staff and it is intended that the Curragh will have priority in the allocation of resources. A member of the psychology service and a probation officer have already been assigned to duties there. They will be joined in their work with offenders at the Curragh by further members of their services as the roll out of support services for sex offenders at the prison continues.</P>
    <P>The sequence which will be followed at the Curragh will be as follows: analysis of response by individual prisoners and staff to circular from governor as to their willingness to participate in the new programme; selection and training of local staff in all disciplines and services in thinking skills programme and selection of first prisoner participants; delivery of first modules of thinking skills programme in late summer 2000 and roll-out of intensive sex offenders' treatment programme later in the year 2000 drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork Prison early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders, including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, Probation and Welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my <Col N="1365" /> Department's psychology service. The skills taught in this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act &ndash; how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. This programme is considered by the director general and his advisers to be the preferred first line of approach to rehabilitating sex offenders in custody as in many cases it builds up their frequently low personal motivation to address in depth offending behaviour.</P>
    <P>When the intensive sex offenders treatment programme is introduced in the Curragh during the current year, it will be operated by the Probation and Welfare Service and psychology service in the same mode as the current Arbour Hill programme.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the director general that he has deputed a senior member of his transition team at prison governor level and another colleague to investigate the possibility of extending the range of multi-disciplinary group work programmes with sex offenders here based on successful interventions which have been developed in prisons in Scotland and England in recent years. This study is not expected to be completed until early next year</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective for the Irish Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than is currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions, including Ireland, that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or legal option in such cases.</P>
    <P>A major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of this Department and the department of psychology, University College, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for tabling the questions.</P>
      <P>I will begin, as I did this morning, by expressing my sincere regret at the decision of Brian Joyce to resign as chairman of CIE. He has been an effective chairman with a clear understanding of the issues facing CIE. In my personal dealings with him, I have always found him to be courteous, professional and very business like. I am genuinely sorry he has chosen to resign so close to the end of his term of office and I wish him well for the future.</P>
      <P>I first heard of Mr. Joyce's decision to resign on the 7 o'clock news on RTE radio this morning. I saw his resignation letter for the first time when I arrived at my office this morning. The Secretary General of my Department was in contact with Mr. Joyce yesterday to arrange a meeting between him, the Secretary General and me at 8 o'clock this morning to discuss the railway safety audit carried out by the IRMS. I had also invited Mr. Gerry Duggan, chairman of the CIE safety committee and a board member, to attend that meeting but, unfortunately, he is out of the country on business. Given that we were due to meet this morning, Members will understand my surprise on hearing he had resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was on the Cabinet agenda since <Col N="1367" /> last week. Every Cabinet Minister had a copy of the safety report despite what was said previously but we will go into that later. I have given every Member of the House a copy of that report as well.</P>
    <P>I will now address a number of matters raised in Mr. Joyce's letter of resignation. I am sorry he has decided to resign at a time when CIE can look forward to the revitalisation of public transport. For many years and, under successive Governments, CIE has had to live with the consequences of under-investment in public transport. This Government was the first to recognise the importance of public transport to the economy.</P>
    <P>In the past few months, I have succeeded in obtaining Government agreement to a £2.2 billion capital programme for public transport, the details of which are set out in the national development plan. Much of that investment strategy derives from the results of investment reviews carried out by CIE.</P>
    <P>A theme running through Mr. Joyce's resignation letter and his earlier speech a year and a half ago to the Chartered Institute of Transport is the need for the company to have the freedom to get on and do its job free from ministerial interference. I have no argument with Mr. Joyce on that, but I draw a distinction between interference and democratic stewardship. CIE is a State owned company. This year it will receive £350 million from the Exchequer. I am accountable to the Oireachtas in relation to CIE and the expenditure of State funds. I do not interfere in the day to day running of the company. However, I have a responsibility to ensure the company pursues policies that are aligned with the interests of shareholders who, in this case, are Irish taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Opposition cannot have it every way. Two weeks ago it criticised me for not intervening in the Dublin Bus dispute and now it is saying I intervened, which I did not &ndash; I want to make it clear that I did not intervene in the recent Dublin Bus dispute. While I naturally kept in contact with the parties to brief myself on developments, I took great care to allow the State's industrial relations machinery to get on with the job. This was confirmed by Peter Bunting, general secretary of the NBRU on RTE's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning. Fair dues to him for his Northern honesty and telling the truth straight as it was in that case. It was ICTU which intervened in the dispute and this led to agreement on a new framework for negotiations under the auspices of the LRC and a subsequent suspension of the threatened strike action.</P>
    <P>The chairman's letter mentioned fares and public service contracts. I was the first Minister since 1991 to seek Government approval of an across the board fares increase for all the CIE companies. Again I was harangued in the Dáil for even looking for it. The company sought an increase of about 10%. I recommended a 5% <Col N="1368" /> increase to Cabinet, having taken account of the interests of the company and public transport users. I was criticised by the Opposition for approving any increase. The former CIE chairman, at a very friendly meeting two or three months ago, put forward the proposal that I should give permission to the board to index CPI increases yearly to the fares structure at CIE. I told him I was prepared to consider some form of indexed fares increases linked to public service contracts.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on a public service contract for Dublin Bus were concluded in the autumn and, in line with the commitments I had given to CIE management and the unions, I put proposals to Government in November for the implementation of the contract. The Attorney General advised that I did not have the legal powers under the Transport Acts to enter into such a binding multi-annual contract with CIE. That issue is now being considered as part of my Department's review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, which the Government decided last November should be completed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The former chairman also referred to concerns about Luas, particularly that the cost of the project might divert resources from other public transport projects. Those concerns were addressed in the national development plan, which sets out clear financial envelopes for a range of public transport projects. Resources have been separately allocated to mainline rail, suburban rail, urban public transport and regional bus services as well as Luas.</P>
    <P>The former chairman also said that he had only heard about the PPP operation of Luas from the public press. The facts are that the Government decided in 1998 that Luas should be one of a number of pilot public private partnerships. I subsequently commissioned consultants, Andersen Consultants, to advise me on an appropriate PPP approach to Luas. That report was sent formally to CIE for its comments. It gave a detailed written response, which my Department subsequently discussed with it. I will put specific proposals for a Luas public private partnership to Government shortly, having considered the views of CIE and others who replied when we asked for their views. I will then communicate the Government decision to CIE.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the chairman of CIE is a statutory function of the Government under section 6 of the Transport Act, 1950. I will engage in consultations with my Cabinet colleagues with a view to the early appointment of a new chairperson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a specific question. This morning in her radio interview she clearly inferred the reason for Mr. Joyce's resignation was that he would not face the music in relation to rail safety deficiencies. In view of the fact that she denied Mr. Joyce a copy of the rail safety report, that CIE only got that report at 11 o'clock this morning and that this is utterly <Col N="1369" /> untrue, will she now apologise to Mr. Joyce for making that inference as to the reason for his resignation when that is an entirely diversionary tactic in terms of the real reason he resigned?</P>

The arrangement was that he would meet me at 8 o'clock this morning. The agenda was to be rail safety. The matter was to go direct to Cabinet and from Cabinet to publication, all of which has happened. I do not understand why he did not come in to me and say, &ldquo;I want to resign.&rdquo;  To be truthful, I do not blame him for wanting to resign, but that is another matter.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that mindless, stupid remarks to seek to cause a diversion <Col N="1371" /> away from the issue before this House are not appropriate to this serious situation? Given the meddling and incompetence of the Minister in her handling of this and other semi-State authorities, will she tell the House how it came to pass that a letter was delivered by hand to her Department sometime yesterday afternoon and that she did not get it until whatever time she arrived in her Department this morning? Will she accept that when a third chairperson of a commercial semi-State company feels compelled to resign, arising from her meddling, serious questions have to be asked about the management of her portfolio that will not be clouded or brushed over by giggles or making light of the matter? We are fed up with the Minister making light of these issues, getting a laugh and diverting from the real issues.</P>

Will the Minister agree that the real reason for this crisis is neglect and under-investment, and that the failure of the Government to tackle the real issue of competition within CIE is at the root of this problem? The Minister has made many speeches and press statements about competition, privatisation, the public service and public private partnership, but effectively there have been no decisions.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Mitchell's point of view that CIE is a troubled company. It has a troubled past to which it insists on reverting. For the past two weeks we have had replays and revisions of the 1995 carry-on within CIE. I believe there are several more episodes planned.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there is a malaise in CIE and that it has a troubled past. I would ask the company to embrace with vigour and enthusiasm the capital programme before it. The capital programme was expressed to me in very good terms when the four executives of Iarnród Éireann came to see me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the clear need for competition and I agree with her. We have undertaken a review of the 1932 Act. That review will form part of the infrastructural committee and within that the public service contracts will be addressed. Let us cast our minds back briefly to 1995. Mr. Dermot O'Leary resigned in April 1995. Mr. Eamon Walsh was appointed in April 1995. In May 1995, Mr. Michael McDonnell was appointed. I looked up the press release by the then Government and they were described in 1995 as &ldquo;the dream team&rdquo;. In November 1995, Mr. Brian Joyce was appointed as chairman and almost five years later he resigned. Let us cast our minds back to April 1995 when there were several resignations. It is interesting to look back on those periods.</P>

        <b>:</b> Has the problem arisen from the fact that the Minister was content to let matters trundle along in CIE while workers there, and in particular in Dublin Bus which was referred to in the chairman's resignation letter, were forced to bend to the yoke of disgracefully low pay, disgraceful conditions and unsocial hours? The problem arose when Dublin Bus workers cried halt and said, &ldquo;We will take no more of having to subsidise public transport&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(Dublin West)<b>:</b> Is it true that the Minister then panicked and put pressure on CIE management to do something in a hurry? Will the Minister agree that CIE management stands as indicted as herself because it tolerated gross abuse of the workforce in the form of exploitation of wages and conditions? When the Minister refers to democratic stewardship, does she agree that in supposedly stewarding CIE democratically, she has failed dismally in allowing this <Col N="1373" /> situation to continue? Since she failed to put in place proper conditions for the workers, she is now reaping the rewards of that failure.</P>

If she is not prepared to do that, the House must see it for what it is. May I ask the Minister about another point arising from her interview this morning? She said she had a policy of non-interference in CIE's day to day issues. How, therefore, can she explain the unprecedented appointment of Mr. John Behan as human resource manager, who is not to report to the chairman, board or chief executive of CIE, but to her personally?</P>

      <P>Second, how can she say that she does not interfere when she intervened in July 1997 in relation to the Imp buses issue which paralysed Bus Éireann and is still unresolved two and a half years later? Is it the Minister's agenda not just to get rid of the chairman of CIE but also to get rid of the chief executive and to appoint a new executive chairman, and that she has a candidate in mind for that post?</P>

        <b>: </b>Was the dreadful pay and conditions of Dublin Bus workers discussed over lobster and white wine when she met the chairman? Will she agree that it was extremely dishonest of her to use the subvention given to Dublin Bus in 1995 as a baseline to say in later years that it was the same or increased? Will she acknowledge that in 1987 the subvention to Dublin Bus was £16.4 million and that this has decreased drastically since then? Will she agree that all the published material indicates this is the lowest subvention in Europe or the United States? Will she use the current position to implement a completely different foreman style of management within CIE, including Dublin Bus, one that will democratically involve the workers in having a proper input so that they can bring about decent conditions and pay? Will she increase the subsidy to enable this to take place?</P>

I do not eat lobster or drink white wine to which the Deputy referred; I drink red wine. The Deputy is correct in relation to the 1987 subsidy. In 1996 there were vigorous efforts to cut back on the subsidy which was £3.4 million; four years later it is £13.2 million.  </P>

      <P>The Minister said she does not know the reason Mr. Joyce resigned.

He concludes, &ldquo;However, you and I have fundamentally differing views on this and are unlikely to agree in the foreseeable future&rdquo;. I put it to the Minister that the decision of Mr. Joyce represents a serious vote of no confidence in her as Minister for Public Enterprise and represents the sixth senior departure of a senior executive, chairman or director under her watch and that ultimately these people have said in no uncertain terms they have no confidence in her as Minister with responsibility for transport.</P>

I refer to 1995 when the now leader of the Oppo<Col N="1379" /> sition's best, best friend was Minister and there was a quick succession of huge upheavals in CIE. There were five or six separate resignations at the time. These are now being rehashed in the Sunday newspapers. Court cases are pending against the then Minister, and now myself, the Government and CIE and search and discovery documents are to be found. These relate to the adventures and intrigue of Deputy Bruton's best, best friend.</P>

I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs is currently in Belfast and is involved in negotiations and discussions with the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mr. Mandelson, and with parties there. In view of the concerns of many people both inside and outside this House about the drift which is now occurring in respect of the situation in Northern Ireland, will the Minister say if time will be made available tomorrow for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on this issue to ensure the political vacuum does not become any deeper or wider? </P>

In replying to a question on the White Paper on Defence during last Wednesday's Order of Business, the Taoiseach stated that the Government decided to approve the strength of the Permanent Defence Forces of 10,500 together with the option of 2,250 recruits &ndash; that should read 250 recruits. Most people are aware of that, but this corrects the record.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is currently very involved in discussions and it is best to leave him to get on with them.

      <P>The Minister is always very informative and helpful on the Order of Business. I therefore want to ask him a question on the prisons Bill with which he may be able to help me. In February 1998 the Taoiseach indicated that it would be ready in early 1999. In September of 1999, the Taoiseach said it would be ready around Christmas of 1999. We were told in November that the general scheme of the Bill would be ready early this year. In the general press release we received on the legislative programme we are told it will not be ready until late in 2000. Will the Minister give us the history of how this Bill has slipped and slipped and state why it is not a matter of priority to the Government to reorganise the Prisons Service given that we have more prison officers than prisoners?</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 31, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;imports or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is significantly weakened by the exclusion of imports, which is unfair to Irish producers. What will be the situation if a dealer imports cattle and they are of inferior quality to cattle produced in Ireland because of the strict controls which will apply here arising from the Bill? Surely this would be considered anti-competitive from an Irish point of view and would place the Irish producer at a disadvantage. I am in favour of ensuring high standards, but the same high standards should apply regardless of whether the animals are produced in Ireland or imported. It is, therefore, important that the Bill take account of imported animals. At it stands <Col N="1390" /> they are excluded and it is important to include them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has proposed amendments to section 2 and to the First Schedule which would have the effect of extending the scope of the Bill to imported meat. The purpose of the Bill is to provide additional guarantees regarding the safety of Irish cattle and beef to promote consumer confidence in the Irish product and to promote its marketability. Thus it would be contrary to the purpose of the scheme to include imported beef. It could also constitute a barrier to trade in contravention of EU and international legislation. Animals imported into the State would have to be covered since they could subsequently be traded, slaughtered and processed in the same way as domestic production.</P>
      <P>The proposal to include imported meat under the scope of the Bill arises from the mistaken concern that meat imported into the EU from third countries does not have to comply with the same strict requirements as that produced in the EU and that the consumer would be at risk from such product. I again assure Deputies that this is not the case. Meat imported from outside the EU is also subject to strict regulation. Meat may only be imported from third countries and from establishments in those countries which have been specifically approved by EU veterinary officials. In addition, the meat may only be imported through approved import points and it must be accompanied by animal and public health certification conforming with EU requirements. The list of countries and establishments approved for export to the EU is subject to continuous monitoring and review.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage, Deputy Connaughton expressed concern regarding the position on imported feedingstuffs. Imported feedingstuffs are included under the scope of the Bill because such materials are generally included in the feedingstuffs manufactured in Ireland. Similar to the situation in relation to meat imported from third countries, the EU regulates the import of feedingstuff or feedingstuff materials from third countries.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that there are issues of concern to Deputies regarding imports of beef. While I do not think this Bill is the way to address these issues, I will give thought to ways of making the imports position more transparent. I give that commitment here because I have an interest in that area. This issue is not related to the Bill.</P>

      <P>No, because there is a deadline of 6 p.m. Since Committee Stage, many farmers have contacted me about the problem here. We discussed this problem in great detail the last day with the Minister, Deputy Walsh. The problem is that draconian measures are placed on Irish farmers. I went though every single one of those rules since 1921. If we have to move forward we should at least be fair to the farming community. I am not sure the food imports into this country will be treated in the same way as the foodstuffs produced here. For example, feedstuffs imported from outside our jurisdiction will not have the same conditions applied to them as those which apply to farmers here. When New Zealand lamb and meat from the continent and around the world arrives here we have no way of knowing how tight the regime is in that country as far as traceability is concerned. From the time the first ear tag is placed on an Irish calf until the day it is slaughtered it facilitates traceability. No matter what country one goes to, there is not any regime in Europe or in the world that is as tight as that which applies here. Is not this system anti-competitive? Given the huge amounts of imports, we have much less control over them. The Minister was extremely weak on this point the last day, hence the reason we put it to a vote. Time constraints do not permit me to go through the whole issue. However, it must be clear to the Minister that farmers are extraordinarily upset about what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a farmer in counties Mayo, Galway or Cork sells a heifer to a local butcher traceability works in that case. We know who the farmer is, the ear tag must be correct and so on. Suppose the butcher or the supermarket sells the meat to a person in the local town and a member of that person's family gets sick. It could be construed under this legislation that liability for what happened would fall on the primary producer, even though it may have been the fridge in the supermarket or in the butcher's shop that was at fault. I said that on several occasions on Committee Stage and we had a vote on it. I do not like what I hear the Minister say because it appears he has either missed the point or wants the liability to <Col N="1392" /> attach itself to the primary producer. Neither my party nor the farmers will accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are leaving a big gap in the legislation by not ensuring the seamless process from farm through to final product. It might well have been highlighted last week with the salmonella outbreak where the main concern expressed related to the farm and the possibility of trying to isolate the salmonella from the pigs at production level. To some extent the product was ignored. There should be a chain between the primary product and the finished product at consumer level. From a consumer safety point of view there is a huge gap in that chain.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Connaughton I raised this matter on Committee Stage. I am concerned about the traceability of imports into this country. We do not know from where much of the meat is coming. If a butcher is selling this and a local farmer's beast at the same time, who is to say which meat it is. This is a matter about which many farmers, butchers and wholesalers are concerned. If anything can be done to alleviate these fears I ask the Minister to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed by my colleagues on this issue. There are no controls on EU beef, lamb or any other imports, including imports of third country products. A cut of beef could be sold to a customer over the counter by a butcher. If there is something wrong with it and the customer makes a complaint the butcher could say it belongs to the local farmer when it may have come from Britain, continental Europe or a third country market. The farmer is the one who will be penalised. There is a huge issue here in relation to liability. The beef can be traced back to the farmer in question and he could end up with serious liabilities. E.coli 0157 is present in an animal when it leaves the farm. Someone may subsequently be contaminated by e.coli 0157. If it was discovered that the infection was resistant to antibiotics it could be argued that the farmer was guilty of dosing the animal with antibiotics.</P>
      <P>This legislation has serious implications for farmers who are faced with large amounts of red tape and they are very angry because of this. If our food industry is to be restricted and farmers are to be encumbered with bureaucratic requirements, the same requirements should be imposed on farmers in other EU countries. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are based on the continued misunderstanding concerning the scope of the scheme. The Bill must be read in conjunction with existing legislation on food which already covers food businesses. Such businesses, which include retail butchers, supermarkets, grocery stores and other food outlets, are already strictly regulated under the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regu<Col N="1393" /> lations, 1998 (S.I. No. 86 of 1998). These regulations set out detailed standards for premises and procedures in respect of food businesses, covering the entire scope of their operations. The regulations are enforced by the health boards which, like the Department, are agents of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in the delivery of food safety across the food chain for the benefit of consumers. The health boards operate a system of regular controls, inspections, sampling and analysis, the criteria for which are laid down in the European Communities (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 85 of 1998). These regulations provide powers to the health boards of seizure and detention of product, product withdrawal, suspension of operations or closure of businesses. There is also power to prosecute such businesses in the courts.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I am strongly of the belief that it would constitute a duplication and a waste of valuable resources to include these businesses in the registration, inspection and approval processes under the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill. The introduction of a two tier inspection and approval system for these businesses would also be contrary to the Government's regulatory reform initiative, which seeks to simplify regulations and procedures for businesses. However, by regulating primary production and processing, the Bill will regulate the sources of supply for such businesses. Under the scheme, this sector will be obliged to ensure that when buying or receiving Irish beef they deal only with participants who are approved.</P>

      <P>This provision is contained in section 6(1)<i>(d). </i>Non-compliance will constitute an offence for which rigorous penalties are provided in section 25. In addition, provision has been made in section 29 for the appointment of authorised officers to check whether this provision is being complied with. The combination of the legislation operated by the health boards and the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill will ensure that the consumer is protected across the entire food chain with regard to controls on the production, processing and sale of Irish cattle and beef.</P>
      <P>The recent salmonella scare in relation to cooked ham is a case in point. The local authorities and the Department, as agents of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, are actively involved in the investigation into the source of this outbreak in relation to their areas of responsibility. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, as the agency responsible for food safety, has taken the lead role and is co-ordinating the investigation into this outbreak across the entire food chain. The protection of the consumer is thus being assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The phrase proposed in the amendment to section 5 is largely aspirational and does not have any real meaning in law. Furthermore, its inclusion could give the wrong signal to consumers in so far as it would convey the mistaken impression that the Bill as drafted is not all-embracing and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I addressed the concerns raised by Deputy Connaughton regarding the import of beef and feedstuffs. I have undertaken to look at the question but I do not think the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill is the correct place to do this.</P>
    <P> Last year we exported 545,000 tonnes out of a total beef slaughter of 600,000 tonnes. We consumed only 55,000 tonnes of beef. Approximately 5,000 tonnes of beef are imported annually under strict licence. I have outlined the procedures involved in importing beef. E.coli 1057 has been mentioned. Were it not for the procedures I put in place, we would be at great risk from e.coli 1057. This disease has affected Scotland and the United States where it has caused loss of life. The strict procedures put in place by the Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has saved the very valuable Irish food industry.</P>
    <P>There will shortly be a new EU directive on the liabilities areas mentioned by Deputy Naughten. I was informed at a recent conference that Commissioner Byrne is working on this matter and I look forward to receiving that directive. When the directive is issued it will be necessary to legislate for its implementation in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 40, after &ldquo;Minister.&rdquo;  to insert &ldquo;Any such inspection or checking in respect of farms shall be carried out at the same time as the annual TB and Brucellosis tests and at no extra cost to the herdowner.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is central to the Bill. From today, every Irish farmer will require a permit to farm, although I note the Minister of State does not use that word. In order to get that permit, he or she must be visited by the local veterinary surgeon. This visit should be made on the occasion of the annual TB and brucellosis testing and the cost of the certificate should be included in the cost of the TB and brucellosis test, which is already quite a large sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no shortage of on-farm inspections. Farmers are inspected for REPS, headage and every imaginable reason. Some farmers are visited by a Department inspector six times or more in a year. When calves are sick, when cows are calving or when animals are being tested for TB or brucellosis, it is the local vet who attends to the animals. Every veterinary surgeon knows the <Col N="1395" /> farms he or she attends. No one is in a better position to write a certificate for a farm than the local veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State accepts this amendment. If he does not, I will put the matter to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>A plethora of inspections is carried out at all levels of the food industry and on farms. In the interest of minimising bureaucracy, the farm certification should be done by someone who is already part of the testing system. Whoever does the testing should be specifically trained in the requirements of the Bill. I support the idea of the local veterinary surgeon doing the test rather than having an additional set of procedures carried out.</P>

      <P>When this matter was discussed on Committee Stage it was generally felt that the inspection required by the Bill should take place on the same day as other tests. This would remove the need for an extra charge on farmers. As the Minister of State is well aware, the costs involved in having a vet visit a farm, particularly for those involved in the dairy, suckler cow, pig and poultry sectors, are enormous. The dropping of the proposed charge, therefore, would be very welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers on the proposed charge. Farmers complain that we in this House make the rules and regulations but we do not, they are made by the European Union. It is outrageous that the rules and regulations that we do make have to be sanctioned by the European Union. This begs the question whether this House is needed any longer, but that is a debate for another day.</P>
      <P>I agree there should not be an extra charge to farmers who cannot take any more. A war took place recently between farmers and the meat factories when it was proposed that extra charges be imposed. The proposed charge will put many farmers out of business. Given the red tape involved, farmers and their wives will have to employ three or four secretaries with a degree in agricultural studies in order to continue to operate in agriculture. This is a sad day for the industry which is being dictated to by the Civil Service and the European Union. One does not know what the other is doing. I am open to correction by the Minister of State but we are the first to introduce legislation in this area. As previous speakers said, we do not know from where the food we are importing has come. The Minister of State should inform us that he will not allow this extra charge to be imposed on farmers who, given current profit levels in the industry, are not in a position to sustain a further charge.</P>

      <P>I agree there should not be an extra charge, in respect of which every public representative has received representations. I find <Col N="1396" /> Deputy Naughten's reasoning very difficult to understand, however, that the inspection should be included with other tests. As with all professions, time is money. Given that farming is going through a bad period, I recommend to the Minister of State that there should not be an extra charge, that it should be incurred by the Department. I would be suspicious and nervous if vets were allowed to incorporate it with the cost of other tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly disagree that the cost should be incurred by the Department. Were that to happen the fear is that it would eventually be passed on to farmers. With the proper training, the annual TB or brucellosis test would present vets with an ideal opportunity to sign off on what is, in effect, a licence to farm. There will be turkey on the menu tomorrow in the cafeteria in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development; following the passage of the Bill it will be Christmas every day for vets given the charges that may be added on. The farming community is already finding it very difficult to survive given the additional charges being imposed daily by vets and the meat factories. The proposed charge is being slapped on top of these.</P>
      <P>On the licence to farm, has the Minister of State sought the views of the Attorney General and, if so, does the Minister of State believe that the Bill, under which farmers will lose their God given right to farm their own land which has been passed on from generation to generation, is constitutional? By how much will the price of beef increase per kilo and to what extent will this make Irish beef less competitive in continental Europe? They are the two critical questions which need to be answered.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to look again at the amendment which is well balanced and with which every Member agrees. It should be remembered that we are not being dictated to by the European Union on the Bill for which we have sole responsibility. I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to the amendment which has been discussed widely. As it is not my policy or that of the Department to impose hardship on the farming community I support the view that the ideal time to carry out inspections is at the time of the annual TB and brucellosis tests, but this should have the agreement of the farmer concerned.

      <P>In page 12, lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;to the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;orally to an independent self-financing appeal board based at county level&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment. The Minister travelled some of the road with us the last day on the question of an appeals board. The cheque in the post will now account for 53% of farm income. In this connection, what are the maximum penalties where an animal has lost both eartags? Fine Gael is seeking the establishment of an independent appeals board. This is not to cast an aspersion on the staff of the Department. However, they are in an unusual position because they are judge and jury. The Department imposed the penalty at farm level and, as the scheme is currently constituted, by and large it is senior people there who are deciding whether that was right or proper. I know that there is a European Union input into this also, but along with my party and no doubt every farmer, I want the appeal to be conducted by an independent body and I want there to be an accessible oral hearing. By accessible, I mean that I cannot see why a farmer in Kilkenny, Cork, Galway or Mayo <Col N="1398" /> should have to travel to Dublin to have his or her appeal heard. It should be done locally. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is able to conduct appeals locally and I see no reason that this should not be done locally.</P>
    <P>I have every reason to believe the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, may be inclined to accept these amendments and I will always bid &ldquo;fair play&rdquo; to a man when he deserves it. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, announced that there would be an independent oral appeal, but we seek its provision at county level. It is an administrative problem but there is no reason it should not be done. It is on that basis that I will put the amendment to the House, if I must, having heard the reply of the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>I told a story that day of where a father wanted to keep his son on the land and if I have time, I will recount it to the House. He leased a farm with sheds, accommodation and land five miles away and set him up with a suckling herd. When he was filling up the application form, in answer to the question as to whether he was associated with another herd, he stated he was associated with his son's herd and that the son was associated with his herd. As a result, the Department maintained that the herds were being mixed and one of the herds, that of the son, was disqualified. It is a shame, considering the father was trying to do a good turn for his son and keep him on the land.</P>

I hope there will be a change with this appeals mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the penalties relating to the tags, there have been situations in the past where, when there was a tag missing when a farmer brought cattle to the factory and the farmer <Col N="1399" /> returned later with the take to Kepak or the factory involved, the inspector kicked it into the bin and said &ldquo;Thanks a million&rdquo;. That is wrong and it should not happen. Farmers should not be penalised in this manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>More important than where an appeals system is based is the process of appeal. Last year's strategic management initiative committee report strongly recommended an independent appeals mechanism. The attitude of the Department up until then was that there could not be an appeals system because it would violate EU regulations. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, responded positively to the report of the SMI committee. The concerns of the committee, which I chair, were that there should be an independent appeals system, seen to be independent and trusted by the farming community and that it would relate directly to its client base. One of the things which stuck that committee during all of its deliberations was the minor issues on which people could lose their entitlements. The pedantic detail required of farming families is something which most Deputies could not meet. In fact, Senator Avril Doyle, who was Vice-Chairman of the committee, admitted that, notwithstanding the fact that she was a graduate in this area, she would have difficulties.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Naughten's point that when an appeal is made there must be a clear-cut response from the appeals mechanism. It must be seen to be credible and it must not simply be a reiteration of the earlier judgment.</P>
      <P>Having been Chairman of the committee which recommended it, I am pleased that there is a move towards an appeals system. Tremendous work has been done within the Department to try and humanise a system which in many ways has been inhumane. It was interesting that the senior EU personnel we invited before the committee paid credit to the Department and to the honesty with which the farming community has responded to EU schemes.</P>
      <P>I wish to see the appeals system up and running and dealing with its client base in a manner to which those clients adapt. The Department has gone a long way and this House could do so too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Roche's point. He is right. It is no wonder the EU officials were very complimentary of them because the Department always seemed to go against the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the inquiry of the Committee of Public Accounts, for example, when the politicians were being examined they were not examined by their colleagues; they brought in solicitors to do it. It is outrageous that this is the case in the year 2000. If this was brought before the courts, there would be a case against the Government. The farming community must deal with a junior or senior inspector and then there is a further inspector up the line. It is like in politics <Col N="1400" /> where the Minister's backbenchers will do whatever they can to defend him.</P>

I wish to inform Deputy Ring that on several occasions we have brought this to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, at our parliamentary agriculture meeting and he agreed with us.

      <P>This Bill is a welcome review of the planning and development code, which was initially enacted in 1963. It will consolidate in one Act all the planning and development legislation enacted since then. The Bill has the stated objective of making the planning system more efficient. With 245 sections arranged in 18 Parts and six Schedules, it presents an opportunity to address the serious deficiencies in the planning system. There are sufficient reasons, of which we are all aware, to update the planning laws. This alone would have made the Bill necessary, without it including a very important and significant section dealing with housing matters.</P>
      <P>The legislation proposed by the Minister has attracted considerable interest and controversy. The Long Title is indicative of intent and it will inevitably give rise to debate on the definition of the term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo;. Does it mean that all facilities will be located in the one location or does it propose to set out a way by which people can live and work in the same general area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was published the Minister and the Taoiseach said in a dictatorial tone that the Government was prepared to bulldoze its provisions through, even if it meant constitutional change. Furthermore, the Minister said the legislation would apply to all transactions made after 25 August 1999. This meant that he was prepared <Col N="1402" /> to oversee the introduction of retrospective legislation. I doubt if this is possible under law and I look forward to his views on how it can be applied to transactions that have occurred since last August.</P>
    <P>Planning should introduce certainty and consistency in the system. Section 4 provides that planning permission will be required for the cutting of turf and the planting of trees. This probably arises following the recent case of the EU Commission <i>v.</i> Ireland where we were deemed to have failed to properly transpose into law the 1985 EU directive. According to an article by James Macken SC, published last December in the <i>Bar Review,</i> the provisions of section 4 dealing with the thinning, felling and replanting of trees, forests and woodlands, will create confusion. The exemptions which apply at present will continue as long as the replacement of broadleaf high forests by conifers is not involved. This will undoubtedly lead to debate and litigation, especially in the midlands and the west. The timing of the initial planting period will also cause controversy and heartache in terms of its implementation.</P>
    <P>The current planning process is slow and tortuous. It does not lead to the fast-tracking of major developments contained in the national development plan, published in November 1999. The level of consultation required to deal with and implement some of the major proposals in the plan, especially the roads developments and the advertising of the procedures set out under Part X, will make the planning process very slow and this will be exacerbated by the low staff levels in local authorities, which are not in keeping with the scale of developments and numbers of applications coming before them. There were 1,800 applications to Kilkenny County Council in 1999, three times higher than the number five years ago. Yet, the resources available to the local authority have not increased. If more staff were to be deployed in this area other services would have to be cut back.</P>
    <P>The Minister must address the question of resources. How is each local authority to obtain the necessary resources to implement changes in terms of planning staff numbers and responsibilities if the requirements of the legislation are to be implemented? Local authority planning and engineering staff are scarce because of the buoyancy of the private sector. Hardly a month passes without changes in the engineering and planning staff, to the detriment of the service to the community. The Minister should carry out an audit of the difficulties faced by each local authority and the pay and conditions required to ensure that staff stay with public authorities rather than leave to work in the private sector, which is happening at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>The lack of infrastructural investment is a serious matter for local authorities, especially with regard to planning for housing sites. The huge pressure on large urban areas is exacerbated when account is taken of infrastructural short<Col N="1403" /> falls. For example, Kilkenny requires approximately £22 million to upgrade the water supply and £12 million is required to improve sewerage facilities in the villages outside Kilkenny city. This puts a huge strain on development requirements in towns and villages around the county at a time when demand by local people to live in their own area is unprecedented. The restrictions in the county development plan are even greater when it is considered that the Southern Fisheries Board rightly keeps a watchful eye on planning applications because of concern about the capacity of sewerage and water facilities to sustain it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is indicating that sustainable development is a prerequisite to good planning and development he has failed in his two and a half years in office to recognise the problems involved in places like Kilkenny. Not a sod has been turned in County Kilkenny to improve the problems relating to water and sewerage services since he took up office. Places such as Graiguenamanagh, Thomastown, Kilmacow, Urlingford, Freshford and Ballyragget are crying out for development, with developers anxious to work and young people seeking planning permission. However, there is a constant refusal by the local authorities to sanction these projects and developments because of the inadequate amount of infrastructure available in these locations, which must be addressed through direct State investment.</P>
    <P>Many statements have been made by the Government relating to the introduction of public private partnerships in order to mobilise private capital to assist local authorities in meeting the huge infrastructural deficit throughout the country. This is a huge challenge for the Government, and I am disappointed the concept of public private partnerships has not been implemented and that there is no indication when they will be fully operational under the Department of Finance. We need to know the criteria by which private investment could be mobilised to implement and build the necessary infrastructure as soon as possible if the objectives of the national development plan are to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am told that 8,000 acres have been zoned in Dublin for housing but that only 2,600 acres are serviced and that it will take three or four years before the remainder is serviced. This is an indication of the problems faced by local authorities in meeting the objectives laid down by the Government in terms of the housing needs of young married couples and in addressing the long housing waiting lists throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have encountered difficulties in terms of planning being caused by Dúchas which in places such as Kilkenny and Thomastown. It is disheartening that there are 3,000 applications with Dúchas and that nothing is being done with them in terms of processing the licensing arrangements required in respect of each application to allow planning and <Col N="1404" /> development to take place. This problem has been on the desk of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for the past two years and she has done absolutely nothing about it. In recent days we were told the Department will take on eight extra staff to deal with the backlog and allow new applications to be taken. How can there be planning and development in towns which have heritage of archaeological and architectural significance if there is insufficient staff to deal with the applications as quickly as possible? Dúchas is holding up essential work in many parts of the country. I am familiar with one such case in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, where a shopkeeper wanted to build a 12 feet by 12 feet extension. The owner applied for the necessary planning permission to the local authority and was told that the cost of an archaeological report, a necessary part of the application, would be £3,000. This is a serious deficiency in the provision of the necessary services required by the general public in relation to planning and development, and a more urgent response is required from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the strength of legislation protecting our heritage and architecture, but the necessary human resources must be put in place to allow local authorities cope with the additional responsibilities imposed on them through legislation relating to national monuments and our heritage which has been passed in recent years. We have lost too much that is of value from our past over the years and we cannot afford to lose any more. I am very worried that in the planning and development of our motorway system, which the Government is anxious to proceed with as soon as possible, we will have a coach and four driven through many major archaeological sites which have not yet been discovered. I hope the necessary expertise and staff will be deployed to ensure this does not happen, while still allowing for the developments to go ahead as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle will be aware that we can be critical of decisions made by An Bord Pleanála in terms of our planning experience in various off high street locations in Kilkenny city, where a number of historical artefacts were not protected to a sufficient extent. The walls of Kilkenny and buildings behind Patrick Street should have been saved and restored rather than plundered for short-term development gains and opportunities. On the other hand Dúchas is being irresponsible in terms of the undue delays in reaching decisions on planning applications. I ask that the legislation include a timescale setting out the response time of Dúchas to a local authority or planning applicant in relation to sensitive applications.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part II of the Bill which clearly pressurises local authorities to regularly review the development plan and which sets time limits of one year for the completion of the draft plan, of 16 weeks for the second round of public consultation and of eight weeks thereafter for the <Col N="1405" /> council to adopt the plan. This definitive procedure gives certainty to local authorities and the general public regarding the various stages of the development plan process.</P>
    <P>The strength of the economy and the pressure on major urban centres emphasises the need for greater use to be made of local area planning. I fundamentally disagree with the Minister in relation to his controversial objective of providing 20% of land for social housing and the manner in which he wants to implement that objective. Councillors and officials decide the zoning on land when the local authority is developing an area action plan, and they take account of the need for a social mix in terms of local authority or private housing. They also take account of the need for commercial and recreational opportunities in the area. The concept of area action plans must be enshrined more explicitly in the legislation in order to force local authorities and developers who are developing land to produce a strategic development zone for housing, in addition to industry as is proposed in the Bill. Section 190 deals with strategic development zones for industry, and I wonder why such zones for housing are not also included as they would mean that major consortia and developers could come to terms with what is required and be involved in the building a sustainable community. If the Minister is serious about sustainable development in practice, the action area plan process provides an opportunity whereby local representatives and people, in advance of a sod being turned, can be involved from the start to ensure we have sustainable development and a proper social mix. I suggest this approach rather than asking builders, through a sledge-hammer approach, to do something which will do nothing to reduce the price of houses or meet the social objectives of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great opportunity to implement a number of important measures, but he has missed an opportunity, particularly in the area of housing, to draw up a national spatial plan with most development in areas where people live and work being framed along the lines suggested in the Fine Gael document, &ldquo;The Plan for the Nation&rdquo;, and with public transport services forming a key part of planning and development, whereby pressure would be reduced in places such as Dublin which are already over-congested and where traffic jams are reducing the quality of life for people. The Minister should consider the Fine Gael proposals, which have been endorsed by the ESRI, to develop eight alternative growth centres, one of which I am glad to say is Kilkenny, in order to take the pressure off major urban centres and cities. Strategic development zones for housing and industry should be established and action area plans and indicative planning systems should be introduced so that industrialists and developers will know from the outset where and how they can develop. The community would gain because of the improvements in the quality of people's lives as a result of decentralisation to <Col N="1406" /> areas outside Dublin. The maintenance of parks and trade and recreational facilities should form an equal part of the index of quality of life measures which are important in order to keep young people in particular occupied and to reduce the level of crime. Further debate is required and amendments are needed to make the legislation more practical, particularly in regard to the controversial 20% social and affordable housing requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this major reforming legislation. There was a real need for this Bill as it consolidates nine Acts which have been introduced since 1963. It is also an essential aid to planners, local authorities, developers, administrators, the legal profession and the public. All of us recognise the need for an effective planning system in a developing economy to reflect the modern investment and development requirements of society.</P>
      <P>The Bill is timely as it follows a review and major consultative process with all those affected and it meets a specific commitment made by the Fianna Fáil Party in its programme for Government. I welcome the new and radical measures of this initiative which address major deficiencies in existing legislation, identify shortcomings which currently exist in the planning process and deal with new demands as a result of changed economic circumstances and personal housing preferences, particularly, the need for housing for low income families and social and affordable housing for those seeking home ownership.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides more open procedures, which will reduce controversy by responding to the needs of the community and developers and will also involve local consultation. It is important that it is drafted in a manner that is easily understood. General guidelines are necessary to deal with planning at local, regional and national level. However, it is essential that layers of administration are not created because delays, frustration and costs affect the end user. The house owner pays the price for such delays and I have never come across a developer who has borne these costs.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the national spatial strategy, which is under preparation, and look forward to the debate which it will generate on how it will influence development plans and regional guidelines. The debate will lead to a national understanding of planning objectives and methods, and not a fragmented and misunderstood set of rules and regulations, which exists currently. I look forward to the Minister outlining the progress of the strategy in his reply to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the planning system, which is covered in Part III. The problems faced by planning authorities are appreciated by everybody. Each one receives a huge number of applications, including Mayo County Council. It is also recognised that difficulties and delays are attributable to applicants as a result of inadequately researched and <Col N="1407" /> badly presented applications, which are sometimes accompanied by the minimum of supporting material. Such applications are inevitably delayed, but, nevertheless, every effort must be made to improve the operation of the control system. The local authority has a huge role to play in this as it has primary responsibility for the planning system. Representations made to national and local politicians and experience at appeal level provide evidence of the cause of frequent difficulties which arise in the system.</P>
    <P>The planning control system must be responsible for the public need and should reflect public aspirations. The community expects that high standards relating to safety, health and amenities will be applied to all new developments and it is entitled to expect that such proposals, regardless of size, will be processed reasonably and expeditiously and that employment opportunities will not be put at risk or deferred because of defects and avoidable delays in the planning system. This is simply not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Restrictions and prohibitions may be necessary if orderly development is to be achieved. However, the general approach to development control should not be unduly restrictive and permission should only be refused where there are serious objections on important planning grounds. The circumstances and merits of each case should be considered in the application of planning objectives. The system should also take account of the practical and human problems which arise in any system that affects the property and aspirations of the individual which are relevant to planning. There have been a number of problems in this area in Mayo, especially in regard to SACs where individuals experience difficulties in building a house on the family farm. The planning system does not take significant cognisance of this.</P>
    <P>A reasonable, flexible approach together with consistency and equality of treatment is required in the planning process. Rigidity and uniformity should not be the rule except in the case of clearly stated and understood national guidelines. The Bill needs to improve the reputation of the planning system and to achieve this it is necessary that the approach of all planning authorities to development control in housing and other developments should be consistent at all times. That is one of the most important elements of the planning system.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The last minute call&rdquo; in regard to planning applications for more information should be the exception rather than the norm. If a proposal needs to be adjusted to make it acceptable, that is as obvious the first day it is presented in the planning office as it is the day before the expiry of the time limit for a decision. Sadly, even in my county, it appears to be the norm that the day before a planning decision is due a telephone call is made seeking additional information. That causes a great deal of frustration for applicants and indicates that the application is not even <Col N="1408" /> examined until the time limit is about to expire. I do not know whether the reason for that is lack of staff or a huge volume of applications but, whatever the reason, it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Early assessment of all applications should be a feature of the control system which would facilitate early discussion to allow for necessary adjustments to satisfy the development objectives of the regional plan. It has always been understood that the control system must be flexible, allowing for reasonable discretion in its operation. In the first instance, the development plan is fundamental and essential in regard to development control. It must be basically sound and practical, clearly stated and presented and, most importantly, understood by the public and generally accepted as fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The sensible application of the agreed plan is another matter. Private interpretation on either side is divisive and punishes the credibility of the system. It also leads to a lack of harmony in the proper development of an area, which is the basic criterion of planning control. When the system operates properly the applicant or the developer and their advisers know where they stand in terms of proper planning principles, which should be articulated in development plans. It is unfortunate that currently when many applications run into difficulty, the applicants or their advisers seem to have no idea about the cause of the difficulty. If a plan has shortcomings and if the development control system operates in an unreasonable or arbitrary way, the outcome will be unsatisfactory and will result in the following: expensive appeals will multiply; developments will be delayed; overloading of systems will mean further delays; a cynical attitude towards the system will develop and a vicious circle will work to everybody's disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that third party objections to a planning authority in relation to planning applications is an essential safeguard in the fair and equitable application of the planning system. Consideration of objections on reasonable grounds is fundamentally democratic and just. However, it is not the purpose of the planning system to protect the private interests of individuals or provide a mechanism for resolving disputes between individuals about those private interests. The effects of proposed developments on adjoining property is a relevant consideration, but the net question for the planning system is whether the public interest or the common good would suffer if a particular proposal were to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Compassionate arguments may arise and relevant personal considerations should be examined, but planning applications should be dealt with on the basis of planning considerations and long-term benefit.</P>
    <P>The streamlining and the speeding up of the planning system is desirable to allow the necessary housing, commercial and other developments proceed with minimum delay. The Bill is reasonable and fair in the adjustments it recom<Col N="1409" /> mends in dealing with objectors and appeals. The revised provision dealing with outline permissions, if properly used, will be of considerable benefit in helping owners and developers to submit proper applications. The outline permission should be an instrument of certainty in support of the application for full permission and not used as a holding instrument to gain time for the control system by being vague, uncertain and ambiguous. Nothing frustrates the system more than ambiguity.</P>
    <P>Outline planning permission should form the basic advice to enable a speedy decision on subsequent proposals. That is not the experience in my county and, from listening to other speakers on both sides of the House, it appears to be the same in many counties. If inspections need to be carried out when a person applies for outline planning permission, the inspection should be carried out at that stage, not later.</P>
    <P>We recently had a planning conference in my county during which the county council planners explained a number of matters to us. One of the points raised was the whole area of outline planning permission and we were informed that outline permission was not a guarantee that one would get full permission at a later stage because the rules may have changed in the interim. Everybody knows that outline planning permission lasts for a period of five years, and that has to be borne in mind when outline permission is granted. Applicants go to enormous expense to apply for outline planning permission. The reason they apply for outline permission is to have a virtual guarantee that when they apply for full planning permission, they will get it. That is something that must be examined more seriously by local authorities and they must be aware when granting outline planning permission that a full application will be made on that particular location.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to one of the most interesting areas of the Bill, namely, housing. The supply of and demand for housing is the major social question of the decade. Home ownership is a cherished part of the Irish society model, and societal changes, cost and supply and labour force mobility are altering our traditional attitudes to housing. We need to facilitate the new demands of different sectors and to do this we must provide an adequate supply of social and affordable housing and adequate services &ndash; infrastructural, public and community &ndash; so that communities are better integrated. We must avoid isolation of housing schemes by sectors of the community. We have had some bad experiences of that in the past and they have given us ample reason for the need for lower density schemes and location variety in preference to large, grey, uniform estates.</P>
    <P>As a large proportion of planning applications relate to housing, it is important that the same general principles which govern the control of private housing development should be applied also to local authority housing developments. When planning permission is granted for a large estate for the private market, the developers <Col N="1410" /> come up with some wonderful ideas in relation to providing a piece of sculpture at the entrance to the estate and plenty of green areas, yet when it comes to building some council estates there appears to be no regard to this matter. It is simply a question of getting as many houses as possible on an area of land. That is unfortunate. The same principles that are applied to private estates must be applied to council estates. That is something local authorities will have to seriously examine in the future.</P>
    <P>Seriously prepared and presented proposals deserve the support and advice of the planning system, even if the proposal has planning defects. If the proposal is fundamentally flawed, it must be resisted but if it is not fundamentally objectionable, every effort should be made by the system to overcome the difficulties by advising the applicant as to the changes necessary to make the proposal acceptable. In certain local authorities there is very little communication between the planning authority and the applicant and many of the difficulties that subsequently arise could have been ironed out had all the necessary negotiation and consultation taken place.</P>
    <P>It is important also that adequate reason should accompany the advice and every effort should be made to minimise the delays and the costs attached to such advice. There is nothing more frustrating than to be told that one has to put a particular type of house on a site and use particular materials without being given a reason. The changes recommended by planning authorities can sometimes cause enormous expense to the applicant or to a developer, and it is not unreasonable that one would get an adequate reason that the particular change is being sought.</P>
    <P>Consultation, discussion, revised plans, modified plans and time extensions all take time and can often be frustrating for individuals and developers. The general principle should be to get it right the first time and avoid protracted negotiations and time and cost penalties. We should remember that in times of escalating prices, every delay has a cost penalty and it is the consumer, the individual home owner-house seeker who is carrying the load. In Castlebar we are experiencing a huge escalation in house prices where a six months delay in a housing application can sometimes add up to £50,000 on the price of a house. I am talking about a typical four bedroom house costing in the region of £150,000 to £200,000 in a small urban centre in a rural county like Mayo. What first-time buyer would be in a position to afford that much money? In many cases, a six months delay to a first-time buyer in those circumstances has put the house outside their reach. That is the reason the local authorities carry a huge responsibility in having applications approved on time.</P>
    <P>The system must try to avoid trial and error planning applications &ndash; repeat applications to try to find out what is and is not acceptable. The planning authority should endeavour to facilitate the applicant by indicating what is acceptable in <Col N="1411" /> accordance with fundamental objectives and not causing delays in pursuit of a simple location alteration on the same site. That is totally unacceptable. The emphasis should be on guiding and encouraging planned development rather than a rigid application of controls. That will require a positive attitude from the planning authority and a clear and unambiguous approach to development control and the works programme of the authority to housing and other developments. It requires a shared understanding between the planning authority and its professional planning office. This is achieved by debate and discussion at official, executive and council level. While development plans will have a six year lifespan, it is desirable that an annual discussion take place at planning authority level to consider progress reports and the implementation of fundamental objectives and output and thereby give full consideration to reviewing proposals rather than rush decisions to meet a statutory deadline. County councillors are democratically elected. They represent all sections of their community and they should have that say on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The demand for housing is affected by a growing economy, growing disposable income, interest rates, supply and cost of land, migration flows and shortages of building workers. We need to stabilise house prices now in advance of an inevitable slow-down of economic growth so as to avoid the possibility of negative equity in the housing market. We need to restore the balance to the housing market which can only be achieved by a significant increase in housing supply. The need is recognised in the national development plan. It is important that the gradual implementation of national plans is resisted. Infrastructural investment and the removal of constraints and delays to developments must be speeded up.</P>
    <P>In 1999, the Government spent £500 million on the overall investment in housing. We introduced a multi-annual programme for local authority housing and 22,000 new houses will be started over a four year period. We provided resources for voluntary housing and shared ownership and we introduced the affordable housing scheme. A fundamental objective of this Government is to maximise housing supply in all housing sectors. Therefore, we must accelerate the availability of land for housing and alleviate the constraints on its development.</P>
    <P>The planning guidelines on residential density, which were introduced at the end of September, will help efficient use of serviced land. It is important to look at the capacity of the building industry at present. There are serious labour shortages which are critical to the success of building objectives. We cannot build without labour. We have to examine building apprenticeships, what FÁS is doing and the Construction Industry Federation initiatives. We must take account of emigrants returning and where they are going to live.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> The shortage of serviced land is key to the housing situation. An initiative was introduced in 1997 and £100 million was provided. Some £39 million was provided by the Government while the balance was made up from development levies. This initiative will yield 100,000 sites by the end of 2000. Housing development should proceed in parallel with the land servicing initiative. Investment in programmes for water and sewerage in 1999 was £275 million. Some £930 million is at planning and construction stage nationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill. As every public representative knows, planning occupies a significant and increasing portion of their available time. This Bill is probably one of the key pieces of legislation to come before the House which will impact on the quality of our lives well into this century.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill is effectively two Bills in one. It is a reforming Bill but it is also a planning Bill with a housing Bill tagged on at Part V which deals with social and affordable housing. It has been tagged on to the Bill despite having its own distinct subject matter and a concise definition portfolio.</P>
      <P>This Planning and Development Bill will decide what this country will look like as it progresses through the first half of this new century. It will determine whether people will be in a position to access jobs and services in the areas in which they live or whether they will have to travel for hours each day just to get to work or to go to the local supermarket. The Bill lacks sufficient vision to ensure planning in the future takes account of the need to integrate housing with services and adequate infrastructure. It fails to address the serious quality of life issues which are under severe strain because of the pressure we are placing on our existing infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In the past 40 years or so we have moved from a predominantly rural based society to an urban based one. However, we are not equipped to support a heavily urbanised society. The general quality of life for the majority of people, particularly those living in large urban centres, has declined. We now spend longer going to and from work. Traffic problems have become so chronic that we must now endure traffic jams on Saturdays when people go to shopping centres or swimming pools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as urban society battles for a house in which to live and a parking space for their cars, some parts of rural Ireland are closing down because they do not have the industry, the infrastructure or the services to sustain the population. The critical question is, what will this Bill do to rectify this glaring imbalance? The Bill does not provide a solution to the diverse problems of urban and rural society. There are no safeguards to ensure communities can continue to live in a safe clean environment where there will be a complete integration of the service and leisure facilities which they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> The Bill is restrictively confined in its understanding of planning to a purely physical aspect. No effort is made to integrate the physical planning with the wider social, economic and environmental objectives. It is based on an antiquated concept that we live in one place, work in another and play somewhere else and travel by car between them. The new challenge will be to integrate these functions of living and to bring work, living and leisure closer together. This requires the elimination of the onerous task of travelling long distances and bringing about the necessary improvements in the quality of life. This essential ingredient of integration is missing from the Bill &ndash; the integration of the physical planing concept, building and development, with transport.</P>
    <P>The railways provide an important link and we had a discussion on them earlier. In my county, we had a rail link between Mullingar and Athlone, the two principal towns, but it was closed some years ago. It should be reopened as it is only natural link between the two principal towns of the county. We have the MullingarDublin railway line and all we have to do is to reopen the small stations. We have a reasonably good service, although it could be improved. By reopening the small stations such as Killucan, Hill of Down and others along that line, we could take hundreds of cars off the road. This would have considerable positive implications and would help to alleviate the build up of traffic at Lucan and the M50 coming from the west to the east. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, would be very aware of that. If that was integrated in this Bill, we could make a positive contribution to eliminating the worst aspects of environmental pollution and help to ensure people would not be stuck in traffic jams and would get to their place of work more easily. It would make it easier and much more pleasant for people from Counties Westmeath and Meath to travel virtually danger free to work in Dublin and the eastern counties generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill is essentially about the regulation of the building component and transport remains the responsibility of somebody else. That this Bill attempts to consolidate numerous Acts &ndash; nine in all &ndash; European directives and various planning regulations introduced over the years is a welcome development for all concerned. It is better to have cohesive legislation. As a barrister, I know it is extremely difficult going from the 1963 Act to the 1976 and 1997 Acts and so on. All laws should be consolidated; it is an anachronism and an antiquated concept to have people going from one Act to another. A legal person may have the ability to do so but what about lay people? They have rights and should not have to go to the local solicitor or whoever to establish their rights. They should be in black and white in consolidated legislation. Many of the legal anachronisms and the antiquated language is also a bar to people establishing and asserting their rights.</P>
    <P>Decisions on planning applications are effectively made by the individual planner who has <Col N="1414" /> considerable power. Often a decision is made on a planning application which is totally at variance with what the public representative, who participated in the drawing up of the county development plan, would expect. One might be compelled to ask how can this happen. The answer is that the planner is omnipotent in expressing a personal or a subjective view of what constitutes proper or appropriate planning and development for that area despite the fact that the public representative and the public would have had a major input into the country development plan. That is the nub of much of the dissatisfaction with planning decisions. It is the people who help to formulate the county development plan, the public representatives and the public. It constitutes an environmental contract with the people, but it can be circumscribed. As the planners will say, they have to have recourse to the planning legislation and to the 1963 Act, as the base legislation.</P>
    <P>An aspect of this Bill about which I have a concern relates to the erosion of the role of elected members of local authorities. In the new procedures for the preparation of draft development plans, elected representatives will have the right only to make recommendations to the manager. In the consideration of the draft plan, the council will no longer be supplied with copies of the submissions and observations made by the public but only with a summary of these submissions prepared by the manager, who will submit them to the council in what is called a manager's response.</P>
    <P>Time limits are being imposed on councillors in other sections of the Bill. Some of these are as little as one week and various penalties can be imposed where these limits are not met. The manager, for example, is given the right to make the plan without the approval of the council and, in certain circumstances, the council can be removed from office by the Minister and replaced by a commissioner. These provisions have the most profound implications for local democracy and are the equivalent of the imposition of a top down planning code rather than a bottom up one with the Minister having an excessive level of input.</P>
    <P>National spatial plans are important in overall development. How will the country develop in terms of housing, infrastructure and linkage with the national rail network? How will growth centres be designated? That is a critical question. I was at a very interesting conference in Kiltimagh last Friday at which there was a very lively discussion on this topic. My own capital town of Mullingar, situated in the centre of the country, is an ideal strategic location with an excellent and improving road network, including the N4, N6 and N52. That town should be selected as a growth centre to take pressure off the larger urban areas. All the facilities in such growth centres must be developed. I call on the Government to consider building a regional airport in the Mullingar-north Westmeath area.</P>
    <P>The idea of growth centres is useful, but only <Col N="1415" /> provided they do not lead to an over concentration of resources in one area at the expense of or to the detriment of the surrounding areas. There must be a proper coherent, strategic and complementary plan to ensure a significant increase in infrastructural resources for rural areas and the areas that surround such growth centres.</P>
    <P>How will development in rural areas be managed? What transport links will be created? How should smaller towns and rural villages be developed? How can we plan for the development of airports for regions such as the one I proposed for the Mullingar-north Westmeath area?</P>
    <P>A spatial plan is being considered and we got the initial documents on that. However, it should have been initiated within the past two years and at least have preceded the publication of the national plan and it could have been considered in the context of the blueprint plan, which was the national plan for infrastructural expenditure and development.</P>
    <P>The House should have direct responsibility for drawing up the spatial plan. One of the committees of the House should hear submissions on it from the public to ensure a proper public consultation process as in the case of local development plans and county development plans. I understand my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, will initiate a procedure on that. It is important that this Bill represents a blueprint on planning.</P>
    <P>We are living in a rapidly changing society where infrastructure cannot keep pace with the demands for housing, services and transport. A new planning and development Bill should address the needs of people and offer new ways to structure transport services, facilities and building programmes to meet those needs in a way that respects the environment and offers people maximum convenience in gaining access to a service and to their places of employment.</P>
    <P>The way we plan and develop our country needs to be underlined by a new vision, one which is underpinned by a will to address quality of life issues for people living in rural and urban Ireland. My home county of Westmeath provides some of the best examples of urban pressures and rural depopulation. Planning and development strategies of the past did not adequately address the need to make rural Ireland more accessible by means of better transport and new incentives. Addressing that need would remove some pressure from urban centres, which do not have the necessary infrastructure, facilities and services to support the rapid growth of population.</P>
    <P>In many respects, this Bill updates the existing planning laws by giving effect to new practices that have been introduced as a result of local area plans and so forth. The effect of tidying up existing practice in legislation is welcome in so far as it will assist in making the planning process more efficient and, I hope, more effective. However, <Col N="1416" /> the biggest barrier to ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning process is the lack of staff and resources in local authorities. Will the Minister of State confirm if the number of planning staff in local authorities has been increased in line with the increase in the number of planning applications? From my experience it appears that staff resources, particularly in the area of planning, are far from adequate to cater for the current demands of the planning process. Morale and pressure of work in planning offices throughout the country has become a serious issue. The major increase in the volume of work with which they are expected to deal is forcing qualified and experienced planners to move to the more lucrative private sector. One could not blame them for moving to that sector as salaries there are significantly higher. This is a critical issue. Approximately 300 professional planners are currently employed by local authorities. There is no point in enacting legislation that will impose more obligations and allow for greater participation, which we all support, if we do not also make provision for increasing the number of staff in local authority planning offices to deal with same.</P>
    <P>While 774 planning applications were submitted to Westmeath County Council in 1994, almost 2,000 planning applications were submitted in 1999. The staff in the local planning office are working flat out to deal with them. I pay tribute to the planning officials of Westmeath County Council planning office for the courtesy with which they deal with that significant amount of work under pressure.</P>
    <P>Our vision for planning and development should be underlined by a rural and urban plan which should be within the remit of each county council to prepare. Young couples, in particular, who wish to live in rural Ireland can find it difficult to get planning permission. Planners often have a subjective view of what they consider would be right for a particular area, which would often be in marked contrast to what I, as a spokesperson on agriculture and rural development, consider would be right. For example, a farmer would often be prepared to sell a site to a young person at a reasonable price because he knew that person's father or mother and would like that person to stay in rural Ireland to help build up a football team or contribute in some other way to the local community. Some farmers may have to sell sites to ensure the rest of their holding is viable. When such a planning application is submitted, a planner may grant permission on one site for a family member but stipulate that the rest of the farmer's land is subject to a section 38 agreement, a sterilisation agreement.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities have too much liberty to utilise the section 38 procedure to prevent developments in rural areas. In their own way they have contributed to the increase in the cost of <Col N="1417" /> sites and of houses which must be borne by young people, in particular, who want to live in rural Ireland. We must examine the section 38 procedure to ascertain if some restriction can be imposed on the ability of planners to utilise it almost at will to restrict development in areas. There has been a 30% fall in the population in some areas in north Westmeath, yet the section 38 procedure can be used to further restrict development in such areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise once again the issue of providing some form of grant assistance to people who move to a rural area and who invest in refurbishing a derelict house. I propose a once off grant of £15,000. The purchase of unoccupied homes in rural Ireland would go some way towards alleviating the housing crisis faced particularly by first time buyers who are being priced out of the market in urban centres. It would also act as a further important measure to prevent rural depopulation in areas, which the last census highlighted suffered a substantial population decline. This issue should be examined.</P>
    <P>Section 208 of Part XV deals with the licensing of events. While that section may have some merit, it fails to distinguish between the licensing of large sponsored events such as a major rock concert and a small local event such as the Mullingar International Bachelors Festival, the proceeds of which after covering expenses are donated to charity. That event is organised by a local group and provides local entertainment for the local community, especially young people. It would be scandalous if an activity such as that could not be held because it was circumscribed by a set of regulations. There is no point in the Minister telling me such regulations would apply only to this or that because, as a lawyer, I know that once regulations are imposed and archaic language is used, they discourage people from undertaking such activity in a community. The Minister should take careful note of that point. Such a licensing procedure could be used by local authorities to gain revenue, but it could discourage local events. I want to ensure that the Mullingar International Bachelors festivals and other festivals around the country of that ilk are protected.</P>
    <P>Section 34(11) deals with developers who have not completed work on estates. That section had its origins in the Labour Party Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 1999, proposed by my colleague, Deputy Ryan, in May. That Bill, if enacted at that time, would have facilitated a refusal of planning permission if in the opinion of the relevant planning authority previous contracts were not fulfilled and completed within a specified period and in accordance with all conditions in the planning permission. This obviously included a standard of work on the houses, the completion of roads and footpaths and the provision of public lighting.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Neville, Ahearn and Ring. Tomorrow, 8 March, is not only Ash Wednesday but is also national &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; day. It is, accordingly, appropriate that legislation published by me together with my colleague Deputy Stanton, on behalf of Fine Gael &ndash; the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; comes before this House this evening and will be voted on tomorrow night. I hope this Bill will be supported unanimously by all sides in the House and that it will not be opposed by the Government or the Independent Deputies on whom the Government's survival depends.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 20% of all deaths annually in the Republic are attributable to tobacco-related illnesses. That means tobacco kills between 6,000 and 7,000 people each year. Six times more people die prematurely each year as a result of smoking cigarettes than from car and other accidents, alcohol abuse, abuse of illegal drugs, murders, suicides, fires, hepatitis C and AIDS combined. In addition, many thousands more suffer from chronic debilitating diseases as a result of smoking.</P>
      <P>Smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable death in Ireland. It is a major cause of cancer, cardiovascular disease, strokes, respiratory illness, peptic ulcer disease, emphysema and accelerated bone density loss in women. Some 1,500 people die here annually from lung cancer. Smoking is a major causative factor in 95% of lung cancer deaths.</P>
      <P>Smoking during pregnancy can impact on foetal growth and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including increased incidences of low birth weight. Higher infant mortality occurs in mothers who smoke compared with those who do not. The incidences of asthma is higher among children whose parents smoke. It is estimated that a child ingests the equivalent of a 100 to 150 cigarettes a year just by being with a parent who smokes.</P>
      <P>Research has established that the mean survival of smokers is ten years shorter than non smokers. The earlier a person starts smoking, due to the addictive nature of nicotine, the more likely it is he or she will become a heavy smoker and will suffer a greater risk of diseases caused by smoking. Approximately one out of every three young people who become regular smokers die prematurely as a result of smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research has established that 80% of adult smokers who are addicted to nicotine commenced smoking under 18 years of age. The Department of Health's strategy for effective health care in the 1990s, <i>Shaping a Healthier <Col N="1419" />Future</i>, published in 1994, set a target to reduce the percentage of those who smoke to less than 20% of the overall population by the year 2000. In the course of work undertaken by me as <i>rapporteur</i> to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, in preparing <i>A Report on Health and Smoking: A National Anti-Smoking Strategy</i>, it became clear there was no possibility whatsoever of the State achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>While during the 1980s the number of smokers in the State reduced to the extent that 28% of people aged 15 and over smoked cigarettes, two baseline surveys of health related behaviour among adults and school children carried out in 1998 established that the decrease in the overall number of cigarette smokers had been reversed and that there had been a substantial acceleration in the growth of female smokers.</P>
    <P>The SLAN survey reported that 31% of the adult population smoke, with slightly more males &ndash; 32% &ndash; than females &ndash; 31% &ndash;  being reported as smokers. More alarmingly, in the 18 to 34 age group, 39% of the respondents in the survey smoked; 38% being men and 40% women. The HBSC survey of children between the ages of 9 to 17 years established that in 1998 21% of all children across that age group were smokers and that overall 34% of children in the 15 to 17 age group are current smokers. In that age group just under 31% of boys are smoking compared to 36% of girls. It is clear that if the present trend in youth smoking continues, the number of overall smokers in the population will continue to increase and within a relatively short period, the number of adult female smokers will substantially exceed male smokers.</P>
    <P>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children prepared by me as <i>rapporteur</i>, was unanimously endorsed by all members of the committee last November. This report concluded that the number of smokers in the State is escalating due to the substantial increase in youth smoking. The report labelled cigarette smoking as a paediatric disease. It is interesting to note that at his press conference today the Minister for Health and Children referred to smoking as a childhood addiction.</P>
    <P>The November 1999 report proposed that a national anti-smoking strategy be adopted by Government, stating that:</P>
    <P>It should be a central objective of health policy not merely to effect a global targeted reduction in the prevalence of smoking and tobacco consumption in the State, but also to entirely eliminate cigarette smoking and the use of other tobacco products by minors &ndash; persons under 18 years of age. Most people who suffer the adverse health consequences of using cigarettes begin their use before attaining 18 years of age. Only by preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke can we succeed in substantially reducing the overall numbers of smokers in the State within a reasonable time frame.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> The committee proposed a new national health objective:</P>
    <P>That smoking by all persons under 18 years be entirely eliminated by 2005 and that by that date adult smokers be reduced to below 15% of those aged 18 years and over.</P>
    <P>It should be a central objective of our national health policy to eliminate youth smoking. Elimination of youth smoking cannot be achieved by one single initiative. As the November 1999 report states:</P>
    <P>A comprehensive multi-faceted approach with a mixture of strategies is required to put in place an effective tobacco control and elimination programme.</P>
    <P>While it is an important measure, this Bill is merely one of the many initiatives required if we are to truly and properly confront the problem of youth smoking. I will now to turn to the provisions of the Bill and will then refer briefly to a variety of other initiatives required to eliminate youth smoking. I also want to put the Bill's proposals in context.</P>
    <P>As part of its recommendations for a new legislative framework relating to cigarettes and tobacco, the November 1999 report proposed that the current prohibition on the sale of cigarettes to under 16s should be replaced by a prohibition on the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. It also stated that it should be an offence to have cigarette vending machines in any premises into which any person under 18 years of age is permitted to enter or be present.</P>
    <P>The report recommended a number of other related changes in our law, of direct relevance to youth smoking, all of which are contained in the Bill before the House. Section 2 renders it an offence to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to any person under the age of 18 years &ldquo;whether for his or her own use or otherwise&rdquo; or &ldquo;to sell cigarettes to any person acting on behalf of a person under the age of 18 years&rdquo;. This section also renders it an offence to keep a cigarette vending machine &ldquo;in any premises frequented by a person or persons under the age of 18 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of these provisions, the age bar on the sale of cigarettes to children would be increased from 16 to 18 years. Moreover, the current fine of £500 which can be imposed for under-age sales of cigarettes is increased to £2,500. A person convicted of a second or further offence of the under-age sale of cigarettes is, under the terms of Bill, liable to a fine of up to £5,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or, as an alternative, can be directed by the courts to undertake community service.</P>
    <P>Surveys undertaken in recent years have established that a substantial number of retailers are ignoring the current prohibition on the sale of cigarettes to children under 16. The increased <Col N="1421" /> penalties which can be imposed on under-age sales by virtue of this Bill should ensure proper compliance with the law, provided of course that application of the law is properly supervised and enforced.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the November 1999 report, the Bill contains new provisions relating to age verification. The shopkeeper prosecuted for selling cigarettes to a person under age may establish in his or her defence that &ldquo;the person to whom the tobacco products were sold had upon request furnished to him or her&rdquo; a specified age verification document, confirming the purchaser to be 18 years of age or older. For such a defence to work, the court must be satisfied that it was &ldquo;reasonable to regard the documentation concerned as authentic and as applicable to the person to whom the tobacco products were sold&rdquo;. Similar provisions are in force in a number of states in the United States which have been effective in substantially reducing under age sales and ensuring that cigarette retailers are conscious of their legal obligation not to sell cigarettes to under age purchasers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 requires retail outlets which sell cigarettes, at the point of sale, to exhibit in a prominent position notices warning of, &ldquo;(a) the addictive and health dangers posed by cigarettes&rdquo; and &ldquo;(b) the age restriction on sale and the vendors obligation to ask for age verification&rdquo;. This provision also implements recommendations contained in the November 1999 report. It also replicates measures implemented in other countries seeking to confront the problems posed by youth smoking. By giving notice of the retailer's obligation to seek age verification, cigarette purchasers are warned that such verification may be sought and, when seeking it, retailers can point to the obligation the law imposes on them.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendation contained in the November 1999 report, a retailer who fails to exhibit the required notices is liable to criminal prosecution and to the imposition of the same penalties as can be imposed on a retailer who engages in under age sales. The Bill provides for regulations to enable the Minister for Health to specify the documentation that a shop retailer may rely upon for age verification and the nature of the notices which are to be exhibited in cigarette retail outlets. Under section 5 of the Bill, every regulation made under it must be laid in the usual way before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for summary proceedings to be taken in relation to any offences committed under it. Provision is also made for prosecutions to be brought by either the Garda or a health board officer, such as an environmental health officer. Section 7 provides for the repeal of section 3 of the 1988 Act, which renders it unlawful to sell cigarettes to persons under 16 years. Section 8 provides for the Bill to come into force one calendar month after its passing and section 9 contains the usual provisions concerning the short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health today launched a <Col N="1422" /> report commissioned by his predecessor, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. Many of the proposals relating to youth smoking contained in this report are similar to those contained in the November 1999 report. The measures contained in the Bill which is tonight before this House, if enacted, would effectively put in place the prohibition on the sale of cigarettes to under 18s and the controls on cigarette vending machines proposed in the report launched by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this Bill will not of itself solve the problems of youth smoking. It is merely one of the many initiatives required if we are truly to tackle the enormous health problems created by smoking within our society. If we are not merely to reduce but eventually to eliminate youth smoking a broad range of other initiatives is required. These are detailed in the November 1999 report which I also would include in the context of young people: targeted child smoking prevention and cessation programmes; the empowerment of and activation of a national anti-smoking, anti-tobacco youth organisation such as the one currently in existence in Florida State in the United States; explicit anti-smoking television, cinema and press advertising campaigns; a ban on all tobacco advertising, sponsorship and patronage; the free provision of nicotine replacement products to those who require them; provision for the imposition of a levy on tobacco companies whose cigarette brand or brands increase under age market share; the elimination of smoking in public places such as pubs and restaurants to protect children and adults from the health risks of passive smoking; annual increases in tobacco taxes in excess of cost of living increases; and active enforcement of smoking prohibitions and controls.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that in response to the provisions contained in the November 1999 report the Minister for Finance increased cigarette taxes by 50p for a packet of 20. It has been established that young people are price sensitive and that the more expensive cigarettes become the lesser the number of young people who commence smoking. This was also acknowledged by the Minister today. It is, however, disappointing that the Minister did not today commit the Government to an increase in tobacco taxes annually of 5% in excess of the rate of inflation as proposed in the November 1999 report and as called for today by the National Youth Council.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that during the tenure of the present Government there has been no effective multi-media anti-smoking campaign to discourage children and adolescents from taking up the habit. The Government will this year receive £1 billion in tobacco taxes, £130 million of which alone derive from the 50p on a pack of 20 increase announced in the last budget. In 1999 the tobacco companies in Ireland alone spent in excess of £7 million on tobacco advertising and sponsorship. In 1999, a mere £250,000 was given to the health promotion unit of the Department of Health for its anti-smoking campaign. I am <Col N="1423" /> calling on the Government to allocate immediately the funds required to launch, in the first half of this year, an effective anti-smoking television and cinema campaign similar to the campaign so successfully launched in Florida State in 1998. It is disappointing that the Minister has today made no commitment to such a campaign.</P>
    <P>Many millions of pounds are spent internationally by tobacco companies on cigarette promotion. Such international expenditure also substantially influences young people in Ireland. For example, tobacco sponsorship of Grand Prix racing is designed to glamorise cigarettes and the cigarette smoker and to disguise the fact that cigarettes are the only consumable product sold by manufacturers in the knowledge that they will ultimately kill many of their customers. I am calling on the Government to require RTE when broadcasting Grand Prix racing and other sporting events sponsored by cigarette companies to carry, for free, appropriate anti-smoking advertising targeted at young people. It is disappointing that the Minister failed to announce today that the Government intends to impose any such obligation on RTE, despite the fact that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children called for one.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the work of the joint Oireachtas committee stimulated the Government into finally attempting to formulate an anti-smoking strategy. I welcome the fact that the report I spent six months compiling for that committee has finally galvanised the Government at least to consider what action should be taken by it. While I welcome publication of today's report in so far as it reflects recommendations contained in the November 1999 report, it is regrettable that the Minister has totally failed to bite the bullet on a number of crucial issues which must be addressed if we are to have a truly tobacco free society. The November 1999 report recommended that smoking be banned in restaurants and public houses. The Minister's report published today acknowledges that there is now &ldquo;irrefutable evidence that environmental tobacco smoke is a real and substantial threat to health&rdquo;. In advocating a change of attitude to smoking the Minister's report laments that &ldquo;the efficacy of our existing measures is compromised by social ambivalence towards tobacco use&rdquo;. Regrettably, the Minister appears today to have continued to endorse such ambivalence. Much of today's youth culture is centred around public houses and the joint committee acknowledge the reality that children between the ages of 15-18 frequently socialise in public houses, as do a large number of young people between the ages of 18-34, 39% of whom we know smoke.</P>
    <P>The joint committee also expressed concern about the health impact of environmental tobacco smoke, or passive smoking, not only on children but also on adults in both public houses and restaurants. It categorically stated that smoking should be banned in both public houses and res<Col N="1424" /> taurants. The Minister should explain to the House why he has failed to implement this important recommendation endorsed unanimously by the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Is he afraid to take on the political interests which need to be taken on to ensure such a ban can be imposed and properly implemented, as has occurred in other parts of the world?</P>
    <P>The November 1999 report set an identifiable objective of eliminating youth smoking by 2005 and reducing adult smoking to less than 15% of the population. It is also disappointing that the Minister's report published today sets no such clear objective nor does it expressly endorse the proposal of the joint committee to provide integrated, comprehensive primary and secondary school anti-smoking programmes that go well beyond the current programmes in existence. While the Minister promises the nicotine replacement therapy will be made available free of charge it is not clear when this will occur, when it will be made available or to whom. It seems from today's report it will be made available only to a limited number of people participating in smoking cessation programmes and will be subject to unspecified conditions. The Minister should immediately make tobacco replacement therapy products available freely to all of those entitled to free medical care under the general medical scheme and extend the drug payment scheme to such products.</P>
    <P>The Minister in response to our bringing forward this Bill announced at a press conference today various plans the Government proposes to implement to confront the enormous health problems posed by smoking. The Bill before the House is a litmus test of the Government's true commitment to take genuine action to tackle this problem. I believe the Government should this afternoon have gone further in the commitments made by it, but many will still welcome the fact that after almost three years in office it at last appears to have a policy framework which it proposes to implement. If the Government tomorrow night votes down this Bill, its credibility on this major issue will be seriously damaged and the press conference held by the Minister today will be seen to be nothing more than a crass political public relations exercise.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister responds he will indicate to the House that the Government will not oppose this measure, that it will be supportive of it, and that the completion of Second Stage of the Bill this week will facilitate the measure speedily going to Committee Stage to facilitate its enactment into law before the Easter vacation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Shatter for bringing the Bill before the House. It is timely, as the Minister recognised in choosing today to announce his policy in this area. I also commend Deputy Shatter, as should the House, for the work he has done in the Joint Committee on Health and Children on bringing forward the <Col N="1425" /> report and in doing pioneering work in an Irish context in looking at this important health problem. The National Youth Council's report on cigarette smoking among young people has policy proposals for action and is an excellent document. Much of the information to which I will refer is drawn from it.</P>
      <P>After countless campaigns over the years and the expenditure of millions of pounds by the State, proportionately more young people smoke, than adults. We all know that smoking kills and causes cancer and that smokers die younger. We have been listening to that for decades and those statements are on cigarette packets; they could not be much clearer. However, in spite of health warnings and the awareness that cigarettes are bad for people, young people continue to take up smoking. I welcome Deputy Shatter's work in this area.</P>
      <P>One third, or 33%, of those between the ages of 15 and 17 smoke regularly, in comparison with 31% of adults who are regular smokers, so more young people between the ages of 15 and 17 smoke than adults. Also, 80% of all smokers become addicted between the ages of 14 and 16 years, while more than 80% of those under 16 who attempted to buy cigarettes were successful in doing so, according to research, though it is illegal to sell cigarettes to people under 16. In addition, 50% of today's young smokers will die prematurely from smoking-related disease. It is estimated that a child ingests the equivalent of 100 to 150 cigarettes per year from a parent who smokes. Regular smoking by young people can result in chronic low grade respiratory symptoms such as coughs, bronchitis and asthma. This can result in absenteeism from school and can affect performance in sport. The Department of Health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthy Future&rdquo;, which was published in 1994 targeted reducing the numbers smoking by at least one percentage point per year. That target has not been reached.</P>
      <P>It is not by chance that tobacco is one of the most accepted and popular drugs in Ireland. The normalisation and social sanctioning of tobacco has allowed it to become a common part of the daily lives of young people. Despite its normality and prevalence, there are health implications associated with the use of tobacco that are only now being addressed on an individual and societal basis. Given that health in its broadest sense encompasses social, economic, mental and spiritual aspects as well as physical wellbeing, these implications are far-reaching. Smoking among young people is particularly worrying given that it is at that age that lifetime habits are set. Last year Deputy Shatter said the early initiation age of smokers, the addictive nature of smoking and the health risks of nicotine resulted in the FDA concluding that smoking is a paediatric disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tobacco is the only legal product in the world which, when consumed as intended, will kill half of those who use it. Given that scenario, it is no surprise that smoking is the single biggest cause <Col N="1426" /> of preventable death in Ireland; 80% of all smokers become addicted between the ages of 14 and 16 and the earlier a person starts smoking, due to the addictive nature of nicotine, the more likely he or she will become a smoker and suffer a greater risk of disease from smoking. Half of today's young smokers will die prematurely. Eight types of cancer are recognised as being caused by smoking, with lung cancer almost entirely caused by smoking. The other forms are cancer are those of the upper respiratory system, bladder, oesophagus, pancreas, stomach, kidney and leukaemia. Other potentially fatal diseases that are judged as being caused by smoking are respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive airways disease, pneumonia, stroke and heart disease, the most common cause of death in economically developed countries. In Ireland, smoking is a causative factor in 95% of lung cancer deaths, 25% of deaths from heart disease and approximately 75% of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema. Smoking is also a risk factor in non-fatal diseases such as peripheral vascular disease, cataracts, hip fractures, periodical disease and accelerated rates of post-menopausal bone density loss in women. These diseases cause appreciable disability, cost and inconvenience to the sufferers. As Deputy Shatter said, smoking during pregnancy can impact on foetal growth and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, limb reduction defects, stillbirths and increased incidence of low birth rate Approximately one hospital bed in ten in Ireland is taken by a patient with a smoking-related disease. Surveys of GP practices show that cigarette smokers attend more frequently than non-smokers. Smokers also have more acute and chronic illnesses, more restricted activity and more absenteeism from work. Research has established that the mean survival of smokers is ten years shorter than non-smokers. Involuntary inhalation of others' smoke is also a deadly risk, as it exposes the non-smoker to the same detrimental health impacts as are suffered by smokers. Non-smokers exposed over long periods to passive smoking have at least a 35% increase in lung cancer rates and are at increased risk of cardio-respiratory symptoms.</P>
    <P>Children are particularly affected by passive smoking. Recent research shows that parental smoking increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Every day young people are forced to breath environmental tobacco smoke, most often at home, with their childminder or in a car. It is estimated, as I have said, that a child ingests the equivalent of 100 to 150 cigarettes by being with a parent who smokes. Some of the results of children being exposed to environmental tobacco smoke are increased risk of lower respiratory tract illness, acute and chronic middle ear disease and possible hearing loss, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and phlegm, decreased lung function and asthma. For the majority of young people these symptoms will not materialise until later in life and are less likely <Col N="1427" /> to occur if they cease their habit. However, young people are still physically developing and can be greatly affected on a daily basis by the health hazards of smoking. Regular smoking can result in chronic low grade respiratory symptoms such as coughing, bronchitis and asthma, which can result in absenteeism from work and school.</P>
    <P>Nicotine is highly addictive for its stimulant and mood enhancing qualities. Many people use it on a daily basis as a psychological boost without which they feel they cannot function. There has been increasing recognition in Ireland that young people decide to smoke within a broad social context made up of individual factors and ranging to peer, family, community and media influences as well as legislative factors. The challenge of any initiative aimed at reducing the numbers of young people taking up smoking and drinking is to address all those components. Research shows that the most significant factors affecting whether or not young people take up smoking are advertising, sponsorship and promotion, education, availability of the product &ndash; which is being dealt with tonight &ndash; and the price of the product.</P>
    <P>The availability of tobacco is a key factor influencing consumption. The current law makes it illegal for tobacco to be sold to someone under 16 years of age, but Deputy Shatter proposes increasing this to 18. The present situation is out of line with other countries' provisions as well as our Child Care Act. However, the effectiveness of any law is determined by the certainty of detection and punishment as perceived by the general public. For legislation to be effective it requires frequent, widespread and publicly visible checks that the law is being kept. That is not always the case with tobacco laws in Ireland and there is strong evidence that the law in this area is being routinely flouted. Research shows that 80% of children under 16 can buy cigarettes. As law enforcers, environmental health officers have no right of entry to those premises selling tobacco and are not permitted to request offenders' details and these anomalies bring the law into disrepute. The legislation must be modified as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced a voluntary ID card scheme as part of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1998. Young people who want this official card confirming their correct age must apply to the Garda and the scheme should be extended to include the sale of tobacco products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to support this important Private Members' Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Shatter. This is the seventeenth Private Members' Bill introduced in this House by the Deputy. Four of his previous Private Members' Bills have already been enacted and there is no reason this Bill should not be the fifth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of the Bill is the 12 months of hearings by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on <Col N="1428" /> Health and Children on the subject of smoking and health, and six months intense research and drafting of the most comprehensive report by Deputy Shatter. The Shatter report entitled the National Anti-Smoking Strategy was launched in November 1999. The recommendations in the report were unanimously endorsed by the all-party committee and adopted without amendment. These included new health warnings on cigarette packets, new provisions requiring tobacco companies to disclose fully the ingredients in cigarettes, a ban on all tobacco advertising, sponsorship and patronage, new and increased penalties for violation of tobacco legislation, explicit anti-smoking television, cinema and press advertising campaigns and a prohibition on the sale of cigarettes to persons under 18 years of age. The Bill was introduced last November following the publication of the Shatter report on smoking and health. It seeks to give effect in law to one of the prime targets of the anti-smoking strategy, that is, preventing young people from becoming addicted to cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Health and Children has in his report, coincidentally published today, the day on which the Second Stage debate on this Bill is taking place, reiterated many of the Shatter recommendations, which I welcome. Having given several interviews on radio and television today and in interviews with newspaper journalists over the week-end, the Minister is sending a clear message that the sale of cigarettes to children under 18 years of age should be outlawed, as recommended by Deputy Shatter last November. It would be totally incomprehensible if, having stated repeatedly that legislation must be introduced to outlaw the sale of cigarettes to minors, he opposed Second Stage of the Bill. If so, he will be acting in a purely partisan and party-political manner and such an approach would be totally unworthy of the Minister. I hope he will not act in such a hypocritical manner. I am sure he will agree that this is far too important an issue to be turned into a party-political football. What matters to all of us is safeguarding the health of children and young people. Any delay in enacting this legislation would be totally unforgivable.</P>
    <P>We must all be fully committed to reducing the numbers of people who smoke. We must be prepared to take radical steps, no matter how unpopular, to influence and educate people on the dangers of smoking. We will have to develop almost a sense of fear, particularly among young people, of cigarette smoking. Deputy Shatter has shown this courage in initiating this debate and introducing this Bill in the House. I hope all of us as public representatives will follow his courage in this House tonight. It is our duty and obligation to convince smokers of the risks they are taking and the long-term damage to their health and to those around them who are under threat from passive smoking.</P>
    <P>No matter what efforts the Minister made today to upstage Deputy Shatter's Bill and to pre-<Col N="1429" /> empt tonight's debate, a decision to oppose the Bill would confirm that otherwise a Bill seeking to prevent the sale of cigarettes to people under 18 years of age would not have been introduced in this House. Nevertheless, I am confident the Minister will have the courage to show true leadership qualities by supporting the Bill tomorrow night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to speak on the Second Stage of the Bill. I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Shatter. As the previous speaker said, this is the seventeenth Bill introduced by the Deputy, four of which have already been enacted by the Dáil. No Minister for Health, Government or political party could say this legislation is not correct for this country at this time. I heard a rumour throughout the House today that the Government will not accept this Bill. I am sure the Minister will confirm or deny the rumour in the next few moments when he will get an opportunity to address the House.</P>
      <P>It will be an outrage if the Minister and the Government opposes this legislation tomorrow night. Deputy Shatter and the Oireachtas Joint Committee spent many days and months and put a great deal of effort and commitment into drawing up this report. All members of the committee and their political parties supported the report. When the report was launched on behalf of the Oireachtas Joint Committee all members were associated with it. It would be very wrong if the Minister, the Government, the Independent Members or anyone else opposed this sensible legislation. People are outraged when they see young people being sold cigarettes in shops, supermarkets or on the streets. This legislation will outlaw that practice. Tomorrow is Ash Wednesday and we will listen to the Minister and everyone involved in health care on every local radio station and RTE encouraging people to give up smoking. They will do so because smoking is bad for people's health. If young children of ten, 11 or 12 years of age see their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, cousins or aunts smoking cigarettes, naturally they will think this is the correct thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister opposes the Bill tomorrow night, the message he will be sending is that the Government supports young children smoking. There has been a great deal of talk in the past about this issue but legislation has not been introduced. Deputy Shatter has now put legislation on the table and I ask the Minister to indicate that he will accept it. The Deputy has thought long and hard about any legislation he has introduced in this House. He has worked hard on this and people recognise he is a man who thinks quality, shows quality and introduces quality legislation. If amendments are needed, they can be dealt with on Committee Stage. The Minister should indicate that he and the Government have the commitment, the will and the courage to support this legislation, that there will not be division on the issue tomorrow night and that all Members of the <Col N="1430" /> House will support what Deputy Shatter proposes. This will prevent thousands of people, including young children, from taking the deadly weed, cigarettes.  I agree with the Deputy about the national media, including RTE, TV 3, TG 4 or so on. When covering sporting events, particularly motor car racing, if cars carry advertisements or if participants carry advertisements on their vests, television stations should give a warning that smoking endangers health and kills people. I say to all sporting organisations that they should not use money from tobacco companies to promote sport because sport, smoking and bad health do not sit well together. Sport is supposed to help young people to keep fit and to become involved in their communities. Statistics show that if people smoke 20, 30 or 40 cigarettes a day they will not live as long as those who do not smoke. The Minister should be brave. He is a new Minister, a new face and when he speaks in a few moments he should say that he will accept Deputy Shatter's Bill. If so, I will be the first to congratulate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Mary Hanafin. I commend Deputy Shatter on his Bill and his determination to keep the tobacco issue at the top of the national agenda. I thank and pay tribute to Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, who has also been very active on this issue. Both are absolutely right in being so.</P>
      <P>Ireland has thousands of children, addicted to a substance that will kill half of those who cannot get free of the addiction. That is a national scandal. We are becoming very good at examining the conscience of the past: good at condemning those who either abused children in the past or failed to intervene when abuse was going on.</P>
      <P>Fifty years from now, when they examine how we took care of our children, I do not want people to say we stood back and let them get hooked on a killer substance. I want them to say that Ireland accepted the World Health Organisation's definition of tobacco use as a global epidemic, that Ireland commissioned a set of guidelines to help us become a tobacco free society and that we acted on those guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, this morning, I published the Report of the Tobacco Free Policy Review Group, which was established by my predecessor. I was asked by those concerned to make sure that the initiatives were published in time for Ash Wednesday. That group was asked to carry out a fundamental review of health and tobacco and to make recommendations to the Minister for Health. What emerged this morning, was an extensive action programme to further a policy for a tobacco free society. The timing is important. Ash Wednesday has, for many years, been the day when anti-smoking campaigns were launched because Lent was traditionally the time when smokers tried to give up, at least for a few <Col N="1431" /> months. Today is the day when the smoking issue is top of the agenda for many people.</P>
    <P>The report of the Tobacco Free Policy Review Group is substantial and detailed, as might have been expected. It does not deserve the kind of carping criticism it received this evening. We should work together on the implementation of the contents of that report. It is also blunt, clear, accessible and interesting. It looks, not just at tobacco use in Ireland, but breaks down that use into important issues including smoking by gender and current smoking prevalence among children. It also takes a blunt look at the industry and at responsibility and accountability for tobacco related illness. The report offers us a blueprint for immediate, sustained and tough action against the use of tobacco. We need that because we are not making a big enough dent on this massive problem.</P>
    <P>Smoking is a childhood addiction. In the past, campaigns set out to prevent teenagers smoking. The majority of smokers are already addicted by the time they reach their teens. Huge numbers of 11 and 12 year olds are getting hooked on something that will kill half of them. As many Deputies know, tobacco related illnesses kill half of those who use tobacco.</P>
    <P>The report gives us guidelines on which to base action, but its recommendations are not a general shopping list, but a much more realistic set of actions. The report says, for instance, that there is no point in banning cigarettes: what would result from a ban would be a flourishing black market. Instead, it says, four linked actions need to be taken and sustained. Number one, we have to change attitudes towards smoking. At all levels, we have to make smoking unpopular and uncool, not by attacking smokers, but by changing the way we all think about smoking as an activity.</P>
    <P>The second set of actions in this report recommends supporting people trying to quit smoking. Eight out of every ten smokers want to kick the habit. Many of them try and fail, but they try again and we need to put specific supports in place to help them get away from the addiction. The third set of actions relates to the environment. We need to strengthen environmental controls on smoking. Last but definitely not least, we need to rescue the children. We need to prevent them from starting, and help them if they have already started.</P>
    <P>I will move on the recommendations of this report immediately. Later, I will present to the House the outlines of what I plan, in promotional and legislative terms. However, I will first put those plans in context. For many years, Ireland has been a leading advocate for the worldwide control and ultimate elimination of tobacco use. We were one of the first countries to introduce restrictions on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the industry. These measures were later adapted for the whole of the European Union and are now the gold standard, internationally. <Col N="1432" /> Ireland was also one of the first countries to recognise the impact of environmental tobacco smoke and to prohibit smoking in public places. That is leadership of which we can be proud and which we need to continue.</P>
    <P>In aiming for a tobacco-free Ireland, it's important to be unequivocal. Tobacco kills in many different ways, none of which are easy. Not only does tobacco kill, but it has no benefit for smokers. Occasionally a flurry of stories appear suggesting that nicotine might have some protective function relating to some disease. Smoking tobacco in pursuit of any of these alleged health benefits carries a risk of other diseases outweighing any perceived benefits.</P>
    <P>As a lifelong non-smoker, I am reluctant to appear too biased against tobacco, so I will concede that it is a useful pesticide and can be quite a decorative plant but that is all. There are no other benefits. There are no benefits to smokers. Tobacco use holds nothing for human beings other than addiction, financial cost and devastating disease.</P>
    <P>If we look at the alternative, a tobacco free society would offer us freedom from addiction, more money in our pockets, and avoidance of some of the grimmest self-induced illnesses known to the medical profession. That is why it is worth aiming for a tobacco-free society. It has been put to me on the air that this is an unrealistic ambition, that it would not and could not happen, but the history of public health is full of inspiring stories of impossible dreams coming true by hard work, and through the dedication and commitment of many people.</P>
    <P>Some of our older Deputies remember a time when polio was a dreaded disease, shadowing every child's summer holidays. Now within one generation we are within reach of completely eradicating this disease. Nobody could have imagined that success story at the time, just as nobody could have imagined that we would beat back TB, diphtheria or tetanus. We did because we did not focus on the difficulties, but on the results we wanted and we did not fool ourselves that leaving ourselves open to getting diphtheria was an aspect of our personal freedom.</P>
    <P>For too long, we have allowed the promotion of death and disease under the guise of personal freedom. There is something infinitely sad about citizens cherishing the right to slowly kill themselves. That kind of talk and the suggestion that a tobacco-free society is an unrealistic objective is music to the ears of the tobacco industry. For that reason, I want to nail the popular myth that Government is prepared to collude with the tobacco industry because of the contribution cigarette taxes make to the economy. The reality is precisely the reverse. I do not care what impact on the Exchequer aiming for a tobacco-free society would have. It is the only moral objective we can have, as a Department, as a Government and as a society.</P>
    <P>Another myth is that if the facts are presented, smokers will instantly stop smoking. Any smoker <Col N="1433" /> knows that will not work. Not only is nicotine a powerful addictive chemical, but the tobacco industry for generations has pumped so much money into the promotion of their products that a few facts &ndash; no matter how shocking those facts may be &ndash;  will not roll back the power of that spend. The tobacco industry has not only spent money like water, but has also used psychology in a sure-footed and cynical way. According to a confidential marketing document generated by the world's leading tobacco company: &ldquo;A cigarette for the beginner is a symbolic act. I am no longer my mother's child. I'm tough. I'm not square. As the force from the psychological symbolism subsides, the pharmacological effects take over to sustain the habit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is what we are fighting &ndash; the most malignant marketing force in history, with a death toll in millions and the tobacco industry has known for a long time that its products were killing people. If one reads the history of tobacco, the first warnings were sounded loud and clear, not years or decades ago, but centuries ago. Scientific evidence took longer to arrive. This is where the &ldquo;Big Lie&rdquo; came in. The industry looked at the evidence that cigarettes could kill, and said that there was no scientific support for it and it was all coincidence. For the first half of the last century, the industry kept the jury out.</P>
    <P>That changed mid-century, and one feature in a popular magazine, <i>Reader's Digest</i>, convinced people to become concerned about smoking, and doctors began to cut back and to stop smoking themselves. The tobacco industry responded with speed and sensitivity &ndash; sensitivity to markets rather than to the truth. Sophisticated public relations campaigns were put into action. Vague assurances about good intentions were circulated. Filter cigarettes were introduced and the industry skilfully marketed them as &ldquo;safe&rdquo; cigarettes.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that the industry deliberately frustrated independent scientific research into tobacco. Where they could not frustrate the researchers, they confused the people who read the published research. The industry outspent and out manoeuvred the public health community to win public support for its deadly products.</P>
    <P>Recent revelations from the United States of America have renewed public concern about tobacco and exposed some of the sleazy behaviour of the industry. We now know the industry suppressed scientific data it did not like. Having done so, it took another step and embarked on worldwide marketing to children. I quoted one of the documents which shows precisely how the industry set out to snare little children. It is brutal, cynical and offensive but, tragically, it has been successful. It is mind boggling that any adult would willingly set out to addict children to something he or she knew would cause them disease, distress and death. It is frightening that the industry did so systematically and successfully.</P>
    <P>Past performance is the best indicator of future behaviour. It will take more than ingratiating <Col N="1434" /> words to persuade me that the tobacco industry has changed. It is an industry that must be subject to the closest regulation and scrutiny in the future. The insidious approach the industry has traditionally taken is to cast the tobacco issue as a human rights concern. The tobacco industry says the public health community is attempting to interfere with personal freedom when they oppose a free market in this product. It argues that it is an adult choice. This is nonsense.</P>
    <P>More than 80% of smokers start and become addicted long before they reach the legal age. In relation to the current legal age of 16, Deputy Shatter and I are at one in regarding the current legislation as too lax in this area. All the evidence is that smokers begin smoking at a much earlier age, so it is not an adult choice. Once addiction is established, the individual cannot be regarded as exercising free choice when he or she continues to smoke and they know it because over 85% of smokers would like to quit but find it too agonising and impossible to do.</P>
    <P>The industry is falsifying the position. Smokers have rights, and these are the right to know what is in a tobacco product; the right to know the harm smoking can do to them; the right to know that smoking is one of the most difficult addictions to break; the right to be protected from this product when they are children; the right to know about the harm environmental tobacco smoke causes to those around them, especially their children; and the right to have their addiction recognised as an illness and to be treated. Their final right is infinitely sad; if smokers are unable to break their addiction, they have the right to continue to smoke. The evidence now emerging suggests that these rights have been habitually and deliberately violated by the tobacco industry. It is time to cut through the smoke rings of spin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and the members of the Oireachtas committee, chaired by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, have kept this issue to the forefront of our attention. The Bill is being opposed not because the Government opposes some of its contents, but because I have already instructed my officials that a new miscellaneous health provisions Bill is to be published in two weeks. The age at which a person may be sold cigarettes is a distinct priority in this Bill. The age limit will be raised to 18 years and the fines will be increased to £1,500. We have been advised that this is the upper limit in relation to the fines that can be levied in this area.</P>
    <P>The office of tobacco control, which is being established, and the Department have been instructed to prepare a comprehensive tobacco Bill which takes on board all the issues relating to tobacco such as vending machines. These machines may be prohibited under the new Bill, but I want to consider the matter in greater detail. The Bill before the House mentions restrictions with regard to vending machines but it may be necessary to go further.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive tobacco Bill will deal fundamentally with the issue of full disclosure of the <Col N="1435" /> contents of cigarettes in terms of additives, etc. There are no regulations in that regard at present in Ireland or elsewhere in the European Union. In terms of environmental controls, there is a need for additional legislative powers to increase the number of public places where smoking is prohibited in the future. There is also a need to consider the issue of enforcement and compliance with existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The report published today is the result of comprehensive work undertaken over two years. This work creates a template for comprehensive legislation to deal with issues raised in the report and other reports that have been produced. The Government has committed itself to banning packets containing less than 20 cigarettes. This issue was also identified in the report.</P>
    <P>Our collective responsibility is to the children who are being sold an addictive poison as a way of proving their coolness. I want to work with all parties in the House in trying to develop the agenda and move it forward. Regarding indirect advertising, which some tobacco companies have utilised to avoid the ban on more direct advertising, the report recommends that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands review the code of ethics for broadcasters. This will be followed up with the Minister and the national broadcasters.</P>
    <P>Regarding the education programme, the report signifies a significant change in terms of the financial resources that will be made available for a public relations campaign on tobacco. Last year the Department of Education and Science produced the comprehensive Walk Tall programme on substance abuse. This very good programme is being run in almost all schools at this stage and it will be supplemented with campaigns by the health promotion unit. It was important to publish the report. One cannot criticise the Government for inaction and then criticise it for publishing a comprehensive report.</P>
    <P>The report outlines a management framework for sustaining the initiative. There have been too many stop-start campaigns and the office of public control will be a vital element in terms of delivering the programme. The tobacco free council will be particularly important and the Department's health promotion unit will have an enhanced role in terms of the public campaigns. A satisfactory template is in place to progress the agenda.</P>
    <P>It is not envisaged that there will be any signage of any sort in relation to tobacco in any retail outlet. The report contains many recommendations on how retailers market cigarettes next to confectionery at the counter. I assure the House of my bona fides in relation to the contents of today's report. There is a need for a comprehensive tobacco Bill. Deputy Shatter acknowledged that the Bill before the House deals with only two or three issues. A Health (Amendment) Bill will be published in two weeks and there are logistical issues in terms of whether there should be two <Col N="1436" /> Bills before the committee at the same time. That is not necessary but I assure the House that the Government supports the idea of raising the age limit from 16 to 18 years. The Bill before the House does not deal with the full gamut of issues but I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with young people and teenagers, when there is a conflict between what is healthy and fashionable, fashion will always win. If there is a battle between power pressure and peer pressure, the peers will always win. In the debate about smoking and not smoking, when one is dealing with young people, smoking will always win. Unfortunately, over recent years, society has allowed this to happen. We as legislators, the tobacco companies, advertisers, parents and particularly young people have allowed a situation to develop where smoking is not only a fashion but a cult and an addiction. We are all responsible for this position.</P>
      <P>Having spent many years teaching, I witnessed at first hand the extent of smoking among young people and particularly among young girls. It was no surprise to me to read in the report of the tobacco free policy review group that 31% of all women smoke, but that 40% of the 18 to 34 age group smoke. The report highlighted the point that the problem is acute among the 15 to 17 age group, a group with which I dealt for many years. It is frightening to read a report which mentions addiction from the age of 11 years. If we were talking about an addiction to any other substance, we would have dealt with the problem many years ago. What is more relevant by way of statistics, is a report by the Eastern Health Board of health behaviour of school pupils which showed that 51% of 12 to 14 year olds and 70% of 15 to 18 year olds in schools in the area had smoked and that the younger the boys and the older the girls the more likely they were to start.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the influences on those young people who smoke. Undoubtedly peer pressure is the number one influence in the case of young girls. The aim of teenage girls to have a shoe size which is bigger than their dress size means they are constantly watching their figures and diet. Smoking is one way, which they see, of keeping the weight down and is one of the reasons teenage girls smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a society where it is important to succeed it is in vogue among young people to indicate that they are under pressure, even in those students where there is no pressure from themselves, their friends or their families in relation to their junior or leaving certificates. Smoking shows a person is trying to calm his nerves and is under pressure responding to the demands of society which demands success. To be daring, a student will go on to the fire escape, down behind the convent graveyard or on to the football pitch to smoke <Col N="1437" /> during break time and lunch time. To be sophisticated at the disco or club one has a cigarette in one hand and a glass in the other. It is unfortunate that cigarettes are the cheapest status symbol available. Money is no object for many young people. It is not just a question of charging more &ndash; and I would welcome that &ndash; it is a whole culture among the young people which has to change.</P>
    <P>That culture must also change among parents. Parents who smoke cannot say to their young people, &ldquo;Do not do as I do, do as I say&rdquo;, because that does not work. Parents are role models for young people. It has been proven and is stated in the various reports that children of smokers are twice as likely to smoke. Parents become very tolerant of smoking because they convince themselves that the child could do worse, that it could be an addiction to something else. They accept smoking as the lesser of a number of evils. This culture and attitude has to change.</P>
    <P>The attitude of all those leaders of society must also change. Schools talk about the education courses, health education, on my own two feet, walk tall and all the available courses and yet ignore the students who smoke on school premises although they are not in the building. Those same schools will take students away for weekends and on school tours abroad and will turn a blind eye to the fact that they all smoke in the hostels or wherever they happen to be on the tour.</P>
    <P>Smoking is not tolerated on buses. Yet young people still smoke on the top of buses because there is no conductor to go up and find them and the driver cannot leave his seat to find them. The smoking habit is creeping in on our public transport.</P>
    <P>One is almost encouraged to smoke in pubs where no differentiation is made between smoking and non-smoking areas. At least that distinction exists to some degree in restaurants, although I discovered last night that the non-smoking area was beside the door and that most of the people in the smoking area did not smoke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>At least a differentiation is made whereas in pubs there is none. People who smoke lose their sense of taste and smell. When they leave the pub they and their clothes have the lingering smell of smoke on them. Advertising has become so sophisticated that one no longer needs to mention names. The advertisement in the magazine does not mention the name of the brand, it just shows the cut through the silk; that says it all. The advertisement mentioned here, Formula 1 racing, the vending machines and the newspapers, is highly sophisticated, well targeted and influential. What was frightening on a recent visit to China was that the tobacco companies, recognising that the markets may be in danger in Europe or in the United States, have targeted the Chinese young people and show advertisements which seem to suggest that smoking stands for <Col N="1438" /> freedom, independence and America. That type of influence was used by them to ensure they could not only encourage young people to smoke but lead them on to addiction. That addiction means that in all schools there is an increase in the use of inhalers because young people have more asthma and respiratory problems than heretofore. It is affecting their sense of smell and taste and the figures for the rates of mortality in Ireland, the smoking related diseases, are evident.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that if death certificates made it clear the cause of death was a disease related to smoking more accurate figures would be available. Each of the groups mentioned needs to be targeted to ensure we can wipe out this addiction. The report published today focuses on those groups and on those people. I would like to see more being done at primary school level not only in the case of the courses being provided but in the overall culture and attitude in a school. Many schools offer a range of extra curricular activities. Why is it that in fashion shows in which I participated with my students, all the girls who were more than half my age were less than half my width and proud of it? Their aim is to fit into a size six or size eight dress. Why do not the selectors of the models focus more on poise, walk and presence rather than have them try to look anorexic? </P>
      <P>We will have to focus on parents to ensure they do not tolerate smoking as the lesser of two evils. Smoking is not comparable to drugs in the sense of a heroin addiction but it is an addiction and needs to be targeted. I look forward to the Minister's legislation targeting the sale of cigarettes, the amount that can be sold, the price at which they can be sold and the advertising of same. Unless we focus on the young people and make them realise it is a drug and an addiction we cannot help them to change their attitudes. The battle against tobacco is one of the most important battles we will face as a Government and as a department of health. Tobacco consumption is a burden to individuals, to young people though they do not realise it, to families and society through death, illness and medical costs.</P>
      <P>The report published today, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, will set out the strategy and will help to change attitudes and support those smokers who want to quit. It will also protect society against passive smoking and smoking and, more particularly, it will focus on children. Though it does not come within my remit as Minister of State with special responsibility for children I hope to assist the plan in some way in dealing with young people to wipe out this addiction at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Stagg and O'Shea. I compliment the Minister for Health and Children. One difference which is evident over his predecessor is that he has got a new speech writer. Nobody would disagree with what he and the Minister of State have said. He deserves high marks for colour. I like the <Col N="1439" /> phrase &ldquo;smoke rings of spin&rdquo;. However, only a small number of specific measures are outlined at the core of the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>I am perplexed by the speeches of the Minister and the Minister of State. Both speakers are in Government and are in a position to deal with this very serious problem yet they are unable to accept the basic and practical measure which is presented by the Opposition. We have heard much about the problem of smoking. We all know the problem and we share the views expressed by the Minister and the Minister of State. However, the Opposition has presented a practical measure which could be adopted by the Government, if only as a gesture of goodwill. The acceptance of this Bill would show that this question is not to be treated as a political football. The Bill is a modest one but it is to the credit of Deputy Shatter that a valuable body of work has been presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Efforts to tackle the problem of smoking have had limited impact. While there has been a reduction in the number of people smoking since the 1970s the number of young people, and particularly young women, who smoke is now increasing. The slight decline in the number of older smokers is very welcome but the number of women smokers between the ages of 18 and 24 is now greater than the number of male smokers of the same age.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to concentrate solely on young people and children. We must examine the issues of addiction and of class. Medical card holders are more likely to be smokers than those who are not. The class basis of good health practice is evident in the SLAN report and we should not dismiss it. It is good to emphasise the issue regarding young people and that issue must be addressed. Legislation may not be the answer to the question of young people smoking. Banning an activity may often make it more attractive to young people.</P>
      <P>While the document produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is a very important one, an aspect of the problem was not given sufficient prominence. We must address the needs of the 20% to 30% of our population who have been smoking for many years and who are now suffering the consequences of that. Most of these people suffer an addiction which can be stronger than the addiction to heroin. We all know colleagues, family members and friends whose health is breaking down as a result of this addiction. The only treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is to give up smoking cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Martin is responsible for health as well as for children. He has mentioned the 85% of smokers who wish to give up smoking but he has not said how he intends to deal with this aspect of the problem. There has been an over-emphasis on legislation and not enough on a programme to deal with the medical conditions which result <Col N="1440" /> from smoking. Previous Governments have also failed to face up to the nature of this addiction. There has been an over-reliance on lecturing people who know only too well that they should not smoke.</P>
    <P>We have made considerable progress in dealing with heroin addiction. It is greatly to the credit of the previous Government that good practice was established and alternative therapies provided, without judgmental strings attached and free of charge, for heroin addicts. If smokers were harming people besides themselves, would more effective Government action have been taken? The relationship between heroin addiction and crime was undoubtedly a factor in persuading society to deal with that problem. Why has a similar effort not been made to deal with addiction to tobacco which is doing so much damage to so many people?</P>
    <P>Twice as many people could become non-smokers by using nicotine replacement therapy yet this is not available through the GMS or on the drugs refund scheme. Why can we not do something practical to enable people to give up smoking? Nicotine patches can have a beneficial impact on many people. Why do we not incorporate these therapies into the national anti-smoking strategy? </P>
    <P>Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of cardiac disease and lung cancer. If lung cancer is detected early enough it can be treated but there is no screening programme for this condition which targets smokers. Some members of the medical profession are of the opinion that the diseases of smoking are self-inflicted and that sufferers from them are less entitled to treatment than others. Would we tolerate any other group of citizens being poisoned in this way? Change is required in the way we view this high-risk group of people who require screening, treatment and help to overcome their addiction. We need to adopt a different strategy; we need to adopt a humane and people centred approach to ascertain what will work rather than ban advertising. We need to ensure children under the age of 18 are unable to access cigarettes. We all know someone who is addicted and who may in every breath they take, be conscious of the fact that they are seriously addicted and have no way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that tomorrow is Ash Wednesday and the Minister availed of the opportunity to highlight his approach to combating smoking. It is also International Women's Day. It has to be noted that women are particularly vulnerable, not just in the ways rightly indicated by the Minister of State. I suspect that it would be much more effective to ask Weight Watchers to conduct a mass campaign in schools than try to convince women that they should not have a cigarette in their hand to keep their weight down.</P>
    <P>A study conducted in Norway in 1997 clearly showed that women tend to have a genetic predisposition &ndash; we always seem to get the rough end <Col N="1441" /> of the stick &ndash; to lung cancer, even when they smoke less. Studies in the United States indicate that by 2002 lung cancer will kill twice as many females as breast cancer. There is a major breast cancer problem here. This indicates a trend. We are not just talking about children and the chronic addict therefore, we are also talking about the risk factors relating to women.</P>
    <P>There is a need for commonsense on the question of increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes. There is a huge range in the cost of cigarettes across the European Union. I understand the Greeks pay least and smoke the most. That is to be expected but the second heaviest smokers are the Danes who pay most. We have to be careful therefore that we are not just depending on cost or dealing with advertising; much more has to be done to ensure the factor of addiction is also addressed in terms of medical practice.</P>
    <P>The February 2000 report of the Royal College of Physicians in London states that cigarette smoking should be seen first and foremost as a manifestation of nicotine addiction and every bit as addictive as hard drugs such as heroin; that all actions aimed at curbing smoking should flow from this recognition of nicotine's central role in the compulsion to smoke, and that if smoking is primarily a nicotine addiction nicotine replacement therapy must be a central plank in treating smokers.</P>
    <P>We must ensure treating the addiction of smoking is recognised as part of medical practice and that the resources provided for health boards are directed not just at encouraging the creation of tobacco free environments or controlling the sale of cigarettes but also at the training of nurses, general practitioners and local communities to ensure that when an addict decides to give up smoking the resources, in terms of replacement therapy, and personnel with the necessary skills are in place to ensure he or she moves forward in the same way that a heroin addict works through the stages. I know of heroin addicts in my community who are moving through methadone to real life, to the point where they will have a job, settle down and have a family, and kick the habit once and for all. That is what we need to concentrate on in terms of tobacco addiction. I ask the Minister to recognise the needs of these sick people in terms of their addiction and its likely outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As a cigarette addict, I warmly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I do not enjoy or wish to be a cigarette addict. I am among the 85% who would like to kick the habit. At long last we are in a position to devise a comprehensive national anti-smoking strategy. I strongly support the comments of my party colleague, Deputy McManus, on this subject. Unlike her, however, I can speak from personal experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tobacco industry is one of the most destructive and insidious in the world. It has lied, concealed the truth and destroyed the health of <Col N="1442" /> hundreds of thousands in the pursuit of avaricious and more avaricious profit. It has exploited Third World countries for their raw material while poisoning the populations of countries, rich and poor. The international political economy of the tobacco industry is disgusting, exploitative and deserves condemnation at every hand's turn.</P>
    <P>In trying to reduce the incidence of smoking here and across the European Union we should not forget that the tobacco industry will not hesitate to move on to pastures greener in its efforts to generate profits. As Deputy McManus stated we have to realise that reducing smoking in the rich western world will lead to an increased assault by tobacco companies on poorer countries which may have less legislative and public health resources available to them to take on the tobacco companies in the way I hope we will in coming years. We should recognise this fact and immediately exchange our strategies for combating smoking with poorer countries. The globalisation of international capital is one of the most powerful forces in the world today. It is a force which drives the tobacco industry and we have a duty to reinforce this point at both bilateral and EU level.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to challenge the Minister on one aspect of the Government's anti-smoking policy, that is, the withdrawal of a cigarette allocation from patients in psychiatric hospitals. Why did the Government decide to launch an attack on some of the most vulnerable in society in an effort to flex its get tough policy on smoking, which I welcome?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I have smoked all my adult life and made numerous attempts to kick the habit but failed. I have used hypnosis, patches, ear studs and acupuncture without success. I know the real pain and sacrifice involved in kicking the habit and the real strain it places on a person, even in good health. I cannot understand for the life of me why the Government decided to withdraw the cigarette allocation to a group of citizens, many of whom are at their lowest ebb and least able to cope with cutting down or giving up cigarettes.</P>
      <P>I know what the effects of this policy will be. In many cases patients' behavioural controlling medication will be increased. A sudden and drastic cut in cigarette consumption will increase irritability and anxiousness. Increased medication will be used to treat this. It is a short-sighted policy which attacks the most vulnerable in the community. It should be dropped and a proper anti-smoking campaign instituted in psychiatric hospitals rather than the blunt instrument introduced at the stroke of a pen by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cigarette smokers are addicts. Instant withdrawal without preparation and an individual making the conscious and voluntary decision to try to quit the habit will not and cannot work. Yet, that is what the Government has tried to force on the residents of psychiatric institutions. <Col N="1443" /> It fails to understand the nature of addiction and the vulnerability of many psychiatric patients. It was a shallow, cruel and vindictive move. I urge the Minister to reverse this decision immediately or to make a cash allocation to patients who wish to purchase cigarettes. Because of the price of cigarettes the minimum extra allocation required in this regard will be £25. I ask the Minister to seriously consider this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the Labour Party's Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which provided for the standard of work on houses, the completion of roads and footpaths, the provision of public lighting, the taking in charge of estates, the dedication of open spaces and the implementation of the relevant health and safety standards for building workers during the construction period, which would be a necessary part of any planning Bill. That Bill also provided for the condition in a planning permission of payment of a financial contribution to the planning authority for the development of community facilities, including buildings and football pitches, for the benefit of the community of the area within which the proposed development is situated. It also provided for house purchasers, who suffered loss or damage due to the failure of the person who secured the planning permission to comply with the condition of that permission, to bring an action for damages and costs.</P>
      <P>The problem of unfinished estates has always been on the agenda of residents' associations and meetings in my constituency since I was elected, and I became a public representative in 1984. There are many good developers, but the few who leave estates finished inadequately or unfinished do a grave disservice to those who do a good job. Young people wonder how a developer can get away without completing an estate within a specified time period and be granted permission on another site shortly thereafter. One of the common problems is that lighting and footpaths are not put in place in time and people with young families are not able to push buggies on those roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 34(11) is a welcome advance but it is a little diluted in so far as one must seek recourse to the High Court. If a developer does not carry out his work, surely he should be told he will receive no further planning permissions until he <Col N="1444" /> completes the work? There is no need for recourse to the High Court in these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill. Planning in general in the Wicklow area is an unbelievable problem and there is much controversy and division over the least matter. Increasingly, individual planning applications are being adjudicated upon by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Apparently it is the intention of the Bill to adopt a more inclusive approach at draft stage of development plans. I welcome and encourage this measure as it will not only reduce controversy and so-called secrecy around the making of a development plan but I hope it will ease conflict, which can arise quite often due to lack of communication on the part of council officials and members. If we are to be serious about this proposal, however, additional staff will be required.</P>
      <P>I read that out of date plans will not be a feature in the future. This is an idealistic statement but it is unrealistic. I do not see how it is possible to consult widely with the public and have development plans adopted within a strict timeframe, and I would like to know how this is to be achieved. With a lack of planning staff in many local authorities, all too often outside consultants are being employed, at the expense of something else within the county, to deal with development plans.</P>
      <P>Often public consultation and deadlines do not go hand in hand and if a situation were to arise whereby the elected members of a local authority miss a deadline as a result of a matter of local public interest, an extension should be granted on that occasion. This situation has arisen before with Wicklow County Council in the course of the Greystones town plan, where the members had genuine difficulties with certain aspects of a plan, namely, the population projections for the area, yet we were treated like schoolchildren who had misbehaved when we sought an extension of time.</P>
      <P>I note that planning guidelines will be drawn up at regional level, and I welcome that, provided it is not simply further red tape. I need not point out that Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, which is the county of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, are under extreme pressure at present with planning applications and development needs due to the ever-increasing housing crisis in the greater Dublin area. I want a clear commitment before agreeing to any proposal to draw up regional plans that these plans will not in any way detract from the status of county development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drawing up of county development plans is practically the only power which county councillors still possess. Given that these are drawn up by local elected members of the area and the public consultation process is to be widened further, <Col N="1445" /> county plans will increasingly be drawn up by the public. It would be disingenuous to provide for wide public consultation on county development plans only to find that they are overshadowed by a regional plan.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Bord Pleanála, I do not know where to begin. It is a faceless, secretive organisation. The only thing I can say in its favour is that politics has been removed from its decision-making process. It is no longer in touch with the people whose decisions it affects. It ignores county development plans and it assumes the authority of Dúchas, the heritage service. Recently it made decisions on natural habitats in Kilcoole which would conflict directly with Dúchas's decisions and recommendations. What is the brief of these people? Surely they are bound by certain guidelines and codes of conduct. We should use this opportunity to outline exactly what should be their brief and make them more accountable. Surely they should give explanations as to why they overturn recommendations of their own inspectors, as was the case on Bray Head. A great number of planning decisions are made by this secretive organisation, yet it is not accountable to anybody. Many other public bodies are slowly being made more accountable, especially in terms of planning decisions, and rightly so, and An Bord Pleanála also must be made accountable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the right of appeal is reserved for those who have originally objected to the planning application at local authority level as it will accommodate the genuine objector and distinguish him or her from the people who object to planning as a hobby. However, the downside to that decision is that more correspondence will be directed at the county councils. Not all this correspondence will be from those objecting, but many will make an observation at local level because, should the decision affect them, they will want to have their name on the record early. Again, I highlight the fact that more planning staff will be required to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to charging a fee to people who make an objection at county council level, I am not convinced that a fee should be introduced. I fear the only effect this will have is that county councillors will be put under extreme pressure to object to certain planning, assuming that councillors will not be required to pay such a fee. The excuse being used is that this money will be used to employ enforcement officers, but that is ridiculous. Enforcement officers should be employed by local authorities without charging a fee to help pay their salaries. Surely it is not the responsibility of local people to pay for the policing and safeguarding of planning laws. It is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure that the environment is protected and that people who are flaunting or breaking the planning laws are prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The fact that planning decisions are to be made within eight weeks rather than two months will <Col N="1446" /> have little impact on delays unless the staffing numbers are dramatically increased. The usual delaying tactics will be used. The only change will be that the letters seeking further information, time extensions etc. will be sent a week earlier. Allowing four weeks to assess further information is impractical. It is crazy to think that planners, health officers, engineers, Dúchas, those in charge of water reservoirs etc. can properly adjudicate on further information in such a limited timeframe. In those circumstances they would be unable to give full consideration to additional proposals in planning cases.</P>
    <P>Formal pre-planning discussions would greatly help the planning process in theory, but yet again I stress that these will only work when extra planners are employed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed development contribution schemes and I hope that strict guidelines are made and clear commitments given with regard to the spending of these moneys by county councils. The levies and bonds must be realistic and I hope the practice in the past of allowing developers get away without paying the contribution levied will cease.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attempt to control builders who failed to comply with previous permissions. I am sure this will cut down on the number of unfinished housing estates and will improve the quality of life for residents. I welcome the proposal that the money from fines imposed by the courts should be put back into the planning area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister uses this opportunity to clarify the procedure which should be adopted by local authorities when dealing with anonymous letters regarding planning applications. If these anonymous letters contain certain allegations, as has been the case in Wicklow on a number of occasions, surely the county council involved should not be obliged to keep this type of unsubstantiated material on a file, where it is possible for the public to view it.</P>
    <P>The lodging of a retention application will not prejudice the taking of enforcement action. This is welcome, but I hope local authorities will be required to exercise common sense in their approach. There would be little point in taking somebody to court over a minor offence when they are making a genuine attempt to rectify the matter through a retention application. I note the Minister's intention to appoint a commissioner to take over the role of the manager or members or both where there is impropriety, serious inefficiency or non-compliance with statutory requirements. I hope this will not be yet more red tape that will further hamper the planning process or erode councillors' virtually non-existent powers.</P>
    <P>There are many more provisions in the Bill which are long overdue and welcome, such as the 20% contribution requirement on developers for social housing needs. These have been commented on in detail and there is, therefore, no point in dwelling on them. I urge the Minister to ensure that staffing levels are improved because <Col N="1447" /> it is the only way to ensure the positive proposals in the Bill are implemented and the position on the ground can be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>This Bill revises and consolidates the nine local government planning and development Acts enacted since 1963. It also introduces a sustainable development philosophy to the planning system. It is time the Acts were consolidated and it will make it easier for those involved in planning to follow the terms of the legislation enacted. During the last general election campaign we made a commitment to review the planning code and the Minister is now implementing that promise.</P>
      <P>Politicians will confirm that planning problems are high on the list of problems we encounter at our clinics and on the telephone. A problem we face in tackling issues raised is that different planners will give different advice. For example, one planner will advise against a proposal because it will destroy the skyline, another will say it will destroy the colour scheme of an area while another will say it will impinge on density requirements. The application of different standards and criteria is a cause of great distress, not only to public representatives, but to those seeking permission.</P>
      <P>The tendency towards uniformity will make the countryside less interesting and destroy its uniqueness. This is not to say that certain uniform conditions should not apply as these are necessary to prevent water pollution or housing developments in the wrong areas.</P>
      <P>I am not a member of my local county council, so I must speak as an outsider, as it were. Yet, it is clear to me that many decisions are nonsensical. Cork County Council's previous development plan prohibited permission for development within three miles of a town or a village to cut down on ribbon development. While this was to a certain extent necessary it has been taken to an extreme. The council has recently decided that the provision would not apply to the Bantry area and I understand the next development plan will abolish the provision completely. However, this plan, which was due in 2001, has been deferred to 2002. I do not know why but it is unacceptable. I am glad the Bill provides that development plans will last for no longer than six years and cannot be deferred.</P>
      <P>All county councils face staffing problems. I do not blame them for many of their decisions because many of them are under severe pressure as a result of increases in the number of applications for planning permission. While this is a positive reflection of the economic upsurge, staff resources in planning departments have not kept up with the demands made on them. For example, two or three years ago about 50 applications a year were submitted in Youghal, but in the last two years the numbers have increased to over 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem is the rate at which planners <Col N="1448" /> are moving from the public to the private sector. The Construction Industry Federation is advised by a leading planner who is on leave of absence from a local authority &ndash; a strange partnership. Another leading planner has left the local authority with which I am familiar to go into a private consultancy. These developments illustrate the demand in the private sector for planners, but it makes it difficult for local authorities to make wise decisions. The problem must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose raised the question of sterilisation of farms. Planners are demanding that if a farmer sells his site or gives it to a son, daughter, nephew, niece, grandson or granddaughter, the rest of his land should be sterilised, even though other family members may be involved. I am not in favour of this and I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála has caused grief and concern to many people over the years. Do the members of the board have to register their interests in the same way as Members of this House, Secretaries General in the Civil Service, judges and so on? They should be required to do so because of their important role in the development of society. The board made a decision on the proposal by the ESB to erect pylons from Aghada to the island off Cobh and across Cork Harbour. An Bord Pleanála acknowledged at a meeting that it would hold an oral hearing. However, refused to do so and I wonder why. It seems very strange that having said it had no objection to an oral hearing it did not go ahead and hold one.</P>
    <P>Another example of why I am concerned about An Bord Pleanála relates to a constituent who sold a property, next to which he had a site worth between £30,000 and £35,000. There was no objection to his application to the county council for development of the site, but there was an appeal to An Bord Pleanála by the person who bought the adjoining property, and the appeal was upheld on the grounds that a house on the site would destroy the skyline. If anybody bothered visiting the area they would have seen there are a number of houses further up the hill behind the site and that development on the site could not have destroyed the skyline. Some public representatives made representations to An Bord Pleanála, but I do not know whether this affected the decision. However, the decision was very unusual, especially as the person who bought one part of the property then offered the ridiculous price of £5,000 for the adjoining site. The site was later sold for a fairly reasonable price. It raises the question of why a person from An Bord Pleanála did not look at the site in question.</P>
    <P>There should be regional boards in Munster, Connacht, Leinster and Dublin which would include individuals familiar with the areas in which they are making decisions.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Ó Caoláin. This is a wide ranging Bill and one could speak about it for two or three hours, and I am sure many Members would like even longer. In the context of planning and development there is need for good order, curtailed planning and imaginative development of the places in which people want to live, work and play. Hopefully, this would enhance the environment, thereby enhancing people's lives and reducing the stresses and strains of everyday life, which should be the ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>I am the first to appreciate that one man's meat is another man's poison and that often beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I am a member of Galway County Council and only recently we introduced a new five year development plan. We had 30 or 40 meetings in rural Galway, and as many issues came up at the beginning as at the end of the process. Like this Bill, it is a matter of trying to get the various competing and conflicting demands into a sensible arrangement.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Ahern said, there is no doubt that some people would build anywhere if they got a chance &ndash; they would build in the middle of the high road &ndash; while another group would object to any development, no matter what it was. Getting the right balance is a fair job in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will shorten planning delays, but nobody should think this is a panacea in terms of addressing the housing shortage, particularly for young couples who will be monitoring the progress of the Bill and who might think they will be able to get an affordable house in a place in which they want to live. Unfortunately, I see no end to the housing shortage while there are more buyers than there are houses being built. Little will be achieved unless much greater amounts of serviced land are provided much faster. Like selling cows or sheep, it is a matter of supply and demand, and while there are more people wanting to buy houses than there are houses being built, we will have the huge problem about which everybody in the House knows and speaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding delays in planning permission, in a womb to tomb context, that is, from project initiation to project completion, we are talking not about two, four or six months but two or three years. It is remarkable that as a result of all the messing it can take so long to develop a small estate or even a single house. We understand about the two month duration for planning applications, but never in the history of county councils have there been so many applications for planning, and I must say that while sometimes planners get under my skin, something I am not shy of telling them when necessary, they are under a huge pressure of work. Unfortunately, <Col N="1450" /> whether they are caught in the middle makes little difference to the people whose lives are affected by delays. The most annoying thing is that a day short of the two month period being up, applicants for planning permission often get a registered letter saying that further information is sought. This can be the result of two things. It is possible that the initial application was not fully complete, something I will return to, but more than likely the planners have not been able to deal with the volume of applications and are forced to say yes or no to the application, and when in doubt they seek further information. This results in more trouble and another two month period. Much of the time a decision is left until the end of the second period. The public deserves a better service from planning offices to ensure that we keep pace with the fantastic development which is taking place, even in many of the small rural areas about which I will speak.</P>
    <P>There should be pre-planning advice for all potential buyers and builders, but currently I do not think county councils are in a position to supply it. It is harder to get an opportunity to meet with a planner in many county councils than to submit planning permission given that it can take so long to organise a meeting. On meeting them, the question is whether development can take place in a specific area. Usually the answer is that it looks all right but that a decision can only be made on an application which is submitted, not on what is said at a pre-planning meeting. There is a huge need for an increase in pre-planning consultation. It is also necessary that the interpretation of the county development plan should be uniform. In some counties one group of planners has a different view of the development plan to another and that must be examined urgently.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters should be examined. For instance, different problems are experienced in rural areas in comparison to those experienced in Dublin, Galway or Limerick. I become upset when I visit isolated areas because the only way to inject life into a small rural parish is to attract people to live there. Once the population of an area falls below a certain level the community becomes untenable because it cannot pay for its services. I am aware of cases where planners have refused permission to people to build a road to their house or use red brick even though there might not be a house for half a mile. If a couple decides to borrow £100,000 and use red brick I do not know who they are upsetting and I cannot understand why permission is refused. It is exceedingly difficult to understand that that is the law. I can understand a refusal if somebody wishes to build a huge house beside a bungalow, for example.</P>
    <P>Rural resettlement is another issue. Jim Connolly does a great job assisting people who want to move from urban centres, such as Dublin, to isolated rural areas. He experiences phenomenal problems with the planning system for a variety of reasons and some streamlining should be con<Col N="1451" /> sidered for these applications. It is a cardinal rule that the inheritor of a farm should be allowed to build a house on the farm where it is most suitable. It is important that all the loose ends are tied up in this legislation and I hope it will operate in the manner that the Minister intends, but some principles that he espouses in it will not achieve his targets. He must do more.</P>

      <P>This Bill will be seen in the future as one of the most important Bills dealt with by this Dáil. It has major long-term implications for the future of the country and will have a direct impact on the shape of the society, environment and the economy in which we will live for decades to come. Its avowed purpose is to revise, extend and consolidate existing planning legislation and to provide for proper planning and sustainable development of all areas. Reform of existing legislation is, undoubtedly, very necessary. Even more necessary is a progressive vision for the planned development of our country and the translation of that vision into sound policies and effective and enforceable legislation.</P>
      <P>In the 1970s and 1980s the built fabric of our cities and some of our towns was torn asunder, removing forever not only irreplaceable aspects of our heritage but the potential to develop in a more harmonious and sustainable way. At the same time, unbridled urban sprawl ate up the rural hinterlands of large towns and cities. Damaging development has been facilitated by the always cosy and often corrupt relationship between developers and some of those within the dominant political parties in this State, to which they have been such generous contributors. North county Dublin is only the most notorious example of how this relationship has worked. That in some way is the bigger picture with which people are familiar but they must also be familiar with the smaller one.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has had a close up view, as I have had for the past 15 years, can testify to the persistence of the nod and wink, backstairs culture which allows favoured friends of some of those in high office and some of those with elected power in local authorities to undermine, evade and, sometimes, even openly flout the planning laws. The hidden hand of patronage has worked behind the scenes and this still goes on. It will require not only vigorous enforcement of this Bill when enacted but a change in the dominant party political culture in this State for it to be truly eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill maintains the current concept of planning as a means whereby the State and local authorities act principally to curb the excesses of market driven development instead of being proactive planners. Such a proactive approach would entail integrated planning <Col N="1452" /> which takes into account where people live, work and are educated, how they travel to and from work and school and their need for recreational outlets and the freedom to enjoy both our urban and rural environment.</P>
      <P>The kind of thinking that perceives objectors as nuisances and causes of delay has crept into the legislation but democratic participation should be encouraged. A development, once approved and constructed, can last a lifetime or several lifetimes with irreversible consequences. Compared to that, the time taken to process current planning procedures is relatively brief.</P>
      <P>As a result of flawed thinking, the Bill contains three measures which will restrict democratic participation in the planning process, rather than enhance it. These measure are the imposition of a fee to make a submission on a planning application, the requirement to make a submission at the initial planning stage in order to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and the further new condition whereby a person will have to prove what is termed &ldquo;a substantial interest&rdquo; in the matter in order to seek judicial review of a planning decision. I strongly oppose all of these measures.</P>
      <P>The fee will achieve nothing except to act as a deterrent to people participating in the planning process. We have no guarantee that it would remain at the level of approximately £20, which the Minister suggests. I have spoken to people involved in planning in local authorities and they believe this fee will slow the planning process as it will add further administrative costs and bureaucracy to an already overburdened system. The same planners have told me that submissions from local people on planning applications highlight issues of which the planning authority may not be aware and that the task of dealing with objections or submissions is not considered onerous.</P>
      <P>The requirement on people to have made a previous submission in order to appeal to An Bord Pleanála is a very bad provision. It is very often the case that concerned individuals or groups do not become aware of proposed developments until after permission has been granted. These are to be excluded from the process and denied their rights as a result of this provision. The third impediment to public participation in the planning process is the restriction of the right to seek judicial review to those with &ldquo;a substantial interest&rdquo;. The restriction would apply to those who are determined not to have &ldquo;a substantial interest&rdquo; by the measure of this legislation. This has the potential to bar access to the courts, which may well interpret &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; as property and/or commercial interest and, thus, penalise those who take a case on purely environmental grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such measures are supposedly included to streamline the planning process but restricting public access to it is not the way to make the planning system more efficient and less subject to unnecessary delays. What is needed is increased resourcing of local authorities with the employ<Col N="1453" /> ment of more expert and qualified staff. The Bill, when enacted, will make that need more acute. Local authorities will be required to be more vigilant and proactive in enforcing planning regulations and ensuring breaches of them are punished. The reality is that local authorities currently do not have the resources to provide efficient and effective enforcement. Unless they are provided with those resources, the enforcement provisions in the Bill, which I welcome, will remain a dead letter.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the Government's flawed approach to social and economic planning more obvious than in the housing section of the Bill. This is by far the most loudly trumpeted and the best known section. The Minister asks us to place great faith in the capacity of these measures to solve the housing crisis. In the absence of a comprehensive strategy and radical action to address the housing crisis the Government has advanced Part V as the great panacea. It is included in the Bill as a belated response to the biggest social problem facing tens of thousands of people in this State.</P>
    <P>Part V includes detailed and complex measures supposedly designed to make land available for what is called social and affordable housing. In fact, the Bill represents a move away from the idea of social housing in its broadest sense. This is a definite move away from the idea that the State and local authorities are directly responsible for housing those who cannot afford to provide it for themselves. Under the Bill, local authorities are required to draft housing strategies for their areas but the Government lacks any clear or coherent housing strategy.</P>
    <P>To present Part V of the Bill as the solution to the housing crisis is to attempt to delude over 40,000 households representing about 100,000 people on our current local authority waiting lists. These people cannot and will not be deluded by the measures in the Bill which do nothing to address or redress the current housing crisis. These people demand their right to housing and it is our responsibility to provide it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the contribution of the last speaker extraordinary because not one constructive proposal was laid before the House on how we should address the problem. I accept his central argument that the availability of housing is a basic right which we would wish to have available to all our citizens, and that the right to purchase a house at a reasonable price is one which we must try to protect and advance through our deliberations in this Chamber. The economic reality, however, is that the number of dwellings completed this year was 46,000, the largest number ever in a calendar year since the foundation of the State. In 1993 there were 21,500 new dwellings completed in the State. In 1997, the figure rose to 40,000. It has now risen to 46,000, so there has been a consistent increase in the number of dwellings constructed in the State for occupational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> Despite that consistent increase, however, there has been an alarming and even more dramatic increase in the cost of housing and that has taken place because demand outstrips supply. That is why the problem has arisen, and it is very easy to take refuge in the kind of rhetoric in which Deputy Ó Caoláin has just indulged. He suggests we are making a mistake in this legislation in restricting somewhat the rights of objection when we know that the answer to problems of supply and demand is that we need more land for housing. Unless we supply more land for housing we will not be able to build houses on it. That may be a rather obvious point, but how often do I pick up the newspaper and read about fringe political interests, such as the Deputy's, objecting to new developments? The culture of objection has become strongly rooted in this country and is part of the reason for spiralling house prices. It is not the only reason, however. I accept there are other factors but we must devise practical measures in this House to address the problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this measure because it is a consolidation measure and a fundamental review of the entire planning code as we face into the new century. The Minister, on his appointment, initiated a fundamental study based on essential principles of what the planning system required in the years ahead. This Bill is the fruit of that study. The Bill can be subject to detailed scrutiny and criticism &ndash; I have criticisms of the measure &ndash; but it is a welcome measure in that it tries to put what we should be doing into statutory focus. I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to overall strategy, I welcome the fact that in addition to the development plan local area plans and regional planning guidelines will be put on a statutory basis. Putting the entire matrix of the planning system on a statutory basis is a long overdue step.</P>
    <P>What we are facing in the planning system &ndash; let us not be under any illusions about it &ndash; is an enormous pace of change which has been generated by the economic boom of recent years. We are looking at an enormous pace of new development. I accept that it has put extraordinary strains on the planning system, and two factors in particular which are not dealt with sufficiently in the Bill are public transport and education. The volume of new housing growth is now so substantial that great strain is being put on the capacity of our basic public transportation networks and our education system to deliver the services that have to be provided with such housing development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the regional planning guidelines and the area plans will now be built into the legislation because that puts a clearer focus on those wider infrastructural needs that accompany the extensive development we are seeing, particularly in the suburban areas of the larger cities. We have all had the experience of reading development plans and noting that they <Col N="1455" /> often contain a wish list of objectives or desiderata which local planners and elected members would like to see in an area rather than a focused approach which links new development to the availability of these essential infrastructural provisions.</P>
    <P>I would like to focus on education in particular because one of the decisions the Government has taken in the sphere of education &ndash; a very good decision and I commend the Minister for introducing it &ndash; was to increase substantially the amount of capital funding available for the acquisition of sites and for the construction of buildings for primary schools. The old requirement that the patron had to stump up a substantial amount of the moneys under both of those headings was dispensed with. The Minister now acquires the sites and pays up to 90% of the building costs. That has had a significant knock-on effect in this particular area of land use control because, up to now, the sites were obtained on a relatively cheap basis. Until now, the builder was induced or persuaded to part with the site for little or no consideration to the relevant patron setting up the local school but a pattern is beginning to emerge where the owner of the land is demanding a very substantial payment for the provision of a school site. That is something the taxpayer should not be required to stand over, yet this practice is developing because the Department has made the funding available for the construction of the school and the acquisition of the site.</P>
    <P>In planning legislation it has always been axiomatic that one cannot condition a person, through a planning permission, to require a transfer of some land for a social purpose. A condition cannot be inserted in a planning permission requiring someone to provide a site for an educational purpose. Equally, while the section 38 agreements, which traditionally have regulated the more substantial type of development, can provide for open spaces &ndash; that seems to be envisaged in the legislation and the practice &ndash; one cannot provide for a school site. The zoning can state education as a general objective but it does not appear to be a distinct land use category within established zoning practice. The current practice is that the Department of Education and Science advises the relevant local authority to reserve a site. However, that site may be reserved on lands which are reserved for residential use and so the owner of the lands may require of the Department the compensation or payment appropriate to residential development in respect of that site. That is the situation which exists under current legislation and practice and it is not being changed under this legislation. It is an issue at which I urge the Minister to look again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about realistic planning into the future, we should be looking at proper planning for education and we should not require of the taxpayer payments of money or compen<Col N="1456" /> sation for the acquisition of sites for school purposes. If we are now looking at developments where one has up to 1,000, 2,000 or even more houses built as part of one development by a developer, it seems quite reasonable that it should be possible, under the planning legislation, for the local authority to insist that the provision of a site for a school is something for which the taxpayer should not be obliged to pay. That is a matter at which we should look again in the context of this Bill. The key infrastructural gaps now opening in education and public transport have to be addressed. Local authorities, as planning authorities, have not traditionally had a function in this area. We need to tighten up the legislation to ensure that is addressed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned education because it is an issue about which I feel strongly. I urge the Minister to look again at the measure on Committee Stage to see whether he can address it. I do not believe the Estimates on which this House votes in regard to the provision of education should be applied to the acquisition of sites or the remuneration of property owners. While it is very clear in the case of a primary school where a site should be in the order of three to five acres, when one moves to a secondary school it becomes more debatable because we are talking about eight acres. It certainly should not apply to the acquisition of lands for a hospital or a third level college where a substantial acreage would be required.</P>
    <P>In relation to general housing policy, I come back to the point I raised with Deputy Ó Caoláin earlier. This is a matter of supply and demand. There has been a huge increase in demand and we have to judge the Bill on the basis of whether it will increase supply. Requiring builders to provide for a certain amount of land for social housing, for affordable housing or a combination of both in the format envisaged by the legislation may have a certain effect on the supply of land for building purposes. There is no point pretending otherwise or living in a world of illusion.</P>
    <P>On balance, the Minister has made the right judgment on this but it reinforces the point that we have to provide for serviced land and, as Deputy Dukes pointed out at the beginning of this debate and Deputy Ó Caoláin said, give the local authorities and administrations the staff they require to address the problems. I can report from Fingal County Council &ndash; I am not a member of the authority but have many dealings with it &ndash; that it has considerable staff problems because it has to cope with this huge volume of new housing development.</P>
    <P>There are alarming signs in Dublin that there is not very much land left. Already the local authorities in several areas are finding it exceptionally difficult to find any land for social housing. When we are talking about the social housing scheme envisaged in this Bill, we are talking about a scheme which is going to be implemented at a future date.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, there were developments in the 1970s and 1980s when attempts were made <Col N="1457" /> to form parishes which were mixed &ndash; mixed in the sense that there was a mix between local authority and private housing. The formula of a 50:50 balance was used in three parishes, in particular, where this experiment was carried out. It was found that the experiment did not work and that on issues such as school choice and social mixing, a separation took place within the parish. My view is &ndash; the Minister has made the right call on this in the legislation &ndash; that if one wants to develop that type of desirable social mix, one has to realise that the local authority proportion cannot be increased very far beyond the 20% figure. If one moves beyond that figure, the social mix does not work and one gets a social separation. In fact, one reinforces in close proximity the very social tensions and problems one is trying to reduce and eliminate.</P>
    <P>Given the shortage of land in the Dublin local authorities &ndash; in Dún Laoghaire and city areas &ndash; for social housing, these authorities will have to construct developments outside their own functional areas to meet housing needs. That is inevitable given present trends. Again, we had direct experience of how that particular pattern worked and it was not a happy development. Carrying out developments in another functional area where another functional area provides certain services while the basic housing requirement is met from the distant local housing authority is a difficult approach, yet it will have to be attempted in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There has been an extraordinary increase in demand &ndash; an alarming position in this city &ndash; and an alarming rise in house prices. The Minister's response in this measure is an attempt to address part of the problem &ndash; to plan in the longer term for development, which will contain a desirable social mix, and to attempt to put a brake on the housing market. I do not believe we should delude ourselves into thinking that this Bill will solve the basic problem which has been caused by our economic growth which is that demand for new housing is far outstripping supply. Yet for us to respond to that would require the production of houses on such a scale as to put severe pressure on and create a threat to our infrastructure. That is the reality in the greater Dublin area and the Minister has attempted to address that through this legislation.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation disposed of huge amounts of its land bank in County Dublin in recent years. However, we now have to introduce a measure to provide that we exact from owners of land, land for social housing. An extraordinary catalogue of mistakes have been made in this area. The corporation had substantial land banks on the periphery of this city which have been lost in recent years. That clearly was a mistake and we are paying the price for that administrative mistake.</P>
    <P>When the Kenny committee looked at this problem many years ago, it was realised that the possession of a large land bank by a local authority is the only way to guarantee to keep down land prices. If the local authority has a large land <Col N="1458" /> bank, the land can be sold to smaller developers at an economic cost and housing can then be built on it. The present position where a few landowners have a large amount of land around this city is plainly undesirable but it is unavoidable if local authorities insist on divesting themselves of all their land bank and leaving it to the market to acquire land for building purposes.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the constitutionality of these measures. I did not find much reference to it in the debate. As a Member of this House, I am allowed to say that I do not believe it would be desirable for the President to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court because it is a very detailed Bill running to a very large number of sections. Were the President to refer a Bill of this type to the Supreme Court &ndash; it is not a money Bill so it would be open to the President to do so &ndash; one would again have consideration of a large number of sections. Even taking the sections in the social housing Part, there would be consideration of a large number of sections in the abstract without any real experience of how they have been tested in their concrete application. That would be a very undesirable reference &ndash; although it is a power the President has and I do not want to take from that &ndash; because it would mean that the Bill would be adjudicated before we saw how its provisions worked out.</P>
    <P>A person affected adversely by the provisions of this measure always has the remedy of proceedings in the courts to invalidate the measure if the injustice is so fundamental that it infringes the Constitution. There is no proven injustice in the measure or proven infringement of private property rights which would justify a reference at this stage. The Government has taken advice on the matter and clearly the advice was that the measure was in accordance with the Constitution. If the matter was referred, it would lead to an undesirable state of affairs in that we will not have seen the housing strategy provision implemented. When that is implemented and the Bill is in operation, it will be much easier to identify concrete measures of injustice, if such exist, as result of the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are concerns about the introduction of charges for representations to local authorities on planning matters. The planning code is a public code of which a citizen is entitled to avail. It is undesirable that citizens' rights should be cluttered up by these kinds of charges. I would not like them to be introduced simply as a revenue gathering measure or device. That is not a desirable consideration in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>The power of the board to award costs against a vexatious appellant should be examined as should the question as to whether An Bord Pleanála should have more power in awarding costs against parties who appeal to the board. If the powers of the board to award costs against a party whom it believed lodged an appeal without any real merit were to be extended, that might operate as a powerful deterrent in relation to vexatious appeals. I do not like the idea of charges <Col N="1459" /> being brought in simply to collect a few more shillings for a particular local authority. It is not the way to administer a matter where rights have been conferred on the citizen. There have always been criticisms of stamp duties on certain types of court documents and proceedings. When people are invoking the Constitution and legal rights, they should not be subjected to charges in connection with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the Minister, but of all politicians here over many years, since the foundation of the State. The criticism is aimed primarily at our failure to provide resources so that we can have a co-ordinated series of planning developments here. I am talking, particularly of the Department of the Environment, as it was known for about 20 years up to recently when it became known as the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as the Department with responsibility for building houses, providing water and sewerage and maintaining secondary roads. There is not any co-ordinated and balanced development taking place here. If one were to go to any city in Europe, Britain or even across the Border into Northern Ireland, one would see that balance.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for the past 33 years and I continuously have arguments with my fellow councillors and officials of the local authority of which I am a member, about the manner in which we build in a centre of a town or a city solidly outwards, thereby creating concrete jungles. When I ask where are the green spaces, amenities, gardens and playing pitches which should be developed and maintained by the local authority, I am told the farmland is our green space. That is a nil answer. We have failed miserly in here where the power lies, to do what needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this is the most fundamental reform of planning in Ireland since the enactment of the 1963 Planning Act. &ldquo;Fundamental&rdquo; is a weak word. What we need is radical reform. The best planning that was done here was probably done by the British when they occupied the country, particularly in the 18th century and the 19th century in terms of all the fine estates in the middle class areas of Dublin. When we got control of our own destiny in the 20th century, we destroyed our environment. The higgledy-piggledy form of planning in many of our towns and villages is appalling. A three storey building may adjoin a one storey building, be it a shop or a residence. Our planning is all over the place. It is no wonder that recently Dublin was deemed to be one of the least attractive capital cities in Europe. We have not learned from our mistakes. We have put up gaudy office blocks next to magnificent period buildings. We continually do that. There is no co-ordination of planning and no town planning here. We do not seem to have or to know anything about town planning. Is there such a person as a town and country planner in <Col N="1460" /> this State? Are there green belts on the outskirts of our towns and cities? The answer is obvious. There are not, and there are not any proposals to provide them. I am disgusted that none of us over the years has taken the initiative to do something radical.</P>
    <P>A fundamental flaw in our planning laws is our refusal to provide moneys for balanced development, in other words, to provide, lay out and maintain open spaces and amenities in conjunction with the building of houses. In any city or town in Europe, Britain or Northern Ireland, one will see lovely mixed housing developments, including playgrounds for children, bowling greens for older citizens and picnic areas for everybody, but one will not see that here. These should all be provided together with adequate road networks, be they accompanied by flyovers or tunnels, and a proper transport system. I congratulate the Government on pressing ahead with the tunnel planned for the docks, which will remove many of the juggernauts and heavy traffic that are causing problems along the quays and the main thoroughfares of this and other cities in the country. There is a tunnel in Cork and one is planned for Dublin. The sooner it is in place, the better. Also, the sooner the Luas system is up and running, the better, as it will alleviate many of the traffic problems. All these facilities must be taken into account in conjunction with planning.</P>
    <P>Dublin city does not rate when it comes to a properly planned, laid out city. The architecture in the business areas, by and large, is dire. The areas of Georgian design are very attractive, but overall the level of planning and the aesthetic values are very low. Ironically the Georgian buildings and the other attractively designed buildings date from the time of British occupation. A recent survey of European capitals rated Dublin very lowly. Our social life may well be the best in Europe or in the world, but we do not feature when it comes to planning. Irish towns in general are affected by a similar malaise, they suffer very much from unco-ordinated planning.</P>
    <P>Likewise the planning of most local authority houses and estates up to the past 15 or 20 years was substandard. There has been a vast improvement in recent years with local authority housing competing with private development when it comes to quality of design and excellence of construction. The lack of an overall planning strategy leaves a great deal to be desired. We badly need town planners. Over the years I have claimed that for every pound spent on constructing houses, we should spend a matching pound on the provision of properly laid out open spaces, such as playing fields, gardens, swimming pools and parks, managed and maintained by the local authority. Recreational facilities and amenities should be available to all, young and old. We have a very insular short-sighted series of policies. Our quality of life is suffering immensely as a result, with young people in particular turning to drink, drugs, joyriding and vandalism instead of good healthy pur<Col N="1461" /> suits. In a climate such as ours &ndash; and I am referring to the weather &ndash; it is vital to provide adequate indoor facilities rather than having young people hanging around pubs, pool halls and the streets. It leads to all sorts of social ills and an undesirable lifestyle. Is it any wonder that we have the highest incidence of cardiac disease in Europe and probably in the world?</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should be advising and assisting local authorities when it comes to contentious issues such as dumps, landfills and telecommunication masts. They should be promoting the positive aspects of wind farms. Unfortunately, the officials of local authorities, and in particular the elected members, are left to their own designs which puts them under all sorts of unreasonable demands by pressure groups which in many cases are uninformed of the consequences of the proposed developments. They do not realise that most of these developments are quite harmless &ndash; in particular the erection of masts to assist in telecommunications. It has been clearly illustrated that the radiation from those masts is not dangerous; nevertheless, whenever a mast goes up one has this problem. Similarly, pressure groups say they do not want wind farms in their area. Wind farms are very desirable because they obviate the need to burn fossil fuels which produce gases that deplete the ozone layer.</P>
    <P>We suffer from a series of difficulties by not properly advising or financing local authorities. Such authorities should receive finance not just to provide land for housing but also for open spaces. Legislation should be introduced to ensure that the price paid for land provided for open spaces should be at an agricultural rate rather than the development rate. The fact that all such land is purchased at the development rate is inhibiting the provision of open spaces and amenity areas. If we had a mixture so that land for housing would fetch a development price while land for amenities would sell for an agricultural price, we could have the type of balanced development I am advocating.</P>
    <P>The problem of litter impinges on the environment in a big way. I was glad to see Mr. Bill Power, the outgoing president of the Irish Hotels Federation, making a strong statement some weeks ago about the damage litter louts are doing to the tourism industry. People are throwing litter out of car windows and they throw chip bags around the streets at night, while others throw bags of rubbish over fences and down laneways. That is a blight on the nation as a whole. Maybe it is brought about by affluence and lack of education but I do not know what the solution is. There is no easy answer, but one will have to be found.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's proposals for the protection of trees. However, the manner in which we have allowed people to destroy trees and wildlife habitats in general has been a serious omission. We have been very backward in providing a proper environment. When I see magnificent rows of beech and other deciduous trees being felled <Col N="1462" /> without good reason I get very annoyed. Rather than looking after the beautiful environment with which we were endowed, we are actually destroying it. We are busily constructing concrete jungles but we should make it our business to provide for a co-ordinated and balanced type of development where people can live better and more fulfilling lives. That is not happening at the moment. The Bill will not help us to do so because it does not cover the type of radical reform of planning laws which is needed. The planning laws are outdated and they are not being updated. We compare very poorly with other countries in the civilised world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been a long time coming and, no doubt, by the time it has passed through the House anomalies will be found in it, as is the case with most legislation. It is probably the most comprehensive planning legislation to have come before the House since the 1963 Act. Looking at the overall situation regarding planning and development, many of us could sympathise with much of what Deputy Deasy said. Sometimes one wonders whether we have planning laws at all. Do we really think before granting planning permission? Do local authorities look constructively at planning applications that come before them? As members of local authorities, we have all made representations over the years concerning planning applications. In many cases we have had to try to resolve problems in the course of such applications, whether for individual homes or for commercial development.</P>
      <P>In considering the planning laws and the problems that come with them, we must take a much broader view. We cannot look at the issue in the context of where a proposed development may be in the scheme of things; we must look further. In some cases we may even have to look ten, 15 or 20 years down the road to see what will happen with regard to other infrastructure. Is a proposed development likely to threaten future road or other developments needed to improve our infrastructure?</P>
      <P>We must also examine the position with regard to water, sewerage and roads. In many cases if a development is not done properly the advantage can be lost. We can end up with watercourses being polluted or with major loss of water supply. Sewerage schemes are very desirable where there is any reasonable density of housing construction or commercial developments. However, in some cases we end up with the syndrome of the continual septic tanks every 200 yards, which is not in the interests either of the occupiers or of an area's total development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we often criticise local authorities for seeking treatment units, even for single houses, they are probably the most positive things that can be sought because one is helping an individual. In many cases, especially in my part of the country, it has been found that after eight or ten years many of the septic systems do not work. That can lead to major problems for occupants of <Col N="1463" /> houses. Planners are often seen to be cruel by those who are trying to provide houses for the first time, but they are often doing such people a long-term favour. It is something that people often come to accept later.</P>
    <P>In many cases, our roads infrastructure on the outskirts of towns is not sufficient to cater for new developments. The position is the same in regard to roads into and out of Dublin. The infrastructure put in place ten or 15 years ago is no longer sufficient to carry the volume of traffic using those roads on a daily basis. If one goes into Dublin at certain times of the day a short journey can take from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. That is in nobody's interest. It is not just those trying to do their business who are affected, but the environment is also affected by the heavy traffic. We might not feel that impact on an individual basis, but traffic pollution must be considered. I hope the proposed Dublin light rail and port tunnel developments will proceed as soon as possible in order to take some of the traffic out of Dublin city centre. Once that is done, people will see the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of infrastructure in many of the building developments that have been completed over the years. There are problems in big housing estates all over the country because there are no facilities such as green areas and there are no schools or community facilities in many instances. The provision of proper infrastructure will have to become part of any major development in future. I am not talking about water, sewerage and roads, I refer to schools, shopping and community facilities. These amenities will have to be provided if we are to have integrated communities. Some of the money often seen to be spent on developments would be much better spent on back-up facilities for those developments. The provision of school and community facilities should be compulsory for any development of 400 to 5,000 houses or more. We must be realistic. It is terrible to see young families move into a new housing estate only to discover that their children must travel four or five miles to get to a primary school, or ten miles to a secondary school. That is not in the interests of development of communities. Shopping facilities are also a problem in some areas and we hope to see planners take a positive view when it comes to providing facilities in major developments.</P>
    <P>Density has become a problem in many developments and this Bill proposes increasing the allowable density. I have reservations in this regard, perhaps because I come from a county which does not have many density problems. If high density housing and low rise buildings are provided, is that the most efficient use of the land available in an area such as Dublin? I understand that low rise buildings and housing are more important for young families, but if some of the high rise buildings had proper facilities such as lifts they would serve people well, particularly <Col N="1464" /> older people. Density will be a major planning problem in future.</P>
    <P>We are told that ribbon developments are not desirable in rural areas. That may be so, but in many cases they give people the opportunity to buy their first home or to get off local authority housing lists. A sympathetic view should be taken of people seeking planning permission for single houses in rural areas. Perhaps group applications could be allowed and group facilities could be put in place for water, sewerage and other necessary infrastructural provisions. Older buildings are often knocked down and replaced and we should be more positive about refurbishment. If there is a need to give incentives for refurbishment in some urban areas, that would be preferable to some of the developments we see at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a local authority to take over a certain area of a site proposed for development. That provision has pros and cons. In some cases that will not be of great benefit to the local authority as it may not be able to afford the land it seeks to acquire or, in acquiring it, the authority may not be able to develop the land as speedily as those who have bought houses in the estate would like. It will not always be the best solution. Would it be easier if builders provided a certain number of houses on a site for the local authority at a realistic price? If one has to do double the work in providing facilities for all the sites, one might find that the benefit which would accrue to the local authority in getting the site would be lost in its development. We must also look at the amount of time local authorities have to develop these sites. That time should be limited.</P>
    <P>Completion of sites is another bone of contention. Builders in many cases are known to have walked off sites, leaving lights, footpaths and other facilities incomplete. A comprehensive bonding system is needed to deal with this and those found in default should not be granted further permissions. The percentage who are at fault is very small, but it gives those who do a good job a bad name which may be unwarranted.</P>
    <P>Some people object to developments irrespective of whether they are affected. In some cases people who object to developments live five or ten miles away, which is wrong. It is worse than the NIMBY attitude, because if someone objects to planning permission for a development next to him or her, one can understand they may have genuine fears, but one often finds people objecting to developments, particularly commercial developments, five or ten miles away, even though these may be attempts to create employment. For their own reasons, some people object without thinking of the costs involving loss of time for the developers. There should be tighter controls for lodging third party appeals to An Bord Pleanála. The Bill will help to speed up the system, but should there be two levels of fees for lodging appeals? If someone has a genuine appeal, they should be charged a nominal fee. However, if someone lodges a spurious or malicious appeal, I agree with Deputy Lenihan <Col N="1465" /> that there should be a provision allowing the board to award costs against them. It is terrible to think someone may be held up for six or 12 months in a case where the applicants know their appeal is doomed from the beginning. This is the case also in oral hearings. In some cases oral hearings are sought where there is no need for them and where the cases could have been dealt with more easily and more cheaply through the ordinary An Bord Pleanála mechanism.</P>
    <P>We would all like proper development plans by local authorities. Some local authorities split townlands on the outskirts of towns. It does not make sense that one side of a road, which may have the same facilities as the other side, may not be suitable for housing or commercial activities because of a development plan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal that afforestation will now be subject to the planning process. This is long overdue and will help to solve some of the problems relating to afforestation. The damage which can be caused to the environment by afforestation is worrying. In parts of the country water-courses have lost all fish life as a result of acids from indiscriminate planting and where coniferous needles have found their way into the water-courses. People might say this does not happen, but there is proof that it is happening. In the west of Ireland many rivers have been affected by indiscriminate planting. The regulations should make it quite clear that where planting is taking place there should be proper consideration of water-courses and the general environment. It is terrible to think that one can be surrounded by afforestation against ones will. There should be provision whereby people who seek to acquire land proposed for afforestation in order to preserve the amenity value of their property can do so. This is important and should be considered.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the provision of proper facilities in developing areas. This cannot be stressed forcefully enough, particularly when one considers the cities and large urban areas, where facilities were not provided and this led to social problems at a later stage. There needs to be more tightening up of the whole planning system. It is ridiculous that a local authority can write to someone seeking further information two days before a decision is due on the planning application. If a planning application is lodged and there is a 14 day waiting period, it should be mandatory for a local authority to seek any further information required within 21 days. It is unacceptable, if one is waiting for a planning decision that within two or three days of the deadline for the decision, further information is requested. This happens continually. Is the reason for this, insufficient staffing or insufficient engineers in planning offices or is it due to carelessness where there is not proper assessment of applications when they are lodged? It should be mandatory that further information is sought within 21 days of an application being lodged. I hope the Minister will try to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Another great ploy recently is that SACs are used as a means of refusing planning applications. This is something Dúchas does not want, and in some cases local authorities do not approach Dúchas to ascertain the position. As members of local authorities and of this House, we all had to deal with the issue of declaration of interests. That is not a problem. However, those involved in the administrative end should be forced to make full declarations of their interests. This might lead to a more transparent planning system and prevent people from making totally unfounded accusations against planners and staff of local authorities. We have all heard statements about favouritism, therefore the need for transparency in planning is important. There is also a need for more planners in local authorities because at present there appears to be a shortage of qualified planners to deal with planning applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has an unprecedented opportunity to put in place planning legislation which will improve significantly the current framework if he listens to and takes on board the distilled wisdom of Members of this House who have 20 and 30 years experience in local authorities. There are Members with legal, technical, engineering, administrative and architectural backgrounds. If the Minister of State had a genuinely open mind on this Bill, that distilled wisdom would result in a truly excellent framework for planning and development into the new century. However, the attitude of &ldquo;I know best&rdquo; is by and large what we have heard from the Minister to date. To discard the wisdom and views from all sides of the House that are contrary or additional to what is in the Bill will serve neither the Minister, the Government nor the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V deals with housing supply, housing strategies, development plans, affordable housing, social housing and so on. It is an unquestionable fact that in the north Cork housing division of Cork County Council fewer houses are being built today than were built during the worst recession in the mid-1980s, despite the Celtic tiger economy and all that orgy of self-congratulations about the Irish economy. That is an undisputed fact at a time when significantly more people are on local authority housing lists. The Minister's figleaf proposal to smash and grab 20% of development land to placate the growing numbers on waiting lists is so transparently inoperable that it defies logic for the Minister to be hell bent on proceeding with it. This will mean the remaining 80% of houses will be more expensive and more and more people will not be able to afford their own houses. These people will tumble on to the already out of control local authority waiting lists. It is estimated that there are approximately 40,000 people nationwide on local authority housing lists. That figure, multiplied by three, which reflects the average family size, brings the number on local authority waiting lists to 120,000 <Col N="1467" /> people. That is approximately the equivalent of the population of Cork city on local authority housing lists and living in various types of inadequate accommodation such as high rent accommodation, overcrowded accommodation, unfit accommodation and homeless. This is happening at a time of unprecedented financial wherewithal.</P>
    <P>We are building fewer houses in certain local authority areas than we were in the mid-1980s and the proposal from the Minister is simply inoperable. This problem has manifested itself all over my constituency. Parents attempt to help out where they have financial means and assist people to get on the first rung of the ladder. They buy their own site or try to build their own house. In many instances, a mobile home is placed in the back garden and the son or daughter with spouse and child live there because it is quite simply beyond their means to provide accommodation for themselves. That is a sad indictment of society as we congratulate ourselves on record numbers of people at work, interest rates at favourable levels and, despite inflation beginning to raise its ugly head again, by and large a successful economy. More and more people are being pushed to the margins because they cannot afford the basics, the most fundamental of which is accommodation.</P>
    <P>This provision, if the Minister proceeds with it, will mean that we will be snarled up in court challenges and in administrative bureaucracy at individual local authority levels, where there are protracted negotiations about the value of the 20%, about which 20 acres of land it should be in, and whether it will be one area of four acres or another. It is inoperable. The wording of the Bill will not deliver the Minister's objective. There is no substitute, in terms of the housing crisis, for a massive financial injection of resources to each local authority so that members can decide how best to tackle the problems in their area, whether by way of serviced sites, buying houses on the side of the street or in private estates, or building small local authority estates and not repeating the mistakes of the past. It was reported in one of the papers today that a crowd gathered at some venue in Dublin where the building mistakes of the 1960s were being demolished. These proposals will be a monumental mistake in the first year of the millennium and I urge the Minister to think again.</P>
    <P>The section on An Bord Pleanála also interests me. Much has been said by Members about vexatious appeals. The other side is the issue of vexatious applications. Nothing in this Bill deals with that issue. I can give an instance, chapter and verse, in my own constituency where the local authority has, on three occasions, granted planning approval which has subsequently on all occasions been overturned by An Bord Pleanála. The local authority refuses to implement the decision of An Bord Pleanála because local authorities have discretion. That is absurd. If we write out on foot of planning decisions made by local <Col N="1468" /> authorities to either the applicant or the objector and say that if they are not satisfied with the decision of the local authority they have a right to appeal and if the outcome of the appeal is not worth the paper on which it is written because the local authority has discretion, it brings An Bord Pleanála into disrepute. We can discuss at length all the provisions in this Bill to speed up decision making in An Bord Pleanála, to give it additional resources to reduce the timeframe it has to deal with appeals. However, if there is discretion and the decision it makes is not implemented by the local authority, how can one justify the existence of An Bord Pleanála to either an applicant or an appellant?</P>
    <P>I know of an instance where that has happened repeatedly. If the Office of Public Works decided to give the two fingers to a decision of An Bord Pleanála and to carry on regardless, there would be a public outcry. If it is John Citizen, not a corporate body, without the sufficient finances to take the next step to the courts to vindicate his rights, we are prepared to ride roughshod over him. It is an outrage and that loophole should be closed. I ask the Minister to respond on that issue when replying and more particularly to consider which amendments are appropriate to the section dealing with An Bord Pleanála and enforcement by local authorities. The current position brings the entire process into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled at vexatious appeals to An Bord Pleanála. There are equally vexatious planning applications. In other jurisdictions these can be dismissed out of hand by local authorities but it is not dealt with in this Bill. I would like the Minister to tackle this.</P>
    <P>In 1999 there were nearly 7,000 planning applications to my local authority, Cork County Council, with which I am familiar. In comparison with 1985, when I entered the local authority, there is at least a 100% increase and probably more. Yet we are operating with by and large the same level of staff. Members from all sides of the House have referred to a repeated practice in many local authorities which is becoming more prevalent. Planning applications are submitted, and on the deadline for a decision, rather than granting a refusal or a permission, the local authority sends out a registered letter looking for additional information. The staffing complement are unable to handle the volume of applications. This is a way of obtaining breathing space. It is entirely unacceptable from the point of view of the applicant and the public at large but it is happening. It is an instrument which they use to give themselves more time to come to an informed decision. Undoubtedly the large volume of applications leads to mistakes and the pressure on staff is enormous.</P>
    <P>I attended a general purposes committee meeting of Cork County Council today where the final item on the agenda under other business was a tribute to one of its senior planning officers who was leaving to take up a position in the private sector and good luck to him &ndash; an excellent plan<Col N="1469" /> ner lost to the public service. We are losing the best, most capable and experienced planners to the demands of private developers because of the successful economy. We are not ensuring there is adequate replacement.</P>
    <P>The point was made by other speakers that many people involved in making decisions on planning applications are not properly qualified. Engineers are dealing with applications where there should be architects and properly trained town planners. The number of educational establishments turning out properly qualified planners needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues in Cork County Council have said that with the loss of experienced staff there is an influx of youthful enthusiasm and idealism in many of the new staff members. I welcome that because I would concur with many of the views expressed that planning has been abysmal, the signs of which are all over the country. Kerry County Council is an example of a planning authority that has not acquitted itself with distinction. The national primary road from Killarney to Tralee is littered with development which makes driving on it outrageously dangerous. Rather than in-depth development, there is continual development for four or five miles on the main road from Killarney to Tralee with numerous bed and breakfasts, bungalows and two and three storey dwellings. There is atrocious development. The position is similar in Galway and a number of other local authority areas but I can say, with some degree of pride, that Cork County Council does not have that problem. In the 15 years since I have been a member of the council, I have only ever seen one section 4 motion tabled and that was rejected. This is to the credit of the members and the planning department of the local authority.</P>
    <P>However, this mechanism needs to be tightened up because it does not serve proper planning and development. The Ring of Kerry has been virtually destroyed as a tourist attraction because of honky-tonk plastic signs and badly designed developments in poor taste. Commercial facilities selling báinín jumpers and pottery have been added onto filling stations. However, such activities are hopelessly located and badly planned and many of them are the result of section 4 motions. It is a pity because the area was the jewel in the crown of southern tourism and it is much poorer now because of the development that has taken place in haste over the past 20 years. It is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take account of the pressures under which local authorities operate. This is why registered letters are sent on the last day of the two months available to deal with planning applications. People with appropriate qualifications are beginning to be recruited and they are causing much difficulty in many local authority areas because of their proper approach. This sometimes causes considerable grievances but, in the long run, it will yield benefits because, as Deputy Deasy said, relative to our neighbours <Col N="1470" /> and the heritage we inherited from the British, we are making a poor job of planning.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with architectural heritage and listed buildings. Section 56 mentions the duties and obligations of owners and occupiers of listed properties. However, it is an outrage to demand that people who own such properties uphold and maintain them to an appropriate degree given the amount of financial incentives available to them. Many of these people have little financial means but they are obliged to spend enormous amounts of money on the buildings. The State makes very little money available for such purposes. A fund has been established by each local authority but that will only scratch the surface.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case where a man living in a listed building had the choice of walking away from it and building a new house but spent over £70,000 putting a new roof on it. Not a brown penny was made available to him for that work. The Bill will place an obligation on people to maintain such houses, but only a pittance will be made available to them. If we are serious about our architectural heritage and listed buildings, it must be matched with financial resources. The State is guilty because listed buildings all over the country, particularly courthouses, are falling down.</P>
    <P>District judges are creating a huge controversy about this matter, in addition to other matters about which they are creating controversy. The Bill will place an obligation on private owners and occupiers while the State does not fulfil its own obligations with regard to listed buildings and courthouses in its ownership. A Bill was passed by the Oireachtas under which the State took ownership of court offices from local authorities. However, it is not fulfilling its duties. In addition to putting financial resources into privately owned listed buildings, the State should put its own house in order.</P>
    <P>It is important to democratise the planning process as much as possible and to foster public participation in it. This is why I have an abhorrence of the proposal to limit a person's right of appeal. Some of the people who objected to the development in the Burren were from Dublin, Galway and other parts of the country and the decision was correct. Decision making by An Bord Pleanála should be speeded up to ensure decisions are available within two or three months. The main criticism is the delay and not the fact that appeals are being lodged by third parties.</P>
    <P>There should be participation by people in all aspects of public life and planning is an integral part of public life. It is essential. We bemoan the fact that only 40% of the electorate turn out in by-elections. However, this is symptomatic of a lack of public confidence in institutions. If it is made more difficult for it to access institutions, it will feed the climate of suspicion which currently exists. The charges and restrictions mooted for appeals of planning decisions are wrong in principle and I ask the Minister to reconsider them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation. The Minister has put down a challenge to all Members to debate at length the issues in the Bill and the impact it will have on society and on development in every county. However, until the Bill is matched with an outline of how local government will be financed and how the role of public representatives in that structure can be strengthened, local government will not function as it should.</P>
      <P>In spite of the increases introduced by the Government in the various sections of the Bill, local government is still not properly funded. There is a huge shortfall in terms of power and the system which operates under the county manager legislation. Local government is not working. In the past it functioned well, but we live in changing times. The public wants the people it elects to take positive steps, make real decisions and do the job for which they are elected, but that is not happening with regard to county development plans. Local authority members can sit around a table and argue about what they want to happen in their towns and counties. However, they no sooner have a development plan in place when an official or officials introduce conditions that can be attached to planning applications which almost nullify the input of the public representatives.</P>
      <P>At a time when the Government and its predecessors have been trying to retain the population in rural areas and farming is not doing well, many people on the land want to sell sites to keep the farm alive or to keep a family member on the farm. However, they cannot sell to invest in the land because there is a provision in most local authority areas that a family member must be the first occupier of the house in question. This defeats the purpose of what the land owner is trying to achieve for his or her land or family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is lengthy and complex and I cannot do justice to it in the short time available to me. It concerns every citizen in the State and I hope that when it is enacted it will enhance the quality of life for everyone who lives in our communities. The Bill consolidates the Acts from 1963 and updates the planning laws to provide a framework for future development of the island. I like most of what is contained in the Bill, which has 18 Parts and six Schedules. It is the most comprehensive legislation to come before the House. In <Col N="1472" /> welcoming it and highlighting certain aspects, one tends to be attracted to areas where one has reservations. That is human nature. However, as we deal with the various sections on Committee and Report Stages, we will be able to address other areas which we fully support.</P>
    <P>Part I outlines definitions and I am interested to note that under section 4 the planning of forests is no longer exempt. This was probably anticipated, but I note that felling and thinning are exempt and I wonder if that should be the case.</P>
    <P>Part V is most important. It recognises the importance of ensuring that an adequate amount of land is freed up to deal with housing needs. There is an explicit requirement for all future development plans to contain a housing strategy which should result in well thought out plans that provide sufficient and sustainable development. It is a tough task to meet the future housing and industrial needs of an economy that has expanded, and will continue to expand, as fast as ours. This Bill ensures that the mechanism to achieve this aim is enshrined in the planning process. Each plan will contain an estimate of the volume of housing required based on those eligible in that catchment area.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Blood Transfusion Service Board.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the situation where blood donors who were barred from giving blood in one clinic managed to donate blood in a different clinic because of a problem which arose when the Blood Transfusion Service Board was making its computer systems Y2K compliant and where, subsequently, one such donation was transferred into a patient. Has the Minister asked the BTSB for a full report on the situation? I raise this important issue because the Minister for Health and Children should immediately investigate how donors, who were temporarily barred from giving blood in one blood donor clinic, managed to donate some in another clinic. The blood of one of those barred donors was subsequently transfused into a patient in a clear breach of safeguards put in place by the BTSB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BTSB has had a difficult time in recent years in attempting to reassure doctors and the public that the country's blood supply is safe, following the infection of hundreds of Irish women and haemophiliacs with hepatitis C and HIV as a result of contaminated blood and blood products. The board must face more serious questions over the latest incident which occurred as a result of a problem when it was making its computer systems Y2K compliant. In the incident in question some donors were temporarily deferred from donating blood because <Col N="1473" /> of known risk factors. Will the Minister clearly state what were these known risk factors? It emerged they had attended other clinics and omitted to tell the officials at those clinics that they had been refused permission to donate for a certain period.</P>
    <P>One such donation of platelets was transferred into a patient. Tests carried out by the BTSB found the blood to be safe and there were no adverse consequences and all other units were recalled. The board may argue it was a once off occurrence and it cannot be blamed for the donors who knowingly acted in such a manner. However, in the minutes of the board meeting that I have seen, the board has described the incident as potentially serious because a layer of its security system was breached. The minutes of the board meeting held on 19 January at the boardroom of the headquarters at James's Street read: &ldquo;This problem had not come to light on earlier testing because a nil report had been generated during the test and had not been challenged further&rdquo;. This has subsequently been rectified.</P>
    <P>This issue highlights the need for a fall-back and adds weight to those who have advocated for months that the Cork BTSB centre should retain all the testing facilities it presently enjoys and should have the development carried out as demanded by the Irish Medicines Board in 1997. I ask the Minister to think long and hard before he makes his six appointments to the BTSB as there has been a centralised attitude to the delivery of the service by the board.</P>
    <P>A recent meeting held in Cork with the chief executive and the medical director of the Blood Transfusion Service Board did not in any way allay the fears of those concerned about the proposed downgrading of the Munster plant located in Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The incident referred to by Deputy Allen was caused by a problem which arose in December 1999 when work was being finalised on the Blood Transfusion Service Board's computer system to make it year 2000 compliant. As a result, the computer check which identified any donations received from donors who were temporarily deferred did not function properly. The problem concerned two donors who had been deferred due to recent nose piercing in one case, and recent acupuncture from a non-medically registered practitioner in the other. The board's own staff identified the malfunction which was rectified as soon as it was discovered. The BTSB also reported the incident to the Irish Medicines Board, which is the appropriate regulatory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Around 175,000 attendances to donate blood are recorded annually, either at fixed locations such as Pelican House in Dublin and St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork, or at one of almost 300 mobile clinics throughout the country. People who attend these clinics are sometimes temporarily deferred <Col N="1474" /> from giving blood for a number of reasons. Before any blood is taken, the donors are required to answer a very detailed questionnaire regarding their health. As a result, some will be advised that their blood cannot be accepted, usually because their haemoglobin levels may be low or they may be suffering from a cold or flu. People who have undergone procedures such as acupuncture &ndash; except when given by a registered medical practitioner &ndash; tattoos or body piercing are also deferred for a time because of a very small risk that hepatitis may be transmitted in this way. The deferral period may be up to a year depending on the reasons for deferral. In 1998, 13.21% of those who attended the BTSB's clinics were deferred, which is one of the highest rates of deferrals anywhere in the world and is indicative of the BTSB's stringent policies on vetting potential donors. When a person's donation is temporarily refused, he or she is informed, and the deferral is noted on the donor's computer record. If this person volunteers again during the deferral period, and gives the same information which led to the original deferral, then he or she will again be advised that their blood cannot be accepted until the deferral period has expired.</P>
    <P>If, for whatever reason, the individual forgets to mention relevant information on a subsequent visit, then the immediate identification of this fact will depend on whether the clinic attended is the same as the one previously visited. If the clinic is the same, then the computer system in the clinic will highlight immediately the fact that the donor is deferred and the donation will not be accepted. If the donor attends another of the almost 300 clinics nationwide, his or her existing computer records will not be immediately available and the donation will be accepted. In this instance, the computer records are downloaded into the main BTSB computer system at the end of the clinic session, and a computer generated report is run to identifiy any donors whose blood may have been taken during the deferral period. This &ldquo;deferred donor&rdquo; report is one of a number of reports reviewed by the board's medical staff prior to the release of a batch of donations.</P>
    <P>On 29 December 1999 it was observed that the suite of donor reports did not contain a report on donations made during the active deferral period, and further investigation showed that the problem was traced to work on the computer system to make it year 2000 compliant. The problem was rectified at once.</P>
    <P>Reports for December were then rerun and two donations were identified which had been taken from donors who were temporarily deferred. On investigation, the BTSB found that both of the deferred donors attended in December 1999 at a clinic which was different to one previously attended, completed the medical questionnaire and omitted to give the information which had previously led to their deferrals. Both donations had been subjected to rigorous laboratory checks and were found to be safe. Nevertheless, the recall procedure was <Col N="1475" /> initiated immediately and resulted in one donation being recalled and discarded before use. Red cells and plasma from the second donation were also recalled and discarded, however platelets had been infused into one patient.</P>
    <P>The donor whose platelets had been infused was traced in early January and agreed to undergo further tests by the BTSB, which were organised through her own general practitioner. Blood samples were obtained on 14 February and tested negative for all viral markers. The virus reference laboratory confirmed on 29 February that the sample tested negative for HIV 1 and 2, HIV antigen and HTLV 1 and 2. On 1 March 2000 confirmation was received from St. James's Hospital that the sample also tested negative for syphilis. On 3 March the virus reference laboratory indicated that the sample was also negative for hepatitis B and C.</P>
    <P>Any potential breach of security is recorded by the BTSB and in turn is inspected by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority. In this instance, the BTSB notified the Irish Medicines Board on 4 January of the problem with the deferred donors and the IMB requested a report on the incident and on corrective actions. The IMB notified my Department on 7 January and the Department also requested the BTSB to provide a report on the incident as soon as possible. On 11 January the medical director of the BTSB made his report to the Irish Medicines Board and supplied a copy to my Department. As soon as final testing was completed on the donor whose blood had been infused, the BTSB gave the Department details of the tests which had been completed and the results were all negative.</P>
    <P>The vital security check when processing blood is the sensitive laboratory testing which is carried out on all donations. This includes testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other viruses. A new processing step, leucodepletion, has also been introduced to remove over 99.5% of white cells from each donation, and Ireland has been in the forefront of countries which have introduced this procedure. In addition, a particularly sensitive test known as polymerese chain reaction, PCR, has been introduced to all donations. This test, which increases the ability to detect very low levels of hepatitis C in blood donations, is currently being undertaken for the BTSB by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.</P>
    <P>Both donations were subject to standard virology testing by the BTSB and passed. Recall of these donations was a standard procedure for any security breach, no matter how minor. The BTSB has assured my Department that both donations were safe to use. If the position had been otherwise the various testing procedures would have identified the problem and the blood would not have been released.</P>
    <P>My Department has made available approximately £4 million to replace the existing computer system which was the original cause of the problem. The new system &ndash; Progesa &ndash; is in use <Col N="1476" /> in many other transfusion centres internationally. Testing of the new software is currently under way, and implementation is scheduled to start in March and April, with a period of parallel running before the system goes live during the summer.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Asylum Seekers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The original decision to seek accommodation outside Dublin for asylum seekers was regarded by many as being motivated by a genuine desire to deal with the severe pressure on housing and other accommodation in Dublin arising from the very significant increase in the numbers seeking asylum here over the past two years. However, the way in which the decision is being implemented, combined with the penal rules regarding supplementary welfare entitlements for asylum seekers has created conditions of isolation, hardship and distress for many of those involved. It is suspected that the move is part of a wider plan to discourage asylum seekers from coming to this country in the first place.</P>
      <P>Seeking accommodation outside Dublin might be acceptable in principle if it were a totally voluntary arrangement. However, people are being sent compulsorily from Dublin, generally to hostels which are very often located in small towns remote from urban centres. People dispersed in this way suffer in two ways. They are deprived of the opportunity for intercultural liaison with others from their own countries or from same ethnic groups while they have little opportunity for real engagement with the local communities with which they have been placed. Given that many of the small towns to which they have been sent have very poor public transport facilities and asylum seekers do not have the resources to acquire their own transport, they are virtually incarcerated. They are cut off from legal advice and from the back-up services provided by organisations such as the Irish Refugee Council.</P>
      <P>Approximately 100 asylum seekers are located near the beautiful but remote village of Glengariff in County Cork. They are more than three miles from the village, with only one shop, very limited health facilities and no bus service. There is a security guard on their accommodation. This system could best be described as a form of benign internment.</P>
      <P>More than 800 asylum seekers have been relocated in this way and these include a small number of unaccompanied minors. Asylum seekers who are unaccompanied minors require particular care and attention. This will be acknowledged by the Minister of State with responsibility for the family. The Irish Refugee Council which has expressed concern about the inadequacy of services for minors has expressed particular alarm at the policy of dispersing unaccompanied minors in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mean and parsimonious approach to supplementary welfare payments has added to the difficulties of those relocated in this way. This has <Col N="1477" /> left 800 people isolated and virtually penniless. The system is regarded by the community welfare officers who are responsible for implementing it as so unfair and discriminatory that they have taken the unprecedented step of threatening to stop implementing it. A spokesman for the community welfare officers, members of IMPACT and SIPTU, said last week, &ldquo;If there is no movement at Government level we cannot guarantee the staff will continue to operate such a policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers have been entitled to the most basic level of supplementary welfare payments, on the same basis as anyone else who finds himself without income. However, those relocated to accommodation outside Dublin are being restricted to a measly £15 per week or £2.14 per day. Has the Minister of State any idea what it is like to survive on £2.14 discretionary spending? It would not pay for a bus fare, a haircut or a cinema ticket. It would not buy much more than a packet of sweets. The Labour Party believes the social welfare system should be administered on the basis of need and not of nationality or ethnicity. There was a time when Fianna Fáil also believed in that principle.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to asylum seekers is illustrated by his reply to a parliamentary question I tabled today about a man who has been living and working as a translator with the support services in Wexford since June 1997. I asked the Minister if he would review his appeal. The man is a volunteer with organisations dealing with refugees and asylum seekers in Wexford and is a qualified carpenter. The Minister's response was harsh and uncaring but very blunt. Concluding a long reply the Minister said: &ldquo;The person referred to is due to be removed from the State today&rdquo;. I ask the Minister of State to put a human face on this inhuman policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not accept that dispersal in itself causes hardship. The reality is quite simply that had the Government not decided on a policy of dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country, they would be facing very real hardship because the supply of available accommodation in Dublin has been exhausted. Apart from the shortage of accommodation in Dublin, it is not desirable from an integration point of view to have all asylum seekers located in the capital. Large concentrations of asylum seekers in inner city Dublin are likely to lead to ghettoisation. Indeed submissions received by the Minister from a number of organisations whose <i>raison d'être</i> is the protection and promotion of refugee interests have supported a policy of resettlement of asylum seekers on a nationwide basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the emergency which arose due to the shortage of accommodation in the Dublin area, it became necessary to resettle asylum seekers to suitable accommodation throughout the <Col N="1478" /> country. The alternative of leaving asylum seekers homeless could not be countenanced by the Government.</P>
    <P>In October 1999 the Government announced that asylum seekers should be resettled throughout the country and may have their needs met by direct provision. Arising from this decision the Directorate for Refugee and Asylum Support Services has been established under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to co-ordinate the management of services for asylum seekers. Staff from the various Departments and agencies, including the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards, which have a role in this area, have been seconded to the directorate. This approach reflects the Government's concern to provide for all the needs of asylum seekers in a co-ordinated and coherent fashion. The directorate is currently preparing a policy document which will outline a strategic approach to ensure the success of resettlement and such an approach will prevent the marginalisation of asylum seekers within host communities.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the priority of the directorate has been to locate and acquire suitable accommodation around the country as a matter of urgency. The availability of sufficient accommodation is a major problem. If the rate of asylum seekers entering the country continues at recent levels, the number of asylum seekers in the year 2000 will be between 12,000 and 15,000 or even greater. There is no option but to locate asylum seekers throughout the country. Our European neighbours are also experiencing an increase in the number of asylum applications and shortages of accommodation. All possible options must be considered to ensure that asylum seekers are not left homeless.</P>
    <P>The directorate is currently consulting a number of other Departments, State agencies and non-governmental organisations with a view to achieving a planned and orderly system of resettlement which will be sensitive to the needs of not alone the family unit but cultures and the ethnic background of the applicant. Arrangements are in place to ensure that those asylum seekers located outside Dublin have the same access to legal and other services as asylum seekers in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Radon gas is a matter of increasing concern to the people and this concern has been heightened by information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and published in national newspapers on 19 February. Thirteen of the schools surveyed have radon gas levels so high that immediate remedial action is required. The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, disclosed in January that some schools have radon levels above the 200 becquerels per cubic metre safety limit or reference level, as it is known technically. <Col N="1479" /> It took a request under the Freedom of Information Act to find out that the number of schools was in double figures and that in some of these the radon gas levels are alarmingly high. It is alarming to learn that levels are as high as 2,688 becquerels in St. Mogue's College, Bawnboy, County Cavan. A number of other schools have levels of well more than 1,000 becquerels. These figures are many times the reference level above which there is a need for remedial action. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland informs us that lifetime exposure to radon gas at the reference level carries a one in 50 risk of contracting fatal lung cancer. This is twice the risk of death by road accident. Exposure to the levels revealed in the 13 schools carries a far higher risk. Pupils and staff in high radon schools are daily exposed to life threatening levels of radiation. It is absolutely essential that the Minister moves swiftly to eliminate this risk in our schools.</P>
      <P>Since 1998 surveys have been conducted in schools throughout the State by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland but the testing scheme is totally unsatisfactory. Schools have been invited to participate and if they do not take up the invitation they are not tested. Pupils and staff are thus left with possibly very high levels of radon gas undetected in the buildings where they spend most of the day. According to the 1998 annual report of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland 20% of schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow did not participate in the survey in that year. In actual terms that translates into almost 200 schools declining the opportunity to be screened for radon risk in that year.</P>
      <P>That was the first phase of the school survey. What is the participation level in the current phase? Given the very high level of radon discovered in 13 of the schools surveyed so far it is surely necessary to expand the scheme to cover all schools. The Minister should make the survey State wide and ensure every single school is included. I understand this is a simple, straightforward and inexpensive test to perform but whatever the cost it is surely necessary to assess and eliminate the risk to the health of the children and staff in our schools and to those in other workplaces.</P>
      <P>The documents published under the Freedom of Information Act also show that an assistant principal in the Department of Education and Science urged it to address all 13 schools immediately. Has this been done and how quickly and in what manner has the Department responded? Is it the case that school boards of management must bear the cost of taking remedial action to eliminate the risk? In some cases this would entail very significant reconstruction costs, especially in old school buildings. I urge the Minister to introduce a scheme whereby those schools found to have radon gas over the reference level would be granted the cost of rectifying the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> Clearly there is a need for a widespread public information campaign on the risks of radon gas. I urge the Minister and his colleagues in other relevant Departments to initiate such a campaign and to provide the necessary resources for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to inform the public, conduct the surveys and ensure remedial action is taken quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to address the House on an issue that I know is a cause of concern for many people, particularly parents of children attending school, teachers and school managerial authorities. Radon is a natural radioactive gas that has no taste, smell or colour and requires special equipment to detect its presence. It is found in all soils and rocks to some degree but the amount can vary in different parts of the country and at different times of the year. It is formed in the ground, rises to the surface and in the open air is quickly diluted to low or harmless concentrations in the atmosphere. Once it percolates into an enclosed space however it can accumulate and it is for this reason that the Department of Education and Science in 1998 commissioned a national survey of radon levels in all primary and second level schools.</P>
      <P>This survey is being undertaken in three phases and involves the measurement of radon concentration over a full school year in every occupied ground floor in the participating schools. The results of the first phase covering counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow have been issued to participating schools. Arising from this phase of the survey the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, directed officials within his Department to take immediate steps to appoint consultants to devise remediation programmes for schools showing radon levels in excess of the national reference level with priority being given to the cases of greatest need.</P>
      <P>A total of 175 schools spread across the ten counties which participated in the first phase of the national survey showed radon levels in excess of the national reference levels with 13 schools showing levels that require remediation as soon as is practicable. A consultant has been engaged to advise on this task. Five schools have been inspected by the consultant who is preparing a remediation programme for each school. This is expected to be ready shortly. The remaining eight schools will be inspected by the consultant in early March. Work on remediation will be undertaken in such a way that disruption to the operation of schools is minimised. For that reason it is planned to undertake the work during normal school holiday periods when schools are closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remediation programmes for the remaining less affected schools will be drawn up with priority being given to the areas of greatest need following the appointment of a consultant. In this <Col N="1481" /> regard it is necessary that the contract for the appointment of an expert to advise on mitigation in the remaining schools requiring attention be advertised in the EU journal in compliance with public procurement procedures. It is anticipated that an expert will be appointed in the near future. All schools have received information on radon and will be kept informed of new developments. The Department of Education and Science will meet the cost of mitigation.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the survey is ongoing and covers schools in counties Donegal, Dublin, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon and Sligo. The third phase will be undertaken over the 2000-01 school year and will address the remainder of the country. Schools which declined to participate in the earlier phases of the survey will be invited to participate.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue on behalf of the 600 students of Coláiste Eoin and the CBS secondary school, Youghal, County Cork. As I am sure the Minister of State is aware I have raised it on a number of occasions by way of parliamentary question. I understand the constraints under which he has been working but in the current economic climate I urge him to consider the situation again. When I visited the school recently I was presented with a petition by one of the students asking me to intervene with the Minister and the Department of Education and Science to have the decision changed.</P>
      <P>Up to 1995 students were dropped off each morning and picked up each evening at a central point from where they had to walk more than half a mile up a very steep hill carrying heavy schoolbags &ndash; another issue at which the Minister of State might look &ndash; as well as sports gear such as hurleys and coats, to attend school, very often in very wet weather. Thankfully a decision was made to drop them at the school in the morning. The problem is that on leaving school in the evening they have to travel more than half a mile back down a very steep hill to the pick-up point which is situated on one of the busiest roads in the country, the N25, where they mingle with up to 500 other students from the Loreto secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a tragedy waiting to happen. We all know what youngsters can get up to when they get together. There is messing and fooling. My fear and that of parents and teachers is that at some stage a student will be pushed out on to the main road and killed. I implore the Minister of State therefore to look at the matter again and to make funds available &ndash; I am informed that it would cost about £2,000 a year or £12 a day, which is not a huge amount of money &ndash; to enable the students to be picked up outside the school. This is vitally important for safety reasons. It is also important for health reasons, because the hill to <Col N="1482" /> which I refer is quite steep and if one of those students should fall or stumble going down that hill, he or she could be seriously injured. The parents and teachers are very concerned about this.</P>
    <P>I am told there is a danger that a precedent might be set, but there is no other town like this. I would ask the Minister to intervene with the Department. Bus Éireann has no problem in providing the service. In fact, it is anxious to do so because it is aware of the difficulties and the dangers.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of almost 1,000 students in Youghal. I ask the Minister to indicate that he will at least look favourably on the request I am making on their behalf. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter since it affords me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position regarding school transport to the Youghal, County Cork, post-primary schools. One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department, ensures that all routes are examined with regard to the suitability of the roads for the various types of vehicles used. Safe set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind. School bus routes are monitored on a regular basis by Bus Éireann and if conditions deteriorate or dangers arise, services are revised to ensure safety.</P>
      <P>In many towns, where there are a number of post-primary schools, pupils are dropped off and collected at a central point in the town, and are expected to make their own way to and from their respective schools. The position in Youghal is that up to 1995, pupils were dropped off and collected at a central point outside the Loreto Convent each morning and afternoon, and made their own way to and from their respective schools.</P>
      <P>In 1995, it was decided by my Department, as an exceptional matter, to extend the services in the morning to the CBS and Coláiste Eoin as the pupils had to make their way up a steep hill to get to their respective schools. Buses continued to collect pupils at the central point near Loreto Convent in the afternoons and this remains the position.</P>
      <P>The distance from CBS and Coláiste Eoin to Loreto Convent is 0.8 miles, and 0.7 miles taking the shortest route <i>via</i> Windmill Hill. Windmill Hill is a steep public road, but is not considered to be any less safe than similar roads used by pupils throughout the country. The shortest walking route is <i>via</i> Bushy Lane, which is a steep path with a very rough surface and is not considered suitable for walking. The distance between the CBS and Coláiste Eoin and Loreto Convent <i>via </i>Bushy Lane is 0.4 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To apply the terms of the school transport <Col N="1483" /> scheme in a fair and consistent manner, it would not be open to my Department to extend school services to the CBS and Coláiste Eoin schools in the afternoon. To extend a service in such circumstances, where significant extra cost is involved, <Col N="1484" /> would set a precedent, for which I simply do not have resources within the allocation made to me for school transport.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.04 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 March 2000.</P>

This document is under consideration by the Garda SMI implementation steering group established by the Government in early 1998 to oversee the implementation of the report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The working document is the subject of ongoing consultations with the relevant staff associations and unions.

      <P>The serious problem of child pornography on the Internet is one which involves a wide range of complex legal and technical issues. A Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet established by my Department recommended in 1998 the introduction of a system of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry as the most appropriate response to these issues. Specifically, in relation to child pornography, the group recommended the establishment of a public hotline for reporting child pornography and the setting up of an Internet advisory board to monitor and oversee the system of self-regulation.</P>
      <P>Much progress has been made in implementing these recommendations of the working group. In November last, the service provider industry, with assistance from my Department, established a national public hotline to process complaints of child pornography on the Internet. The Internet Advisory Board has also now been established and is due to hold its inaugural meeting later this week.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the problem of child pornography on the Internet is essentially an international one and while domestic initiatives can and will be taken, this international dimension is critical. Officials from my Department do, accordingly, play an active role at European and international fora in designing and supporting initiatives which address this problem.</P>
      <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act which I introduced in 1998 is also an essential element in ensuring that the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear on those who are involved in child pornography activities on the Internet within this jurisdiction. The gardaí are involved on an ongoing basis with the investigation of child pornography offences under this Act.</P>

      <P>On 11 May 1999, during an operation at night in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda Air Support Unit helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was discontinued and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon airport. The helicopter was not forced to make an emergency landing.</P>
      <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations &ndash; including that &ldquo;The Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by GASU pilots&rdquo;. This recommendation was accepted and is being acted upon.</P>
      <P>The question of the allocation of pilots, their experience levels and their training programmes is, in the first instance, a matter for the Air Corps and the Minister for Defence. Nevertheless, I obviously have a keen interest in the context of its effect on GASU operations.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department and the Garda authorities &ndash; in conjunction with officials from the Department of Defence and the Air Corps &ndash; have been actively pursuing the issues raised in the report.</P>

      <P>On 21 July 1999, the Government approved the transfer of the head office of the Legal Aid Board to Cahirciveen, County <Col N="1488" /> Kerry and authorised the Office of Public Works to source an appropriate building in the area for the board's use.</P>
      <P>Following an advertisement in the national and local press inviting proposals from owners of potentially suitable sites in the Cahirciveen area the Office of Public Works has identified an appropriate site for the relocated head office of the board and I understand negotiations for its purchase are in progress.</P>
      <P>The proposed number of staff to be located to Cahirciveen is 39 but when account is taken of the staff at dual locations, the total number of staff working from the Cahirciveen base will be 42.</P>
      <P>With regard to the staffing of the relocated head office, an internal circular recently issued within the Legal Aid Board inviting declarations of interest from staff in the move to Cahirciveen. I am informed that a small number responded and that the board then, in line with normal decentralisation procedures, requested the Department of Finance to issue an interdepartmental circular seeking applicants from throughout the Civil Service. Both staff and unions are being kept fully informed of all developments in relation to the transfer.</P>
      <P>While a small number of staff have indicated an interest in a transfer, I should mention that a further number have expressed an interest in moving in the event of promotional opportunities becoming available in Cahirciveen.

      <P>Since its establishment in July 1998, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism has received an increase each year in its funding. In 1998, it received £20,000. This amount was increased to £90,000 in 1999, which was the committee's first full year of operation, and an allocation of £150,000 has been provided to the committee to fund its operations this year. The committee has also been provided by my Department with an office premises and facilities in Dublin. In addition to funding provided by my Department, I understand £50,000 has been allocated to the committee by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, under the community development programme to establish a community development support unit for community groups working with refugees and asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the four months from I October 1999 to the end of February 2000, 11 unauthorised takings of vehicles were recorded by the gardai at Blessington. Three attempted unauthorised takings were recorded. In the Manor Kilbride area, two attempted unauthorised takings were recorded in the same period.</P>
      <P>Local Garda management has responded to the situation by implementing the operation of strategically placed vehicle checkpoints on the routes used by the car thieves; intensive patrolling of these routes; and the collation and dissemination of criminal intelligence on car thieves.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that some of the problems referred to in the question are caused by cars being stolen in Dublin, and then being abandoned or burned in County Wicklow. The problem is manifest at weekends, and targeted patrolling has been introduced by gardai at Tallaght and Rathfarnham as a response. In relation to burnt out wrecks littering the landscape, An Garda Síochána is in co-operation with the local authorities regarding their removal and scrappage, once the appropriate inquiries have been completed.

      <P>Development work on the new Garda IT systems known as the PULSE project began in August 1996 and was expected to take four years to complete. What was aimed at in this project was to provide the Garda with state-of-the-art systems in 17 operational areas. Much of the development work involved original design of software and systems.</P>
      <P>For such a complex and large project it has remained relatively close to target in terms of cost and time. The project as a whole is, I understand, a number of months behind schedule largely due to two factors, the need to concentrate in the latter half of last year in achieving Y2K compliance and to the industrial relations position whereby gardaí did not co-operate, for a period last year, with the introduction of PULSE.</P>
      <P>It has always been the intention to introduce PULSE on a phased basis. Work on the first two planned releases was completed last year and these are being rolled out to Garda stations. In the meantime, planning and design of a further two releases for later this year is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The new PULSE systems represent a major change in how gardaí record incidents and crimes and a major feature of the PULSE project is to equip and skill all members of the Garda to use the systems. To progress the training that is needed in a manageable and coherent way it was decided to break into two phases, the first where gardaí would be taught how to make inquiries and retrieve information on the new systems and the second, and perhaps more critical phase, where members would be taught how to input information into the systems.</P>
      <P>To allow training to progress in this way, a team of gardaí from divisions around the country were brought together and trained to input data which would initially be sent to them from stations in paper form. This is the task which is being done at Fitzgibbon Street. However, this is purely a temporary expedient. As the input training to which I referred progresses this unit will gradually be disbanded and its members will bring the knowledge and skills they have acquired back to their divisions thus helping to further the overall training process.</P>
      <P>As to the question of problems with the new PULSE systems, I am informed that there are some teething problems but nothing beyond what might normally be expected in the first weeks of live operations of such a new and complex system. I am told that the problems which have arisen are solvable and that necessary adjustments are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to a backlog of forms at Fitzgibbon Street, I am informed that this grew up mainly as a result of the industrial relations problem at the end of last year and that it is being sorted out. I understand that all forms sent to the data entry <Col N="1492" /> centre from the beginning of this year have been dealt with immediately and that in terms of current data the system is therefore up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees in Ireland was launched on 10 February 2000.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome and accept the findings in the report. The Government recognises the importance of creating an environment which is positive towards the welcoming of refugees and consequently has approved the report. It agrees with the recommendations and has approved my proposal that these should form the framework for Government policy on integration.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the recommendations, including the key recommendations with regard to an organisational structure for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy and making mainstream services more accessible, will be implemented without delay. I will bring proposals in relation to structures to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the key recommendations in the report is that the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism should have <Col N="1493" /> a central role in co-ordinating public awareness initiatives and in disseminating information on anti-racism issues and respect for cultural diversity. The Government has agreed that the NCCRI will undertake an evaluation of how public opinion can be better informed with a view to promoting a tolerant, inclusive society. This evaluation will be completed in a short timeframe and I intend to bring proposals for comprehensive public awareness initiatives to Government before the summer.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee also recommended the conduct of research to obtain information on the specific needs of refugees. In this regard, I will commission a research project with a view to the development of a comprehensive strategy for integration. This strategy will identify in further detail the scope to maximise existing resources in both the State and voluntary sector to facilitate integration.</P>
    <P>My aim and that of the Government is to ensure that all appropriate assistance is given to facilitate the integration into Irish society of persons granted refugee status or given leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 69 of 23 November 1999 on the issue of assaults on traffic wardens.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a person who assaults a traffic warden in the course of his or her duty or otherwise can be prosecuted under the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 where there is evidence available to sustain a conviction against the alleged offender. Section 2 of the Act of 1997 creates the offence of assault, section 3, assault causing harm and section 4 creates the offence of assault causing serious harm. This legislation applies nationwide. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that a change in legislation is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also refer the Deputy to a reply by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to Question No. 226 of 29 February 2000 in which it is stated that any person who obstructs a traffic warden acting in the course of his or her employ<Col N="1494" /> ment shall be guilty of an offence. Under section 5 of the Local Government (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975, local authorities may prosecute offenders who obstruct a traffic warden acting in the course of his or her duty. The Act of 1975 applies to local authority appointed traffic wardens only.</P>
    <P>Of course, where offences of assaulting traffic wardens, including local authority employed traffic wardens, are brought to the attention of the gardaí appropriate action, including prosecutions, are taken. Finally, if particular instances of assaults on traffic wardens have been brought to the attention of the Deputy I would ask him to ensure the assaults are reported to the local gardaí.</P>

      <P>A Garda CCTV system &ndash; comprising 24 cameras &ndash; has been in operation in Tralee since September 1998.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the CCTV cameras in Tralee Garda station are monitored for the full 24 hour period each day by the member performing duty in the communications room. This member also performs other duties.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that a member is assigned to full time dedicated monitoring of the cameras at certain times during the day. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to state publicly these exact times. The member concerned is assigned to this duty only and the member in the communications room is still in a position to assist the member on dedicated CCTV duty as there is a monitor and a control panel at his or her disposal which allows the member in the communications room to view any of the 24 monitors in the CCTV room. The CCTV room is immediately adjoining the communications room and separated by a glass panel.</P>
      <P>A review of our policy on CCTV is under way and the approach to monitoring of CCTV cameras is being examined in that context.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that there has been a major decrease in recorded crime in Tralee since 1996 &ndash; with the overall reduction in the period 1996-99 being in the order of 35%. The relevant information in this regard is as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>The majority of persons immigrating to the State are either Irish or EEA nationals who are entitled to enter employment in Ireland without any prior authorisation &ndash; EEA consists of the EU states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain exceptions, non EEA nationals require a work permit prior to taking up employment in Ireland. The work permit scheme is administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and decisions on applications are taken by that Department having regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> the skills or qualifications of the person concerned and the capacity of the applicant firm to recruit a suitable EEA national candidate. More than 6,000 such permits issued during 1999.</P>
      <P>In the year to end-February, 9,096 persons applied for asylum in Ireland. In so far as the Deputy's question relates to the skills possessed by applicants for asylum, the position is that, while applicants may provide information relating to their profession and skills in the course of making their application, such information is not used in assessing the validity of the applicant's case for refugee status. I would emphasise to the Deputy that the purpose of the asylum system is to protect persons fleeing persecution; it has nothing to do with meeting skill shortages that exist in the labour force. With regard to those asylum applicants who are eligible to work under the terms of the Government decision of 26 July 1999, I understand that FÁS has made arrangements to assess the skills and job prospects of the persons in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> Persons who are recognised as refugees or given leave to remain having been in an asylum process may take up employment without the need to obtain a work permit and may access FÁS and related State services on the same basis as an Irish-EEA national. A total of 580 persons have been granted refugee status in the 12 months to end February and 42 failed asylum applicants have been granted temporary leave to remain during the same period.</P>

Under these regulations a bicycle must have a front and rear light, duly lit, and a reflector during lighting up time.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the regulations is given a high priority by the gardaí as part of their overall road safety strategy.

The activities of the main players in the drugs scene have been put under surveillance and valuable information has been obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Specific legislative provisions apply to family law proceedings, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, <Col N="1500" /> 1976, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, which require the court to hold proceedings otherwise than in public. There is also a general provision in the law which gives the court discretion in other family law proceedings to hold them otherwise than in public and the general practice is to invoke this discretion. My Department continues to keep the law in this area under review.</P>
      <P>In its 1996 report on family courts, the Law Reform Commission affirmed the importance of the right to privacy in family law cases on the basis that they frequently involve detailed discussion of personal relationships. However, the commission recommend that access by a bona fide researcher to such proceedings should be allowed by a judge subject to refusal only on the basis of compelling and stated reasons and that the attendance of students of family law should be allowed at the discretion of the judge. The commission's report was preceded by a Consultation Paper of 1994. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Law Reform Commission's recommendations fall far short of any major relaxation of the in camera rule, as it is called, for family law proceedings.</P>
      <P>In its sixth report, the Working Group on a Courts Commission, established to review the operation of the courts, expressed support for the Law Reform Commission's proposal. It stated that a balance should be found between the right of privacy of litigants and children in family law cases and the right to a fair, transparent and accountable system of justice in the area. It also stated that policy reform, research, accountability and provision of adequate services cannot take place without accurate statistics from the courts on a regular basis. With these aims in mind, it recommended that a pilot project be set up for a period of one year whereby a researcher, who could be a barrister or a solicitor, would be appointed to work in the area. Such a researcher would have access to the family courts but would have the responsibility of ensuring that there would be no breach of the right to privacy of the individual litigant.</P>
      <P>I understand the Courts Service, which now has responsibility for the management of the courts and the provision of information on the courts system to the public, is currently examining the matter with a view to establishing as soon as possible a pilot project as recommended by the working group on a courts commission.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, I recently announced the allocation of £16 million in funding over the next six years under the national development plan for the significant expansion of the Garda youth diversion programme in urban and rural areas. These projects aim, through a combination of intervention and preventive actions, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity and its consequences. The long-term objective is to enable the target group of ten to 18 year olds to integrate into the labour force in a systematic manner and to prevent them from becoming unemployable.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to implement the proposal for expanding the number of projects on a phased basis over the life of the plan. Locations are being considered, having regard to the local needs as assessed by the Garda Síochána in conjunction with my Department.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to finalise details shortly on the first phase of this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to my recent announcement that the Government has approved the drafting of a criminal justice Bill to improve generally the criminal justice system by giving additional powers to the Garda Síochána and by removing certain anomalies from criminal legislation.</P>
      <P>The background to the proposals is that in November 1997, the report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, commonly referred to as the Garda SMI report, was published. While the report of the steering group dealt mostly with the structures and functions of the Garda Síochána, it also recommended certain changes in criminal law to enhance Garda efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering group acknowledged that the implications of their proposals would need to be further assessed in the light of the provisions of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. Accordingly, I appointed an expert group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Eamon Leahy, SC, with a specific mandate to consider the changes recommended in the context of Constitutional and European Convention <Col N="1504" /> on Human Rights implications, as well as the need to maintain the critical balance between the rights of the individual and the common good. The expert group included legal practitioners, representatives from the Offices of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Deputy Commissioner &ndash; operations &ndash; of An Garda Síochána and officials from my Department. The group made its report at the end of July 1998. In general, the expert group supported the general thrust of most of the steering group's recommendations but made suggestions on how the recommendations could be developed in a way which respected that critical balance between the rights of the individual and the common good.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I have recently secured Government approval for the drafting of a Bill based on the expert group report, and the detailed provisions of the Bill will now be developed during the drafting of the Bill in the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman. While the House will appreciate that I am not in a position to give full details of my proposals until such time as they are published following approval by the Government, I can say that in relation to the specific matters mentioned in the Deputy's question my proposals are largely based on the expert group's report.</P>
    <P>In relation to periods of detention for persons in custody, the Deputy will be aware that there are a number of statutory provisions which provide for the detention of suspects viz. section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, as amended by section 10 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998 which applies to all offences contemplated by the Offences against the State legislation, section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 which applies to arrestable offences, offences punishable by five years imprisonment or more and section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which applies to drug trafficking offences. These differing provisions can create certain anomalies. For example, a person suspected of murder can be detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act for up to 12 hours, but if there is evidence of the use of a firearm in the murder that person can be detained for up to 72 hours under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>The Steering Group on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of An Garda Síochána considered the period of detention permitted under the 1984 Act to be inadequate for the proper investigation of certain serious or complex offences and had recommended that the 1984 Act be amended to provide for a total of 96 hours detention. The expert group, however, recommended that a provision permitting detention for up to 48 hours would be sufficient and should only apply in respect of the more serious offences. I am proposing to accept the expert group's recommendation on the basis that it will apply only to the most serious category of offences including for example, murder or rape.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> In relation to further restrictions to the right to silence, the expert group recommended that a provision along the lines of section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 should be extended to all arrestable offences. The steering group had suggested a somewhat wider application. Section 7 of the 1996 Act, and section 5 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, provide that adverse inferences can be drawn from an accused's decision, when being questioned or charged by the gardaí in relation to a drug trafficking offence, or an offence contemplated by the offences against the State legislation, to remain silent and not mention facts which he or she later relies on at trial. Such adverse inferences could corroborate other evidence, but would not alone be sufficient for a conviction. While I accept the thrust of the expert group's recommendation, I am proposing also in this case to limit its application to the most serious category of offences.</P>
    <P>In relation to further safeguards for persons in custody, these proposals are being put forward against the background of Government approval in July 1999 for the introduction of a nationwide scheme of electronic recording of Garda questioning of detained persons. The national scheme will provide for the mandatory audio-video recording of interviews with persons detained in Garda custody under the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984; the Offences against the State Act, 1939, as amended; the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996; and this Bill, when enacted. I expect a significant number of stations will be equipped for electronic recording of interviews before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the 1987 regulations governing treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations will, of course, be applied to the detention provisions of the Bill when, enacted. In addition, I propose to submit proposals to Government for improvements in the operation of the statutory Garda Síochána complaints scheme.</P>

Attendance at ILETS is by invitation only and participation varies from issue to issue.</P>
      <P>All of the member states of the European Union are parties to the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Parties to the convention are committed to helping each other in relation to criminal proceedings, such as obtaining evidence in one country for use in another, or serving summonses issued in one country or another. The member states of the European Union are currently engaged in negotiations on a convention the aim of which is to supplement the 1959 convention as it applies to them. Negotiations on the convention are continuing. Among the measures proposed for inclusion in the convention are provisions to regulate among member states the interception of telecommunications across borders in criminal matters.</P>
      <P>Also on the EU front, international requirements for interception were developed for the guidance of the telecommunications industry. These requirements were adopted by Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications and were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities No. C329 of 4 November 1996.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 73 on 2 February last, the information sought regarding the number of minors arrested in each of the Dublin metropolitan areas during 1999 is not readily available. In addition, the Garda authorities point out that the distinction between arrests and persons being made amenable should be borne in mind. For example, not all arrests lead to a person being made amenable for an offence.</P>
      <P>Juvenile offenders &ndash; persons under 18 years of age &ndash; made amenable for offences are reported to the Garda national juvenile office. This includes persons who are arrested and those who are detected without arrest for no insurance, driving licence, etc. For the year 1999 some 15,554 referrals for juvenile offenders were received at the national juvenile office. This represents a 4% increase on the figure for 1998, which was in turn 7% lower than the 1997 figure.</P>
      <P>The causes of crime are so varied that a response from the criminal justice system alone is not sufficient. The interdepartmental committee established in 1992 to report on urban crime and disorder stated that, whatever their relative significance, factors such as unemployment, lack of educational opportunity, environmental conditions and lack of family supervision were typical of a problem area. This is why I strongly support a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling crime in urban areas. Such an approach has been adopted, for example, by the Garda youth diversion schemes funded by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has already put in place various programmes to deal wit the issues of social disadvantage and urban deprivation, such as the integrated services process, the national anti-poverty strategy and the establishment of the national drugs strategy team, all of which aim to develop local responses to local issues. The importance of a co-ordinated approach by Government agencies is also exem<Col N="1508" /> plified by the young people's facilities and services fund, which supports a variety of projects in disadvantaged areas, such as measures to counter early school leaving and to provide for children at risk and their families.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, indictable crime statistics can be found in the annual reports of An Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details the crime statistics for 1998. While Garda crime statistics for 1999 have not yet been formally published, I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional statistics for that year indicate that 38 murders were recorded, 31 of which were detected.</P>
      <P>Provisional statistics from 1 January 2000 to 3 March 2000 show ten murders, with six detected. These figures are provisional, and subject to change as Garda investigations progress. The annual report of An Garda Síochána will contain the final figures in respect of 1999 when it is published later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> As the Deputy will appreciate while the term &ldquo;gangland killing&rdquo; is widely used by the media, it does not correspond to the manner in which Garda Síochána classify crime. All murders are the subject of exhaustive investigation by the Garda regardless of the circumstances of how they occurred. The Garda cannot rule out the possibility that organised criminal gangs may have been involved in some of these murders.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on family courts, which issued in 1996, covered areas such as regional family courts, information centres, mediation and judicial training. All the recommendations have the common aim of ensuring a proper service is provided to the public and in particular, that the rights and interests of children involved in the process are fully protected in our courts.</P>
      <P>The working group on a Courts Commission also tabled recommendations in this area in 1998, many of which mirrored those of the Law Reform Commission. In particular, this group welcomed the expansion by the Government of the family mediation service and the civil legal aid scheme. The recommendations of both groups are now being addressed by the Courts Service which was established by me in November 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government has responded in a meaningful way to the Law Reform Commission's report. I would point in particular to the increased financial resources now provided for judicial training and the recent decision of the Courts Service to locate all its family law business in Dublin in a purpose built family law centre. The new building will be constructed on a site adjacent to the Four Courts and will have modern court and office accommodation, with proper facilities for the Judiciary, staff, the legal profession, litigants, the public and all those who have an involvement in family law cases. There will be sufficient courtrooms provided to meet the foreseeable demands in the family law area of the District, Circuit and High Courts in Dublin. This initiative is a significant response to many of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. It should also be noted that wherever court accommodation is being replaced or upgraded, special facilities are being put in place for family law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key issues in the Government Action Plan for the Millennium is the establishment of regional family courts. The Courts Service has been informed of this Government <Col N="1510" /> objective in the context of the development of Courts Service policy.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission made the point in their report that most if not all of its recommendations were conditional upon the provision of substantial additional resources. These resources have been provided by the Government as can be seen from the overall financial provision for the Courts Service for the current year which stands at £59 million, an increase of 24% over 1999. Within that financial provision money is being provided to cover all the areas touched on by the commission in its report in which the courts have a function.</P>
    <P>Most of these matters do not require legislation but I will not hesitate to introduce legislation should this prove necessary to make progress on any of the other issues arising out of the report.</P>

      <P>As I have said previously, I welcome the publication of the Central Statistics Office survey data which were rigorous, comprehensive and unique. This is the first time a nationwide survey of this scale was carried out by the Central Statistics Office and I hope this would become a regular feature of the CSO work programme so that trends could be monitored over a period of time.</P>
      <P>I must highlight, however, that the CSO drew attention to the fact that &ldquo;the survey results are not directly comparable with crime statistics published in the Garda Síochána annual report, as there are fundamental differences in sources, definitions and classification methodology&rdquo;. It is also worth noting that the CSO has highlighted that the survey data are subject to sampling variation and that some of the results should be interpreted with extreme caution. We are not comparing like with like and this is always crucial when comparing any two data collection systems if robust conclusions are to be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main benefit of surveys such as these is to compare the trends which emerge from them over time. Unfortunately, there is little recent work to compare it with and there is no evidence that under-reporting of crime is higher now than it was at any other time. The logical conclusion is that if one in eight households experienced some level of crime in 1998 the comparative figure for 1996 was probably one in six given that reported <Col N="1511" /> crime figures has shown a significant drop in that period.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that in terms of international comparisons for surveys of this type Ireland compares favourably with similar countries for example England, Canada and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, I urge the public to report any crime which causes them concern to the Garda authorities. My Department is considering the implications of results of the CSO survey and I understand that the National Crime Council is also considering the results of the survey.</P>

      <P>The comments referred to by the Deputy were made in a report which has been available to me since late 1999. I have been acutely aware of the problem of hepatitis infection and the associated drug problem in our prisons for some time. At my request, research has been completed on the prevalence and risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV in Irish prisoners. The relevant report in this respect was published in late August 1999. The report found that infection with hepatitis C among the prisoners who took part in the survey was 37%. However, the preva<Col N="1512" /> lence of hepatitis C among declared drug users was found to be 80%. These figures are similar to the prevalence of infection among drug users in the community.</P>
      <P>Information on HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C is routinely available to all prisoners through prison medical and other staff. Prisoners diagnosed with any of these conditions are automatically referred to specialist clinics in external hospitals for assessment and advice in relation to current or envisaged treatment needs. Any recommended treatment is provided to prisoners while in prison.</P>
      <P>A steering committee on communicable diseases has been at work in my Department for some time dealing specifically with this important issue. In addition, the director of the Prison Medical Service, in his annual report for 1998, recommended an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. I had no hesitation in accepting his recommendation and a multi-disciplinary group has recently been established to conduct this review.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has also drawn attention to the comments in the report regarding the provision of methadone maintenance. Professional advice available to me is that the provision of a methadone maintenance programme in prisons could result in a reduction in viral spread. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved last year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. The provision of methadone maintenance is an integral part of this plan. The plan also includes the expansion of detoxification facilities and the provision of more drug free areas.</P>
      <P>At my request the director general of the Prisons Service recently established a National Steering Group for Prison Based Drug Treatment Services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from my Department, the Eastern Health Board, senior prisons service management and the Probation and Welfare Service. The director general has agreed to chair the steering group himself to signal the importance that is attached by the prison authorities and Government to this issue. The group has invited submissions from the general public as well as from special interest groups in relation to its review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are referring to the £560 million provision in the national development plan for a new technology foresight fund. This fund is an integral element of the £1.95 billion provision in the plan for research, technological development and innovation. This unprecedented level of investment, which represents almost 5% of the total funding outlined in the plan, is profound evidence of the high priority which this Government attaches to the role of research and innovation in driving future economic growth.</P>
      <P>The technology foresight fund responds to the recommendations of the Technology Foresight Ireland Reports published last year by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation. ICSTI sought to identify the technologies that could contribute most to economic development in the future and presented a plan of the actions which are needed now to ensure that Ireland can exploit those technologies. The report recommended that our Department should establish a fund for investment in research in niche areas of information and communications technologies and bio-technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, the Tánaiste and I have carried out an extensive consultation process with the objective of deciding on the most appropriate mechanism to disburse this substantial funding. We will announce the outcome of this process at the launch of the technology foresight fund in Dublin Castle tomorrow. I can assure the Deputies that the strengths of the existing research infrastructure have been taken into full consideration during this process. We have list<Col N="1515" /> ened carefully to all of the key players and will ensure that any mechanism which will emerge will be complimentary to, integrated with and work in collaboration with the existing research infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the key to the success of any implementation process will be a partnership involving all the main players in the research system, industry, third level colleges, research institutes and other research funding bodies, including Government Departments and agencies. It would be neither appropriate nor practical to pre-judge the level of financial allocations under this proposed technology foresight fund as this will ultimately be a matter for decision by the management of the fund.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree with the concept of ensuring an open and transparent system of competition and evaluation in any structures that will be introduced. The real objective of the partnership to which I have referred is to ensure that Ireland reaps the rewards of the substantial increase in investment in RTDI. We must get value for money and significant national impact from this investment. I have no doubt that we are at the first stage of an ambitious and exciting time for RTDI which will deliver the type of economic growth which will underpin future competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The annual employment survey undertaken by Forfás indicates that among clients assisted by the development agencies for which I am responsible, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon <Col N="1516" /> Development, 375 establishments closed in 1997, 284 in 1998 and 271 in 1999. A comprehensive presentation relating to the detail of the question is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The table is indicative of the regular life cycle of business, as firms start and grow but with some casualties along the way as market forces take their toll. Employment is dependent on the success or failure of individual firms in the market economy and it is inevitable that some firms will fail, as indeed many more will thrive and generate additional employment and wealth throughout the economy. While job losses are not always avoidable, one objective of enterprise policy is to limit losses as far as possible by helping indigenous companies achieve stronger positions of sustainable competitive advantage. It is an objective of industrial policy to encourage foreign companies that have plants here to become more deeply embedded in the economy as a means of ensuring their prospects of longevity. New foreign investments tend to involve higher value added, more advanced technologies and more knowledge intensive products and services. As such, these tend not to suffer competitive disadvantages to the same extent as firms whose technology is less advanced. Technology, productivity and market driven innovation help firms locating in Ireland to be more resilient to competitive pressures which can lead to job losses.</P>
      <P>Job losses must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, declining unemployment and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy. Last year was the sixth successive year of strong growth and this is reflected in the numbers of new jobs created with the assistance of the development agencies. Among their clients, 120,268 new jobs were created between 1997 and 1999, leaving net employment 54,436 higher. Total employment in the broader economy as measured by the CSO's quarterly national household survey expanded by just over 211,000 in the period April 1997 to the second quarter of 1999 &ndash;  the latest data available.</P>
      <P>I do not have data on the number of companies which failed in the economy generally during the years in question as many of these would operate in the broader services sector which do not come into contact with the support agencies.</P>
      <P>Job Losses due to Closures (IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland* and Shannon Development Client Companies) (1997-99)</P>

This was accepted by my Department at face value and the permits requested were issued to the company in question.

    <P>In keeping with the commitment given by my predecessor during the course of the passage of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999, I intend to establish an eel fisheries strategic review group.

    <P>The review group will assess all issues relating to the development of the sector, including structures, development plans and general regulation of the industry. This will include the development and regulation of the eel fishery in the Shannon catchment. I will be asking the review group to seek and consider submissions from all interested parties, including the association referred to by the Deputy, as part of its consideration and development of an overall strategy.</P>

      <P>The applicable bye-laws in relation to the maximum length of drift net for salmon or trout fishing provide for a general maximum of 732 metres in the southern, south western, Shannon and western fisheries regions and for a general maximum of 1,372 metres in the north western and northern fisheries regions. The bye-laws also provide for lower maxima in certain waters in these fisheries regions and in the eastern fisheries region such as specified tidal waters and bays.</P>
      <P>Technical factors which are relevant in setting of the two general maxima are the performance of drift nets in differing sea conditions and the configuration of the coastline in the various fisheries regions. These factors have a significant bearing on the fishing opportunity provided by a given length of drift net.</P>
      <P>The National Salmon Commission, which will be representative of all the stakeholders, will assist and advise me on policy and strategies in relation to the national salmon resource. The maximum length of drift nets would be included among the range of technical salmon management measures which will also be within the remit of the commission to assess. Any proposal for change in the maximum permitted lengths at present would need to be considered in the light of technical considerations and overall salmon conservation and management policy considerations.</P>

      <P>The Irish coastguard has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport. These helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. Their call-out response time is not more than 15 minutes between 7.30 am and 9 .00 pm and not more than 45 minutes outside these times throughout the year. They are positioned so that they can reach, by day, 40 nautical miles off-shore in one hour and by night or in bad weather, 100 nautical miles in two hours. Search and rescue missions continue to be undertaken by the Air Corps helicopters at Finner, County Donegal and Waterford Airport.</P>
      <P>Additional resources of the Irish coastguard are 65 full-time staff and over 600 volunteers. The coastguard manages and operates three co-ordination/communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to its own resources, the Irish coastguard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. Apart from the two Air Corps search and rescue heli<Col N="1521" /> copters based at Finner and Waterford, these resources include the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast and seven community inshore rescue service boats based in strategic locations. It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the air corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and their divers and UK Coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any impending change in the status of the air corps helicopters which are dedicated to marine search and rescue. I am satisfied that the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts meets both national and international standards for marine search and rescue operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the development of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System maritime radio communications depended on shipborne radiotelegraph and radiotelephone systems. The GMDSS was first developed by the <Col N="1524" /> International Maritime Organisation in the late 1960s. The IMO Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea, to which Ireland is a signatory, was amended to include the GMDSS and that amendment was implemented on a phased basis for merchant ships from 1 February 1992. Furthermore, two EU directives Council Directive 97/70/EC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length or over and Council Directive 98/18/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships, in respect of newly built national passenger ships of 24 metres and above on domestic voyages, extended the provisions of chapter IV of the SOLAS Convention (GMDSS) to both classes of vessel.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the report of the fishing vessel safety review group recommended that radio rules be introduced for all fishing vessels. These recommendations provided for the installation of GMDSS radio installations on board all fishing vessels, to a greater or lesser degree depending on the length of the vessel, and the operating area of each fishing vessel.</P>
      <P>All of the fishing industry representative groups were represented on the review group and the recommendations of the group were implemented in Irish law by the Fishing Vessel (Radio Installations) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 544 of 1998).</P>
      <P>The GMDSS uses both terrestrial and satellite radio communication systems. It provides for electronic distress, urgency and safety alerting and radio watchkeeping. When a vessel needs to send a distress alert it can immediately transmit the identity of the vessel, the position of the vessel and the fact that the vessel is in distress, all at the push of a button.</P>
      <P>This transmission can be made on very high frequency with a range of approximately 30 nautical miles, on medium frequency with a range of approximately 150 miles or on high frequency with a range of thousands of miles depending on the frequency band.</P>
      <P>The GMDSS also requires ships to carry emergency position indicating radio beacons. These devices can be activated either manually or automatically. When activated the devices transmit the identity of the EPIRB/vessel and the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system, through which the EPIRB operates, computes the position of the EPIRB. All of the information is then quickly and automatically routed to a marine rescue co-ordination centre. Ireland, in complying with the IMO SOLAS Convention, has installed GMDSS radio communications equipment at its coastguard radio stations for the reception of distress, urgency, safety and routine communications from ships of all flags within its waters.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there have been problems with the GMDSS, in particular the problem of the transmission of false distress alerts. However, it must be said that the serious efforts which have been made, and which continue to be made, are helping to reduce the number of such incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steps have been taken to modify and improve <Col N="1525" /> equipment design to make it more user friendly. Ireland has been to the forefront in assisting the European Telecommunications Standards Institute with the development and redrafting of technical specifications. Furthermore, the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications Administrations through its working groups and project teams of which Ireland is a member, has developed harmonised radio operator certification standards.</P>
    <P>Within European Administrations, it has been recognised that the best way to improve the GMDSS and maximise its efficiency is to ensure a high standard of training and certification of radio operator personnel. To this end there is an agreed system of harmonised examination syllabii in use within Europe.</P>
    <P>The examinations for GMDSS radio operators are both theoretical and practical. Training courses of an extremely high standard are being provided at Cork and Limerick Institutes of Technology and the BIM training centres and mobile units. These courses culminate in examinations which are set by the marine radio survey office of this Department, on behalf of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The examinations are designed to ensure that the highest quality of GMDSS radio operator is available for both the merchant shipping industry as well as the fishing and pleasure industries.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that the incidents of false alerts emanating from Irish ships are rare. It is also no coincidence that such incidents emanating from European ships &ndash; particularly from those European countries which use the harmonised examination procedures &ndash; are also rare.</P>
    <P>From the information available to me, the position in relation to the United States is that the strategy of the US coastguard is to declare an operational GMDSS sea area for the continental US on 1 March 2000. It is understood that the federal communications commission has granted temporary, conditional waivers of certain rules implementing provisions of the SOLAS Convention relating to GMDSS for small passenger vessels and fishing vessels. These waivers have been granted in recognition that the USCG has not yet been able to complete the planned upgrade of its shore networks required for the GMDSS and it would be unreasonable to require those vessels to install the equipment for high seas operation. It should be noted that these waivers do not apply to EPIRBs, NAVTEX, VHF portable radios and search and rescue radar transponders.</P>
    <P>The same reasons do not exist in Ireland or in continental Europe where Administrations have already provided for GMDSS sea areas, as appropriate. It must be recognised that there is no other global maritime radio communications system now available. I am committed to ensuring the highest safety standards on all Irish vessels and the GMDSS provides the most modern radiocommunications system to assist in the <Col N="1526" /> safety of all sea going personnel including those employed on fishing vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 to 91, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided the opportunity &ldquo;For a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo;. In pursuit of this objective, an Independent Commission on Policing was established under the Chairmanship of Chris Patten to &ldquo;Bring forward proposals for future policing structures and arrangements, including means of encouraging widespread community support for those arrangements&rdquo;. The Patten report, published in September 1999, comprehensively addressed the full range of important and sensitive issues related to policing. The Government, at the time, welcomed the report and said that the early and effective implementation of its recommendations would form an essential aspect of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday 19 January, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made a statement in the House of Commons setting out the British Government's position on the implementation of the Patten report. The Government welcomed the British Government's decision to accept the great majority of the proposals. The Taoiseach, in welcoming the Secretary of State's statement of 19 January, looked forward to seeing &ldquo;a detailed implementation plan and the early publication of the necessary legislation following on from today's statement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The British Government is currently preparing a new Bill on policing in Northern Ireland, as well as preparing specific implementation plans. Regular discussions have taken place and the need for balance in the approach to implementing the report's recommendations, including in the composition of implementation teams, has been consistently stressed.</P>
      <P>The Patten report considered that &ldquo;A mechanism is needed to oversee the changes required of all those involved in the development of the new policing arrangements, and to assure the community that all aspects of our report are being implemented and being seen to be implemented&rdquo;. The Government considers that the speedy appointment of an oversight commissioner is key to the effective implementation of the report. The Government has engaged in detailed discussions with the British authorities on the role of the commissioner and possible candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of factors which will determine the pace of change to policing in Northern Ireland. One is the length of time required to prepare complex and detailed draft legislation and to steer it through the various stages of the legislative process in the British Parliament. Another very important factor is the appointment of the <Col N="1528" /> oversight commissioner. A third, as the Patten report noted is that the implementation of some recommendations may depend, to some extent, &ldquo;on how the security situation develops&rdquo;. We remain in close contact with the British authorities on all issues affecting the speed of implementation, including the question of security assessments.</P>
    <P>The Patten report recommended that &ldquo;There should be a new oath, taken individually by all new and existing police officers, expressing an explicit commitment to upholding human rights&rdquo;. In detailed discussions with the British Government, we clearly expressed our opinion that it would be preferable that all recommendations of the Patten report, including the requirement of a new oath to be taken by all officers, should be fully implemented. On 19 January 2000, the Secretary of State announced the acceptance of the new police oath, as proposed by Patten. However, the oath was to be taken only by new recruits to the police service. The Secretary of State said that he did not &ldquo;Believe it appropriate for already attested officers to take the oath, which would in any case raise significant legal difficulties&rdquo;. The nature of the difficulties was clarified in discussion. All officers would, however, be required to uphold fundamental human rights and accord equal respect to all individuals.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State confirmed that serving officers would be required to behave in accordance with a new code of ethics, provided for in legislation, and emphasising, like the new oath, the priority to be given to human rights. Although the new oath will not be universally applied, the Government welcomes the fact that all officers will be required to fulfil their duties in accordance with the human rights-based approach recommended by Patten.</P>
    <P>In relation to the special branch, the report recommended, as a first step, that the &ldquo;Special branch and crime branch should be brought together under the command of a single assistant chief constable&rdquo;. In his statement on 19 January, the Secretary of State confirmed that the &ldquo;Special branch and CID will both be retained and placed under a single assistant chief constable, as the chief constable believes is desirable, when the security situation permits&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that &ldquo;The support units of special branch should be amalgamated into the wider police service&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;Officers should not spend such long periods in security work as has been common in the past&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Both Governments are agreed on the absolute necessity of bringing about a police service which is fully representative in ethos and composition of the community it serves. The recommendations contained in the Patten report have the potential to bring about such a service &ndash; one which is professional, effective, accountable, representative and widely accepted. The sooner these recommendations are implemented, the nearer we will be to achieving the kind of police service envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <Quest>the level of money set aside in the 2000 budget in his Department for non-governmental organisations; the level of budget paid out to NGOs in 1999; the number in this regard; and if he will make a statement on recent criticisms of his Department over its treatment of NGOs in the allocation of the Government's aid budget.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall level of Ireland Aid support to NGOs has increased significantly in recent years both in money terms and as a proportion of total aid, from £3.4 million or 8.4% of total aid in 1992 to £20.7 million or 15% of total aid in 1998. The final year figures for 1999 are still in preparation but I am confident that these will show a further increase on the 1998 figures. Full details will be contained in the Ireland Aid 1999 annual report which is currently being compiled.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that official development assistance in 2000 will reach £190 million representing 0.30% of forecasted GNP. Some £136 million of this sum covers the Vote for international cooperation, the bulk of which covers the aid activities of Ireland Aid including the bilateral aid programme. The bilateral aid programme has two principal elements, country programmes in six priority countries and a series of separate programmes to which NGOs may apply for funding. These include the NGO co-financing scheme, the human rights and democratisation scheme, and the emergency relief and rehabilitation assistance scheme. Funding allocated to these schemes in 2000 is set to rise by 24% over budgeted figures for 1999.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid provides funding to Irish, Irish-linked and indigenous NGOs and missionary orders. The number of NGOs receiving funding continues to rise. In 1998, for example, under the NGO co-financing scheme, around 350 NGOs received funding. This figure includes over 90 Irish NGOs and missionary orders active in developing countries.</P>
      <P>Funding arrangements are related to the purpose of the different spending programmes and not the nature of the recipient organisations. Funding is also intended to support activities rather than organisations. As funding is project or activity related, funding to any one NGO can also fluctuate from year to year. Activities are appraised on their merits and on the basis of Ireland Aid policies and priorities. Since it will continue to be necessary to apply the criteria of the different funding programmes to funding applications, it is considered that proposals to introduce a separate NGO budget line would serve no practical purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of their capacity and track record, five of the largest Irish NGOs, Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Christian Aid, receive an annual block grant from Ireland Aid for development <Col N="1530" /> projects. My Department is currently in discussion with these NGOs concerning putting these funding arrangements on a multi-annual basis.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that Ireland Aid continues to have a valuable and long standing partnership relationship with Irish NGOs active in development and humanitarian relief assistance, as is evidenced by the substantial funding channelled through NGOs. I greatly value the important work being done by our NGOs and, as Minister, will continue to give strong support to their activities.</P>

In recognition of the urgent equipment modernisation requirements of the Air Corps I was pleased to announce immediately the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence accepts the Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps as the basis for the development of that service. The Government's policy is that the Air Corps will be heavily involved in providing services to agencies outside the Defence Forces. The extent and nature of these services will, of necessity, be a determinant of the type of aircraft to be provided for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The recently established civil-military board tasked with examining urgently a number of issues in relation to Air Corps equipment decisions including those relating to search and rescue cover has been instructed to produce its recommendations by the end of this month. Search and rescue missions continue to be undertaken by Air Corps flying officers using Dauphin helicopters which undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure that they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 111, inclusive, and No. 113 together.</P>
      <P>A preferred option for disposal of BSE-suspect carcases would be the incineration of the entire carcase. There is, however, no suitable public or commercial incineration facility available in Ireland at present. Consequently, as acknowledged by the relevant EU authorities, there is no immediately available alternative to disposal of such carcases other than by burial under strict conditions. The burials which take place involve individual BSE-suspect animals, from which the heads have first been removed and taken for laboratory examination. Such burials take place on the farm of origin under very strict conditions. In excess of 50% of all suspects buried on farms prove negative for BSE. When a BSE suspect has been confirmed positive, after laboratory examination of brain tissue, the remaining animals in the herd are all slaughtered at a designated plant, rendered and destroyed. None of this material is buried on farms or landfill sites. In all cases of burial, the rules of regulation 4 of S.I. 257 of 1994 must be followed. Suspect carcases are buried under license from my Department and under the direct supervision of a Departmental veterinarian. This officer ensures that: the site is located away from water courses; the burial pit is dug to a depth of 10 feet; the head is removed at the edge of the pit and any contaminated soil is buried; and the carcase is covered in quicklime, to accelerate decomposition, before being covered in soil.</P>
      <P>My Department is exploring other options for the disposal of carcases and is anxious to identify and secure feasible arrangements which would enable it to dispense at the earliest opportunity with the need to bury BSE suspect carcases.</P>
      <P>The extensive control measures put in place by my Department as soon as BSE first emerged are supplemented by the removal of materials designated as specified risk material from both the human food and animal feed chains, a prohibition on the use of meat and bonemeal for ruminant animals and a comprehensive set of licensing and control measures for feeding stuffs which are rigorously enforced by my Department. All the removed SRM material is destroyed and is disposed of outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the incidence of BSE in Ireland is extremely low. In 1999 a total of 95 animals were confirmed as having BSE, from a national herd of close to 8 million cattle. This equates to a disease incidence risk of one in 100,000 or 0.001%. While it is disappointing, although not entirely surprising that the overall numbers were somewhat higher in 1999, there are <Col N="1538" /> positive indications as regards this disease, in particular the fact that the age profile of animals infected with BSE is increasing. Fewer animals under five years of age are being detected and in 1999 none of the infected animals was less than four years of age. This would suggest that provided we continue to rigorously apply our comprehensive controls, the level of confirmed cases of the disease may have peaked.</P>
    <P>The recently published report of the scientific advisory committee on BSE established by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in 1996 acknowledged the comprehensive regulatory system in place to control the spread of BSE and ultimately to eliminate it from the Irish cattle population. The committee found these comprehensive measures, which go beyond those recommended at international level, to be satisfactory and recommended that they be kept under constant review and updated where necessary. This is done by my Department as a matter of course. In addition, these controls are audited on an on-going basis by the food and veterinary office of the EU Commission which has found them to be generally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The newly developed cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, system is already capable of tracing animals and pinpointing animal location with a high degree of accuracy and has been used to good effect to locate the birth cohorts and the progeny of BSE animals. Currently there are more than 40 million individual events recorded on the database regarding animal births and animal locations. The further development of the system will in due course fill in any remaining information gaps about animal movements, thus providing a comprehensive record of Irish cattle from birth to slaughter.</P>

      <P>Ireland's specified risk material, SRM, removal policy is in line with the Community wide policy set down in Commission decision 97/534/EC. While the implementation of this decision has not, as yet, been agreed by member states, Ireland unilaterally introduced these SRM rules in February 1997 in the diseases of animals (BSE) (specified risk material) order, 1997 (S.I. No. 80 of 1997). The list of SRMs is kept under constant review with particular regard to the scientific proposals and recommendations at EU level. Ireland last amended its list of SRMs in 1998.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the implementation of SRM rules in the slaughter plants under my control and that they meet the required standard. The SRM provisions in these plants are audited by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and also by the EU to ensure compliance.</P>

      <P>To be eligible for aid under the scheme of installation aid, an applicant must be deemed to have at least one man work <Col N="1542" /> unit on the date of set up in farming or within two years of that date. Land farmed must be either owned or leased for a minimum period of five years from the date of set up. Where an applicant farms land on any other basis, a<i> pro rata </i>reduction is made in determining the man work unit number.</P>
      <P>In this case, while certain lands were farmed by the applicant, these lands were neither owned nor leased by him. Consequently, the reduction calculation came into play in the determination of the man work units and resulted in the application being ineligible for aid.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the difficult circumstances, the terms and conditions of this co-funded scheme are based on EU legislation, are very specific in regard to requirements and have no provision for discretion.</P>

      <P>The deadline for the completion of the Leader II programme has been extended to 31 December 2000 where requested by individual groups.</P>
      <P>With regard to Leader+ which will operate for the period 2000-2006, the European Commission is finalising the draft guidelines consequent on the recent acceptance by the member states of the European Parliament amendments. It is expected that the finalised guidelines will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the commission seeking approval to commence the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. Over a number of months, the commission will subject these programmes to scrutiny to ensure that they meet the requisite standard for approval.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ and the Leader mainstream programme under the national development plan, it is not possible to anticipate the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the commission's intention is that funding for Leader+ will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of the operational programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes. It is clear that the efforts and work done by the local action groups under the Leader I and Leader II programmes has significantly benefited local communities. I acknowledge especially the contribution made by many individuals on a voluntary basis. The earliest commencement of the two new Leader measures is receiving full attention in my Department.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): A condition for eligibility under the livestock headage schemes is that an applicant must have submitted a valid area aid application form for the relevant year. An area aid application was received from the person concerned after the closing date and consequently a 100% penalty was applied. However, a request in February 2000 to have the case considered as <i>force majeure</i> on medical grounds was accepted. Arrangements are now being made with the local livestock office to issue the outstanding headage payments. Payments should issue within the next three weeks.</P>

      <P>Under the Dúchas compensation scheme for ewes culled under the 1998 ewe supplementary measure the rates of payment were fixed at £11 for the loss of each headage grant under the 1999 sheep headage scheme, £25 for the loss of each premium under the 1999 ewe premium scheme and £2 for each ewe culled.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records for the 1999 schemes the person named was at no loss of sheep headage grants, he was at the loss of 196 ewe premia for which he received £25 each. He also received £2 for each of the 198 ewes that he culled in 1998. Therefore, the payment of £5,296 which he received was his full entitlement under the scheme.</P>

      <P>A contract has been placed for the provision of temporary accommodation at Ballyfermot Garda station and this work will be completed by end of April 2000. The gardaí will then occupy this accommodation permitting the main redevelopment work to commence immediately thereafter. The existing Garda station comprises a single storey block facing onto Rossmore Avenue with two rear wings. The redevelopment work comprises the construction of a new floor on top of the front block and the complete refurbishment of the ground floor. A new public entrance onto Rossmore Avenue will be formed. Additional out-buildings to the rear of the site will be provided and the car parking facilities and landscaping will be upgraded. The main redevelopment works are due to start at the beginning of May 2000 and the contract period is one year.</P>

      <P>The information society action plan, January 1999, paragraph 40, sets out the policy in this area, &ldquo;New material will be made available electronically via websites at the same time as it is provided by more traditional means&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All Departments maintain active websites which are updated on a regular basis. All departmental websites give prominence to the publications available on-line. In line with Government policy an increasing volume of information is being published on-line which includes publications, information leaflets etc. that are available to the public as well as press releases and other information that would not be available to the public in traditional form.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the policy outlined in the action plan was strengthened with the publication in November 1999 of web publication guidelines. The guidelines recommended that &ldquo;All departmental and public sector publications which are publicly available shall be published on the organisation's website, either before, or at the same time as being published by traditional means&rdquo;. In line with this objective, official publications are increasingly being published on-line. Ensuring that on-line publication increasingly becomes the norm is also an objective of the webmaster network in promoting the implementation of those guidelines. The following are the relevant addresses:</P>

      <P>The new home carer's allowance is a £3,000 income tax allowance at the standard rate of tax for married couples where one spouse works in the home to care for children, the aged and incapacitated persons. The allowance may be claimed only by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax and where one spouse, the &lsquo;home carer', cares for one or more dependent persons. A dependent person is a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid &ndash; this includes all children under 16 and children in full-time education under 19, or an elderly person aged 65 or over or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.</P>
      <P>The new allowance was brought in in the context of the changes to single and married persons income tax bands in the budget. As the Deputy will be aware, couples who are not married are not eligible for married treatment under the income tax code. They are also not eligible for the new allowance and I have no plans to change the allowance in this way.</P>

      <P>The following table sets out by Department the number of principal and assistant principal officers on the higher scale.</P>
      <P>The principal higher scale and assistant principal higher scale are separate grades from the standard grades of the same name. Posts are graded at the higher levels where management deems that the scope and quality of the duties and responsibilities involved are greater than applies in the case of the standard grades.</P>
      <P>Appointment to the higher grades is by way of promotion either within the Departments which have these grades or from an interdepartmental competition. Promotion is on the basis of the best qualified candidate from among those eligible.</P>

      <P>The principal standard scale Civil Service promotion competition announced in Department of Finance circular 23/99 took place in late 1999 and early 2000. The information on the competition sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table. In summary the position is as follows.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,131 civil servants, mainly in the assistant principal standard scale grade, were eligible to enter the competition. Some 453 of these officers actually entered the competition and 426 of these candidates in turn attended the initial interview stage within their own departments. This internal departmental interview stage resulted in 124 candidates being nominated for the second interview stage of the competition, which was the preliminary Civil Service Commission interview stage. Arising from this second interview stage, 45 candidates were selected to go forward to the third and final interview stage of the competition which was also run by the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <P>Under section 3 of the Appropriation Act, 1999, a sum of £132 million will be made available to my Department by means of an appropriation-in-aid to the Department's Vote. This provision means that the total estimated revenue to be raised from the increase in tobacco excise will go directly to the health services to address the health consequences of tobacco use.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £12 million has been made available in 2000 to fund the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy. The full implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy will cost upwards of £150 million. A further additional sum of £785,000 has been made available in the current year for tobacco control initiatives. Additional revenue of £3.6 million has also been made available to facilitate the commissioning of new cardiac treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>The above sums are in addition to the existing amounts spent within the health services on the treatment of diseases of the heart and circulatory system, tobacco control and health promotion initiatives targeted at smokers. The treatment of other tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer and respiratory illnesses, also places considerable costs on the health service. For example, under the national cancer strategy a sum of £40 million has been spent on the development of cancer services between 1997 and 2000. In the current year the tobacco revenues available to my Department will assist in providing for further investment in cancer services, £8.3 million extra, breast screening, £2.4 million extra, palliative care, £3.3 million extra and cervical screening, £3.6 million extra. Capital costs associated with the development of the services mentioned above will also be met.</P>
      <P>Finally, an important health consideration in the increase in tobacco excise is the objective of deterring smoking, particularly among young people who are not already committed smokers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>The regulation of cosmetic surgery is not provided for by law and there is, therefore, no legislative framework within which I, as Minister for Health and Children, could issue guidelines on the matter which would be binding on the parties involved. The Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Doctors are required to be registered with the council before they can practice medicine in Ireland. However, practitioners are free to provide services to the public as long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners.</P>
      <P>Doctors practising in the public health service are registered with the Medical Council. People who avail of health services outside of the public health system should endeavour to seek the services of reputable organisations. In cases where people are dissatisfied with the service provided, redress can be sought through civil law.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep this area under review.</P>

The board has advised that it has a number of priorities for 2000 in relation to the provision of services for older people in Waterford in accordance with the board's policy document, Towards the Golden Years, 1998-2011. These include the following: the continued upgrading of St. Joseph's Hospital, Dungarvan, through the commissioning of St. Enda's Ward; the completion of the refurbishment of St. Malachy's Ward in St. Patrick's Hospital, in conjunction with the Friends of St. Patrick's.</P>
      <P>The board further advises that arising from the increase in medical admissions to Waterford Regional Hospital, the majority or which are older persons, an additional 18 bed medical unit was opened on a temporary basis at Waterford Regional Hospital in January last.

The Act also provides that a marriage solemnised between persons either of whom is under 18 years of age shall not be valid in law unless a court exemption from this provision has been granted. It is the responsibility of both parties to the marriage to ensure compliance with the Family Law Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy highlighted a number of issues in relation to the health of young people in the Eastern Health Board area ranging from substance use to physical activity and oral health. The health promotion unit of my Department has developed a number of initiatives aimed at schoolgoing children in a range of settings and covering a range of topics.</P>
      <P>The general health and physical well-being of children is promoted through programmes such as social, personal and health education in schools and being well in the community.</P>
      <P>Smoking, alcohol misuse and substance use are addressed in the school, community and youth group setting through the substance abuse prevention programme; regional programmes such as smokebusters and the teaching everyone about cancer and health &ndash; TEACH &ndash; programme; the youth work support pack for dealing with the drugs issue; knowledge is power; drink awareness for everyone; drugs questions, local answers and the family, communication and self-esteem programme. Regional drugs co-ordinators have also been put in place within each health board with the specific task of leading out on a multisectoral approach to tackling the drugs issue on a more localised basis.</P>

This does not mean that each organ has to be cremated separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>National policy on the treatment of alcohol abuse, as set out in Planning for the Future, stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community based intervention rather than on specialist in-patient treatment. Health boards already provide and continue to develop a range of comprehensive community based support services appropriate to the needs of persons affected and afflicted by alcohol abuse. These services include family support and community, medical and social services in the management of the problem. The main therapeutic tools in the treatment of alcohol dependence are psychotherapy, counselling, family and marital therapy, either individually or in group settings. Therapy may take place in a residential or a day setting. As alcohol related problems occur, in many instances, in local and family settings, the community based response can be direct and early, thereby reducing the associated levels of physical, psychological and social problems.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures in relation to the activities of the Irish psychiatric service indicate that 5,250 acute admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units in 1997 were attributed to alcoholic disorders, accounting for 20% of all acute admissions. However, as already indicated, much of the service provision in this area is community based and the type of data requested by the Deputy, relating to the number of families affected by alcohol abuse, are not available.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, gives powers to health boards to ensure proper standards in relation to nursing homes. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be adequate and suitable accommodation, food and care for dependent persons while being maintained in nursing homes.

      <P>It is normal practice that when new units are completed under major developments such as have taken place under phases I and II of the redevelopment of Limerick Regional Hospital, they are commissioned on a phased basis as the additional revenue funding required becomes available. In 1998, £550,000 was provided by my Department to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of <Col N="1598" /> the commissioning of the new units which were completed in Limerick Regional Hospital and an additional £2.5 million and £4.15 million was provided for this purpose in 1999 and 2000, respectively. This funding has enabled the commissioning to date of a number of units at the hospital, including the accident and emergency department, out-patients department, laboratory and physiotherapy departments, main operating theatres, day, trauma and eye theatres, intensive care unit beds, renal dialysis stations, radiology rooms and CSSD.</P>
      <P>Further commissioning is provided for in the board's 2000 service plan in line with available funding this year, including the opening of the paediatric department at the hospital.</P>

I have been advised by the board that its services are organised on the basis of community care areas. These areas are determined on the basis of population, need, availability of services, access, etc.</P>
      <P>The board further advises that the area of north-east County Waterford to which the Deputy refers is in the community care area of Tipperary South Riding and, as such, access is provided to all services in this catchment area.</P>

In the meantime Westmeath County Council has submitted an assessment of needs for capital water and sewerage works but has not prioritised individual schemes as required. The Mullingar sewerage improvement scheme is included in the list of schemes proposed by the Council. This list will be taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme for this and future years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 but without the benefit of the council having identified its priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Implementation and management of the shared ownership scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for each relevant housing authority. In operating the scheme, local authorities should have regard to local circumstances and maximum price limits or other details are best determined by the local authority. I would not, therefore, regard differences in the operation of the scheme between one authority and another as anomalies. In this particular case, I understand that Fingal County Council made a policy decision to limit the cost of shared ownership properties to £90,000, with a view to limiting as far as possible, house price increases.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I might also add that the council is currently building a number of houses directly which it envisages will be completed within this price limit, a number of which will be offered for sale under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
      <P>The application of the shared ownership scheme to the purchase of apartments is also a matter for decision by the housing authority concerned. I understand that, following detailed consideration of the issue, Fingal County Council decided that, at this stage, the operation of the scheme in respect of apartments was not a feasible option due to the additional legal and other difficulties such as lease agreements, management contracts and charges, including maintenance and future refurbishment cost which have previously been identified in this area.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 217 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>Contract meter readers engaged by the ESB have been considered to be self-employed persons for social insurance purposes for over 30 years. The insurability of such workers has been examined on various occasions in the intervening years and successive decisions by deciding officers of the Department and, where appropriate, by appeals officers of the social welfare appeals office have maintained this position. Accordingly, contract meter readers pay PRSI as self-employed persons, PRSI class S. As the insurability of such contract meter readers has clearly been established over the years, the issue of reclassification for PRSI purposes does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB Meter Readers Association, which has been in contact with the Department, has been advised that if it wished to have the social insurance position of meter readers re-examined, it should submit a number of test cases to scope section in the Department for formal decisions on the matter. The association undertook to submit a number of test cases to both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department seeking formal decisions on the income tax and PRSI position of <Col N="1610" /> such contract meter readers. No such test cases have been received to date by the Department.</P>

      <P>My Department has since 1996 operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, I have allocated a sum of £5 million for this scheme again in 2000.</P>
      <P>I propose to have advertised the scheme in both the national and provincial press by the end of March, at which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding. The allocation of £5 million for this year is based on expenditure incurred in previous years. I am satisfied that the allocation is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 219 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel on a range of services provided by the CIE group of companies as well as on the services provided by over 70 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas.</P>
      <P>My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, a fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department was undertaken to assess whether the objectives of these schemes were being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This included an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target groups and the scope for alternative policy arrangements. The issue of extending the free travel scheme to cover taxi journeys is examined in the review which is now being finalised.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the review cover the following issues. What are the objectives of the free schemes? Is there a rationale for public expenditure on these schemes? Has each scheme achieved its objective in an efficient manner? What are the customers' views of each scheme? Is there a rationale for extending these schemes? What are the costs and payment arrangements for the services provided under the schemes? Is there scope for alternative operational arrangements?</P>
      <P>The review was carried out by an official of my Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It involved a series of meetings held with the free schemes service providers, the staff of my Department, other Departments and agencies and a wide variety of voluntary groups, interest groups and private individuals. The report is due to be published by the Policy Institute in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series later this month.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the review findings, I announced two specific measures in budget 2000. These are the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition, and the extension of the free electricity allowance and free television licence to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000 at an estimated full year cost of £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will consider further measures when I exam<Col N="1612" /> ine the final report in the context of future budgetary policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. At the end of February 2000, there were 14,949 carer's allowances in payment. This represents an increase of more than 60% in the number of carers claiming the allowance since this Government took office. Expenditure on carer's allowance was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115% since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have estimated this figure to be around 100,000 carers, it is not clear that all of these are full-time carers. Based on work in the review, the current figure is estimated to be around 50,000 people covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I announced in budget 2000 the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme which recognises that leaving employment to provide care is a contingency broadly similar to other contingencies under the social insurance code and, as such, the benefit will fill a gap in the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>The new carer's benefit scheme is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. The carer's benefit scheme will come into effect from October this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building further on measures I introduced in previous budgets, I also extended the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes to all carers in receipt of a carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. These extensions ensure that carers will qualify for all free schemes from October. In addition, I have made provision for an increase <Col N="1613" /> in the amount of the annual respite care grant for qualified carers from £200 to £300.</P>
    <P>The extensive measures that I have introduced in recent budgets to benefit carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers.</P>

      <P>The Department is generally recognised as one of the leading users of information technology in Ireland. Successful use of technology is central to the secure and efficient delivery of services and payments to customers. To ensure continued success, the Department must work closely with its technology suppliers to ensure that maximum benefit is gained from its investments in this area. It must continuously assess new products to determine how technology will be deployed in the medium to long-term in order to meet business requirements. This process requires,<i> inter alia,</i> that pre-release, or &ldquo;beta&rdquo;, versions of products are evaluated &ndash; a practice that is widespread within the IT industry.</P>
      <P>The advertisement in question was one of a series featuring different organisations that were investigating the product in its pre-release form. The Department's interest in the product relates to its possibilities in relation to improving the security of client data and in the context of technologies such as smart cards and digital certificates. The Department was not asked to endorse the product but simply to state why it was investigating it.</P>

      <P>Details of allocations to the Heritage Council for the period 1996-2000 are as follows: 1996, £2,200,000; 1997, £3,501,000, including a supplementary estimate of £509,000 in December 1997 to clear outstanding grants; 1998, £4,000,000; 1999, £5,080,000; 2000, £5,740,000.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Heritage Council was established as a statutory, independent body under the terms of the Heritage Act, 1995, when it replaced the non-statutory National Heritage Council. The allocation to the National Heritage Council in 1995 was £1,800,000.</P>
      <P>While I recognise that additional funding could be used to good effect by the Heritage Council in carrying out its statutory functions, the annual funding provided to the council has increased by 92% since I came to office in June 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, I recently announced a special once-off allocation of £750,000 towards the restoration of Ballyfin House, which will be administered by the Heritage Council.

      <P>I thank the Deputy for forwarding the information in question to me which I referred to the heritage service, Dúchas, of my Department for investigation. Regrettably, this information has done little to shed further light on the exact whereabouts of the cillín at Ballyduff Beg.</P>
      <P>A senior archaeologist from the heritage service visited the site at Inagh on Friday, 5 November 1999. He confirmed that the suspected cillín, which had been archaeologically tested previously, is not a burial ground. However, impenetrable coniferous plantation rendered further investigation of the wider area impossible. In the light of the additional information supplied by the Deputy, I took the view that further investigation was required, and on 3 February 2000, an archaeologist who undertakes field survey work for my Department and is proficient in identifying such sites, carried out an extensive search of the Ballyduff Beg. His report cannot confirm the whereabouts of a cillín at Ballyduff Beg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that a systematic check of the area could only be effectively carried out after all trees had been carefully felled and the undergrowth removed, and even then such a check might not be conclusive. A system of follow-up test excavation of selected sites could then be employed <Col N="1616" /> but, in the absence of any hard evidence or scientific data, this would be problematic.</P>
    <P>It would be in the best interests of the developer to carry out a further appraisal of the archaeological potential of the site when it has been cleared of trees, and before a final decision is made as to whether to proceed with the project.</P>
    <P>Should the project proceed, the position is that, as with similar large-scale land development projects, it is standard procedure for my Department to require that archaeological monitoring of all soil stripping work is carried out at the developer's expense. If any archaeological artefacts are uncovered during the soil-stripping works, the archaeologist on site will be in a position to take appropriate action, which might include excavation or preservation <i>in situ,</i> the effect of which would be to limit or prevent developments at the site.</P>

      <P>Due to a severe shortage of accommodation in Dublin, asylum seekers are bein settled at various locations around the country. A number of these have been provided with full board accommodation and, consequently, are in receipt of reduced allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme.</P>
      <P>While I have no immediate plans to introduce a voucher system for asylum seekers, I am keeping the matter under review in the light of the number of new arrivals and the limited availability of suitable accommodation.</P>

      <P>Indictable crime statistics can be found in the annual reports of An Garda Síochana, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details the crime statistics for 1998. While Garda crime statistics for 1999 and 2000 have not yet been formally published, I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January to 3 March this year, ten murders have been recorded. This compares with six during the same period the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 57 armed robberies have been recorded so far this year, as compared to 24 for the same <Col N="1620" /> period last year. I should stress that these figures are provisional and are liable to change.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements for the investigation of murder and manslaughter cases is satisfactory and I am informed by the Garda authorities that all such crimes are investigated to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>While it is of no consolation to the families of those who have died in violent circumstances, the House will be interested to know that the murder rate is among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to armed robberies, the available statistics indicate a strong and sustained decrease in armed crime in recent years, with the level of armed crime for 1998 approximately 40% of the 1995 value. The statistics also show that the detection rate has also risen from 28% in 1995 to 40% in 1998. Naturally, I am concerned about armed crime, but the most recent statistics available indicate that present levels are still well below that of 1995 or 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is responsible for co-ordinating child care service delivery over the course of the national development plan, 2000 to 2006. A number of structures are being established at national and local levels including an interdepartmental &ldquo;synergies&rdquo; committee which is chaired by my Department to focus on co-operation and co-ordination between Departments and State agencies with a role in child care, and a national co-ordinating child care committee chaired by my Department to oversee the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country. The committee has met on three occasions to date; county child care committees to advance child care service provision at local levels.</P>
      <P>The county child care committees will link into the national co-ordinating child care committee on local child care needs and activities. The national co-ordinating child care committee is currently drawing up the guidelines for the operation of the county child care committees.</P>
      <P>The health boards will be responsible for ensuring that the county child care committees are established. My Department has initiated a series of briefing sessions with the health boards in this regard. The process of developing the practical steps for this is under way. The committees will be subject to the guidelines drawn up by the national co-ordinating child care committee, which is chaired by my Department. Membership will be dictated by the local situation and it is expected that the social partners will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> It is intended that the committees should comprise a wide representation of child care interests in the relevant county. The membership might include the health board, local authority, social partners, VEC, FÁS or local employment service, area partnership, National Voluntary Childcare Organisation, a representative of community groups active in the development of child care in the area, a representative of child care providers, community and private, a representative of parents and any other membership considered desirable.</P>
    <P>The tasks being assigned to the county child care committees are as follows: development of a co-ordinated approach to child care provision in the area over the next seven years; development of a local child care information strategy; development of quality statements and targets for the county; identification of local black spots in the provision of child care and proposals for alleviating the position; promotion of the establishment of new child care facilities; identification of priority objectives for the county; liaising with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with the national co-ordinating child care committee regarding local developments; development of local and county wide networks of child care providers; and assessing needs and proposing initiatives that might be specific to that county.</P>
    <P>It is intended that where county child care committees are in place they will be consulted about funding applications for the relevant county this year. I envisage that the roles of the national and local structures involved will evolve over time. It is my belief that the role of the county child care committees will prove to be pivotal in the context of local needs-led planning involving consultation and participative planning of all the stakeholders in relation to a co-ordinated approach to child care provision at both local and national level. The establishment of the county child care committees is expected to progress throughout the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 and 241 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted,<i> ex-gratia</i> compensation may be paid to an injured person where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence. The scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. The tribunal is an independent body and I have no function in the settlement of individual claims for compensation.</P>
      <P>However, I have had inquiries made with the tribunal about this case and have been informed that on 19 May 1997 the then secretary of the tribunal wrote to the applicant's solicitor informing them that an award had been made by a single member of the tribunal. I have been further informed that the applicant did not appeal the award, accepting it on 15 November 1999. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that any question of a review of the award would be a matter solely for the tribunal.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question of interest on the award, I understand that the chairman of the tribunal has decided that interest will not be payable and that a letter, including a payable order in the sum of the award, outlining the decision will issue to the applicant's solicitor in the next number of days.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy applied for asylum in June 1997. This application was refused in October 1998 and his subsequent appeal was also turned down. The Government decision allowing asylum seekers to work applied specifically to individuals who had been in the State for a minimum period of one year up to July 1999 and whose asylum case was ongoing. As the person referred to was no longer in the asylum system &ndash; his application had been refused after appeal and notification of such refusal was issued in May 1999 &ndash; he was not entitled to take up employment under this decision. I should mention at this point that there is no record on the case file of the person referred to that he was a qualified carpenter or that he provided translation services for voluntary services dealing with refugees and asylum seekers in Wexford.</P>
      <P>There is no record on the applicant's file of either he or his legal representative having been informed of failure to respond to correspondence. The applicant's file indicates that he, his legal representative and my Department were in regular contact form the initial stages of his asylum application in 1997 up to the present time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the case of the individual referred to in the question was dealt with fairly at all stages of the asylum process.</P>
      <P>I have considered this case under the provisions of section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, and have decided that this is an appropriate case where the person referred to should be repatriated. I do not consider the information in the Deputy's question sufficient to warrant a different conclusion. I understand that arrangements have been put in place and that the person referred to is due to be removed from the State today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information provided in response to Parliamentary Question No. 329 indicated that 1,541 applications were abandoned in respect of applications lodged in the period 1996 to 1999. These applications were deemed abandoned as a result of ongoing co-operation between my Department, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards. This liaison between our Departments will address this issue to minimise the risk of abuse of the welfare system without being unfair to any genuine applicant. Paragraph 20 of the procedures for processing asylum claims in Ireland, which have been notified to the UNHCR, states:</P>
      <P>where an applicant fails to attend at an interview or is otherwise uncontactable without good and sufficient reason his or her case will be considered to be abandoned. A notice to this effect will be sent to the applicant at his or her last known address by registered post. If the applicant subsequently comes to the attention of the authorities he or she will be considered to be an illegal immigrant and will be dealt with in accordance with immigration (non-asylum) rules.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which the applications in question were deemed abandoned were as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1. Where applicants for refugee status failed to attend for a scheduled interview following the issue of a letter by registered post. In the event of failure to attend for interview inquiries are made with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to ensure that the notification of interview dates issued to the address at which the applicant is currently in payment or the last known address. A letter then issues to the relevant address informing applicants that consideration is being given to deeming their application abandoned and informing them that if within 14 days of the date of this letter they do not inform the Department in writing of the reasons why their application should not be deemed abandoned then their application will <Col N="1627" /> be abandoned. If there is no reply a registered letter is sent to them informing them that their application has been deemed abandoned. In the event that the Eastern Regional Health Authority has a more recent address than that supplied by the applicant to this Department a second interview letter is arranged prior to any action being taken in relation to abandonment.</P>
    <P>2. Where applicants were handed the notification of their interview date at the counter in the Refugee Applications Centre or in a dispersed location. This letter contains a paragraph which specifically states that failure to respond to the letter within 14 days or failure to attend at interview without good and sufficient cause will result in consideration being given to deeming the application abandoned. If applicants fail to attend for interview without giving a good reason a registered letter deeming their application abandoned is issued.</P>
    <P>3. Where applicants failed to renew their asylum seeker card. A notice of intention to abandon is sent by registered post to their last known address. If there is no reply to this notice within 14 days a registered letter is issued informing the applicant that the application has been deemed abandoned.</P>

      <P>To co-ordinate the management of this scheme a coastal watch co-ordinator has been appointed in the relevant areas. These co-ordinators are members of the Garda Síochána at the rank of inspector and are instrumental in cultivating contact with the following key members of the public: residents along the coast; farmers with land on the coast; island dwellers; local fishermen; members of local boat clubs; harbour masters; postmen; hotel, guest house, caravan and holiday home staff; lifeboat personnel, lifeguards, cliff/sea rescue personnel; beachcombers; rig workers; and wildlife rangers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously stated in this House, I am firmly of the view that the most effective way to tackle the scourge of joyriding is through a co-ordinated response at local level by a range of Government agencies. My Department is to the fore in such initiatives through its involvement in the integrated services process. For this reason, I warmly support the development of the community development programme, which is under the aegis of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I am confident that, in conjunction with other area-based initiatives, the community development programme will make a significant contribution to addressing the many problems faced by our most deprived communities, including that of joyriding.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of the programme, gardaí have worked closely with community development programme staff. A good example of this co-operation is that both agencies assisted in the establishment of the Wooddale Garda youth diversion project, which is funded by my Department. I am assured by the Garda authorities that this scheme has been a success in diverting young people from involvement in criminal behaviour, such as joyriding, to other more worthwhile pursuits, such as participation in youth groups.</P>
      <P>Both the gardaí and the local community development programme representatives are actively involved in the anti-joyriding task force in Coolock. I understand that this group is currently examining a diversion programme for young people as an alternative to joyriding, and representatives from the Wooddale project and the gardaí are involved in this task. I have asked the Garda authorities to keep me informed of developments in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The small claims procedure is a special mechanism for dealing with consumer claims within the District Court structure which is designed to handle such claims speedily, inexpensively and informally without involving a solicitor. It is administered by the small claims registrar whose function it is to process the claims and, if possible, reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing. Should this prove unsuccessful the claim will go before the District Court judge. The small claims procedure was initially introduced on a pilot basis in 1991 and was extended nationwide in 1993 following on from the success of the pilot scheme. The current fee payable for using the procedure is £6 and the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure is £1,000.</P>
      <P>To avail of the procedure a person must have bought goods or services for private use from someone selling them in the course of business. For example, claims may be made for bad workmanship or faulty goods but not for debts or personal injuries. When the scheme was extended in 1993, the non-return of rent deposits and minor damage to private property were brought within the scope of the procedure.</P>
      <P>In 1998, 343 decrees were issued by the District Court to the various sheriffs. Some 157 decrees were returned unenforced,<i>&ldquo;nulla bona&rdquo;</i> by the sheriffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The execution of all court orders is a matter for the sheriff in accordance with the provisions of <Col N="1631" /> the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended. Sheriffs are independent in the exercise of their functions and are answerable only to the court and I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that indictable crime statistics can be found in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details the crime statistics for 1998. The annual reports of the Garda Síochána detail crimes reported on a national, regional and divisional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can further inform the Deputy that while provisional Garda crime statistics for 1999 have not yet been formally published on a divisional basis by the Garda authorities, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the national figure is <Col N="1632" /> 81,500 approximately indictable offences, which represents a 5% decrease over the previous year, and a cumulative decrease of about 21% since 1997.</P>
    <P>As the Garda crime statistics are provisional, I cannot comment on specific issues, although I assure the Deputy that never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, for purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, never in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those guilty of serious offences serve their sentences.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that indictable crime statistics can be found in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details the crime statistics for 1998. While Garda crime statistics for 1999 have not yet been formally published, I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 1998, 38 murders were recorded. I am further informed that provisional figures for 1999 also indicate that 38 murders were recorded, 31 of which were detected. The number of murders recorded over the past two years is in fact lower than the number which were recorded in 1996 and 1995, which was 43 and 42, respectively.</P>
      <P>In 1999, nine cases of manslaughter were recorded, compared with 13 cases of manslaughter in 1998. These figures compare to a total of 16 which were recorded in 1997. Again, I should stress that the statistics for 1999 are provisional and are subject to change.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements for the investigation of murder and manslaughter cases is satisfactory and I am informed by the Garda authorities that all such crimes are investigated to a conclusion. While it is of no consolation to the families of those who have died in violent circumstances, the House will be interested to know that the murder rate is among the lowest in Europe.</P>

      <P>The statistics compiled for the annual reports of An Garda Síochána do not give a breakdown of offences committed by what are regarded as organised criminal groups. <Col N="1633" /> However, I do not accept that there has been an increase in organised crime in recent times. For example, in relation to one area sometimes associated with organised criminals, the number of armed robberies decreased by more than 20% between 1995 and 1999.</P>
      <P>In fact, the last few years has seen a major crackdown on organised crime. Legislation specifically designed to target organised crime has been introduced: the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced while in Opposition; the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996; the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and other Purposes Act, 1996; and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996; the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which I introduced before the House.</P>
      <P>Specialised Garda units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation have been established, again, to combat organised crime.</P>
      <P>Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 1999, the bureau has obtained section 2 interim orders on property to a total value of over £7.6 million and section 3 interlocutory orders on property to a total value of over £5.4 million, under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded almost £33 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity and social welfare determinations and savings amounted to over £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>In 1998 and 1999 seizures of illicit drugs amounted to an estimated street value of over £120 million and the money laundering investigation unit of An Garda Síochána received over 2,500 suspicious transaction reports with a value of over £200 million.</P>
      <P>These measures have been recognised as a major step forward in the fight against organised crime and have resulted in the dismantling of major organised crime gangs and a high percentage of persons being prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to prison.</P>
      <P>With regard to violent crime in particular, the Deputy is well aware that the use of violence and intimidation by criminals is not a new phenomenon and in cases where the victims are also involved in crime there can be major difficulties involved in investigating the crime.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned the legislation introduced in recent years to combat organised crime and the establishment of specialised Garda units. In addition, I have introduced a witness security programme which has been used successfully to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that our legislation is among the most effective in Europe when it comes to combating organised crime. However, that is not to say that there is any complacency on my behalf. In this context, I am constantly evaluating our response to organised crime and I assure the Deputy that <Col N="1634" /> whatever steps are necessary will be taken to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to recent violent incidents and he has informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards these areas of criminal activity and that a continued proactive and integrated approach is taken by the gardaí to the investigation of cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of organised criminals. He has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and bring those involved to justice.</P>

      <P>The Courts Service was established in November last year and has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of all courthouses throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Courts Service that they are preparing a five to seven year capital building programme at present. In this programme, priority will be given to those areas where buildings are in greatest use, have high caseloads and where there are a high number of court sittings. For example, the county towns have been accorded priority because they usually accommodate court staff and sittings in the District, Circuit and High Courts. As the Deputy will be aware, Naas courthouse has been fully refurbished and extended and refurbishment work is about to commence on Athy courthouse which is a District and Circuit Court venue.</P>
      <P>Kilcock courthouse is a District Court venue which sits two days per month. I am aware that the facilities in Kilcock are inadequate to meet modern day court requirements. I have been informed by the Courts Service that it is their intention to improve the facilities on the existing site or to provide modern courts facilities in another location in the town as part of the Courts Service capital building programme. However, given the overall demands on the programme it is not possible at this point to say when work will commence in Kilcock.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána has pri<Col N="1635" /> mary responsibility for the apprehension and arrest of persons suspected of smuggling or the illegal importation of controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>The Customs and Excise service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled into the State by sea and air.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that surveillance to combat international drug smuggling is carried out as follows: by air &ndash; the Garda air support unit supplemented by the Air Corps; by sea &ndash; the Naval Service is utilised for intercepting suspect vessels; by land &ndash; conducted by the Garda national surveillance unit which is recognised internationally as a highly professional operational unit.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have Customs and Excise officers strategically located at all major ports and airports and at various coastal locations. They also have five maritime units within the Customs national drugs team &ndash; CNDT &ndash; based in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Sligo. These officers attached to the maritime units are also engaged in servicing the Customs drug watch programme. This initiative which was launched in 1994 actively promotes the involvement of seafarers, aerodrome personnel and persons resident in coastal communities, in assisting the CNDT in identifying suspect craft which may be engaged in drug smuggling.</P>
      <P>A coastal watch scheme is also in place along our coastline and involves: educating the public in relation to the possibility of drug traffickers importing drugs along the coastline, ensuring that information is recorded and channelled efficiently and ensuring that intelligence reports are utilised to the full.</P>
      <P>To co-ordinate the management of this scheme a coastal watch co-ordinator has been appointed in the relevant areas. These co-ordinators are members of the Garda Síochána at the rank of inspector and are instrumental in cultivating contact with the following key members of the public: residents along the coast; farmers with land on the coast; island dwellers; local fishermen; members of local boat clubs; harbour masters; postmen; hotel, guest house, caravan and holiday home staff; lifeboat personnel, lifeguards, cliff/sea rescue personnel; beachcombers; rig workers; and wildlife rangers.</P>
      <P>Given the length and nature of our coastline the difficulties involved in surveillance are obvious and it would be impossible to have blanket coverage.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am informed by the Garda authorities that due to the excellent working relationships which exist between the relevant agencies involved in air, sea and land surveillance, they are satisfied that the services currently in place are quite adequate to deal with this problem.</P>

    <P>When I took office there were about 2,700 applications in the system, many of which were outstanding for three years without any consideration of the application. At 29 February 2000 there were 10,810 applications at various stages of processing in the system.</P>
    <P>As refugees are persons who are recognised on completion of the asylum process the question of the number awaiting a decision on their claim does not arise.</P>
    <P>All applicants who lodged a claim for asylum up to the end of March-April 1999 have at this time been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview with some minor exceptions. In view of the progress to date on backlog processing, the recent advice from the Attorney General with regard to the better use of accelerated procedures and the increase in numbers since the second half of 1999, arrangements have now been put in place whereby 75% of those scheduled for interview will be persons who arrived one/two months previously and 25% will be scheduled from the backlog. All decisions at first instance are notified to applicants within three months following interview.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are now in place to enable greater use to be made of accelerated procedures to deal with cases speedily which are manifestly well founded and manifestly unfounded. Manifestly well-founded cases will be identified at an early stage to ensure that a person who is likely to succeed in the asylum process gets the benefit <Col N="1637" /> of refugee status as soon as possible. Manifestly unfounded procedures will help to eliminate at an early stage applications which appear to have little or no relevance to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. Applicants refused as manifestly unfounded have the opportunity to appeal to the independent appeal authorities with legal assistance for that purpose. All manifestly unfounded refusals are notified to the UNHCR which is entitled to submit comments to the appeal authority in each case. Staff have completed workshops on the application of accelerated procedures.</P>
    <P>The current average period for an individual determination of an asylum claim averages from four to 12 months. The waiting time at appeal ranges from less than three months for manifestly unfounded cases, which are considered on the papers submitted, up to 12 months for appeal hearings.</P>
    <P>There are now six independent appeals authorities appointed to consider appeals. I am making arrangements to appoint further appeals authorities to create a wider panel to deal with the increasing number of appeals.</P>
    <P>The aim of my Department is to minimise the time taken from date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards. With this in mind on foot of the Government decision of 3 November 1999, on 25 November 1999 the Department of Finance approved the appointment of 42 additional staff to the Refugee Applications Centre. The recruitment process is well in train and the 21 staff appointed to date are currently undergoing appropriate training. The bulk of the 42 staff will be assigned to interviewing applicants at first stage and the remainder will be allocated to processing appeal of refusals at first instance. It is envisaged that the remaining staff will be in place by end of April 2000.</P>

    <P>The case raised by the Deputy involves two agencies under the aegis of my Department, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations <Col N="1638" /> and the Courts Service. I understand that the matter is now being considered by the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
    <P>As equality officers are independent in the performance of their functions under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, it would not be appropriate for me to inquire into any case which may or may not be under investigation by an equality officer. Furthermore, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which came into force on 18 October 1998 and replaces the 1977 Act, provides that the Director of Equality Investigations, equality mediation officers and equality officers shall be independent in the performance of their functions.</P>

      <P>Under the URBAN Programme 1996-1999, a community initiative of the European Commission, assistance was made available for integrated development programmes for a limited number of geographically-defined, deprived urban areas throughout the EU. The programme had total funding of approximately £21 million of which the EU element was £15 million over the period 1996-99.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the areas that benefited from the operational programme for URBAN were north Dublin &ndash; Ballymun, Finglas and Darndale; south Dublin &ndash; west Tallaght and north Clondalkin; and northside of Cork city.</P>
      <P>Financial support was provided for pilot programmes-actions that were demonstrable in nature and where promoters could confirm that they would become sustainable after 31 December 1999. The question of continuing funding for the projects included in the 1996-99 URBAN 1 action plans does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>Ireland, supported by Portugal and Italy, and the European Parliament, succeeded in convincing the EU to have a new URBAN Initiative in the post-1999 period. The EU has allocated a community wide budget of 700 million euros to the URBAN II Community Initiative for the period 2000 to 2006. The European Commission is currently finalising the guidelines for URBAN II. Ireland has been given an indicative allocation of 5 million, IR £3.9 million, of Structural Funds for one URBAN area. The selection of this area will be in line with the guidelines.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that about 10% of Irish pupils at primary level have serious literacy problems. Pupils have learning difficulties for a variety of reasons arising from factors in the pupil's home, school environment, or from ability factors. Other pupil factors involved in literacy problems consist of language difficulties, perceptual problems, poor phonological awareness, memory deficits and emotional factors. It is recognised that a small percentage of pupils among those with serious literacy problems have a specific reading disability or dyslexia.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated 1,465 learning support teachers at primary level to support pupils with learning difficulties, including those with dyslexia. Where dyslexia is suspected, assessment by a psychologist is required. Pupils diagnosed with severe dyslexia receive more focused support in special schools and special classes established for them and from resource teachers allocated to mainstream schools. It is the function of remedial and resource teachers to diagnose the exact nature of each child's learning difficulty, and in conjunction with class teachers to plan and teach an appropriate remedial programme.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the present practice of identification and diagnosis of literacy difficulties by pupils, teachers and by psychologists assigned to schools, is the most effective way of ensuring timely and appropriate interventions for pupils with literacy difficulties, including those with dyslexia. I am not aware that undetected dyslexia is a major factor.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; will be organised in ten regions, corresponding to the health board regions. As soon as new psychologists are in post, the first priority will be to fill those vacancies caused by resignations and career breaks. After that, assignment of psychologists will be made in the most transparent and fair way possible.</P>
      <P>The overall allocation of psychologists to the regions will be largely based on the projected student numbers in each. In the interests of equity, it is proposed that each cohort of psychologists will be shared among the regions on a <i>pro rata </i>basis, until each region has reached its target staffing quota.</P>
      <P>Within each region, priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county, currently being undertaken by the NEPS psychologists. Among other things, they are looking at evidence of disadvantage, incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services. Letters and submissions on behalf of particular schools and areas that have been sent to NEPS will be included in the survey as evidence of need. The local availability of facilities for psychologists carrying out assessments will also be considered.</P>
      <P>I hope that, in the near future, NEPS will be able to present a draft &ldquo;roll-out&rdquo; plan to the National Policy Advisory Board. All the main client groups and other providers of psychological services are represented on the board and will therefore be able to contribute to the discussions on the draft plan.</P>

      <P>There are currently 43 educational psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; agency of my Department. I am aware that this number does not meet the demand for these services. However, improvement and expansion of the service offered by NEPS will begin when additional psychologists are in place. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has now completed the process of selecting additional suitably qualified psychologists, who will take up their <Col N="1648" /> posts in two stages. It is hoped that the first group will begin to take up their posts during the current school term.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that, by the end of the year 2000, nearly 100 psychologists will be in post. This is half the eventual target of 200 psychologists, who should be in post by the end of the development phase of NEPS (end of 2004). Nonetheless, once the numbers currently being recruited are in post, there should be a marked improvement in the level of service being offered by NEPS across the country.</P>

      <P>I have asked my officials to examine, in consultation with interested parties, the feasibility and practicality of establishing a science centre. In this regard the possibility of a virtual centre would fall to be considered.</P>
      <P>This issue highlights the need to continue to boost an interest in the sciences in schools. A significant development planned to take place over the next five years will be the implementation of a new science programme in the primary schools.</P>
      <P>In the revised curriculum, science holds equal standing with history and geography for all classes and is to be given an appropriate time allocation. The implementation of the revised curriculum will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers and a new grants scheme for the teaching of science in primary schools.</P>

    <P>At second level concerns have been expressed about the uptake of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate. A number of measures have been initiated in response to these concerns, which involve the modernisation of school laboratories, the revision of different science syllabi and the provision of extensive training for teachers. In <Col N="1650" /> addition, a <i>per capita</i> grant has been introduced in respect of students studying physics and chemistry at leaving certificate for the purchase of appropriate materials. The clear aim is that these initiatives will help students to develop an interest in the sciences and to be aware of the future opportunities that will be available for them through the use of science.</P>
