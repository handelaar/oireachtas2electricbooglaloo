      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I attended the UN millennium summit in New York on 6-8 September 2000. The overall theme of the summit, which was attended by more than 160 world leaders, was &ldquo;The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century&rdquo;. I was accompanied to the summit by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my address during the opening session of the summit, a copy of which I have laid before the House, I took the opportunity to restate Ireland's traditional commitment to the values and ideals of the United Nations and to highlight the need for action if the UN is to achieve its fundamental task of dealing with war and want throughout the world. I placed particular emphasis on the responsibilities of the more affluent societies among the international community to assist in achieving these objectives. I was proud, therefore, to announce to the summit the Government's decision to commit to attaining the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for development aid. We have adopted an interim target of 0.45% by the end of <Col N="987" /> 2002, and we will reach the UN target by the end of 2007. In the course of my address, I was also pleased to have the opportunity to publicly signal Ireland's support for Secretary General Annan's proposals for reform and renewal of the UN and its institutions. I was proud, therefore, to announce to the summit the Government's decision to commit to attaining the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for development aid. We have adopted an interim target of 0.45% by the end of 2002 and we will reach the UN target by the end of 2007. In the course of my address I was pleased to signal Ireland's support for Secretary General Annan's proposals for reform and renewal of the UN and its institutions.</P>
    <P>I participated in a round table discussion on the role of the UN in the 21st century. This was the first time such an interactive forum was held at a UN summit and a report on the proceedings is being prepared for Secretary General Annan.</P>
    <P>My attendance at the summit afforded a unique opportunity to meet leaders from a number of countries with whom we have long-standing and friendly relations. In addition to meetings with President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair, I also met formally with the Presidents of Albania, Colombia, Georgia, Hungary, Micronesia, Nigeria, Romania, Slovakia, Tunisia, Costa Rica and Kiribati and the Prime Ministers of Ethiopia, New Zealand, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Tuvalu and Vanuatu and Crown Prince Moulay Rashid of Morocco. In these meetings I discussed matters of mutual economic and political interest as well as the Secretary General's proposals for UN reform and, of course, Ireland's SECCO campaign. I was particularly pleased to exchange letters establishing diplomatic relations with the leaders of Tuvalu and Kiribati in the course of our meetings.</P>
    <P>I sent a message to President Clinton in advance of his visit to Colombia in August indicating our concerns at the situation in the area of La Union. During my meeting in New York with President Pastrana of Colombia, I emphasised our deep concern about the situation in his country and the absolute need to ensure that everything possible is being done to ensure the safety of Fr. Brendan Forde and the villagers of La Union. I am aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs dealt with this topic comprehensively in the House at Question Time last week.</P>
    <P>During the millennium summit I also met the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and was pleased to sign the Declaration on Racism, A Vision for the 21st Century. This declaration, which was prepared by the Commissioner, will significantly assist in generating a positive approach by countries to the world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which will take place in South Africa next year.</P>
    <P>Prior to the summit, Secretary General Annan had requested member states to use the occasion to sign and ratify a number of UN conventions. I was pleased to avail of the opportunity of my <Col N="988" /> attendance to sign and ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to sign the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child &ndash; the first concerns the involvement of children in armed conflicts and the second concerns the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</P>
    <P>In addition to my formal meetings, I attended a reception hosted jointly by the Presidents of the General Assembly, Mr. Holkeri and Mr. Ben-Gurirab, as well as a reception for visiting leaders hosted by President Clinton. I was pleased to accept an invitation to address the World Leadership Forum organised by the Foreign Policy Association of New York. My speech to the forum on the subject of Ireland in the wider world has been laid before the House. In my address to the forum, which was attended by senior figures from the business and academic community, I outlined the development of Irish foreign policy, our continuing commitment to the UN ideals of peaceful resolution of conflict and co-operation among nations. I also highlighted our readiness to assume an increasingly active role in international affairs as exemplified by our campaign for election to the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>I am delighted, therefore, that our campaign has had such a successful conclusion. To be elected by such a margin, and on the first count, illustrates the high regard in which our contribution to the work of the UN is held throughout the world. Our success is a significant achievement and is a credit to the dedication and professionalism of our political and diplomatic efforts throughout the world. To have succeeded against such formidable opponents with substantial campaign resources is a major achievement especially given our relatively modest campaign budget of little more than £1 million. Of course, the long history of work overseas by Irish religious and NGOs, the outstanding record of our peacekeepers and the principled positions adopted down through the years by successive administrations on international issues, especially as regards human rights, provided the basis upon which our campaign was built.</P>
    <P>I record my congratulations to the other successful candidate from our group, Norway, and the three other new members also elected from the African, Latin American and Asian groups &ndash; Mauritius, Colombia and Singapore, respectively. I have written to the relevant Prime Ministers of each of the successful countries and the President of Colombia.</P>
    <P>I pay particular tribute to the hard work and commitment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, the co-ordinators of our campaign team, Ambassador Mary Whelan in Dublin and Ambassador Richard Ryan in New York, and all the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs who devoted such energy to the campaign <Col N="989" /> over the past two years. I thank all my ministerial colleagues and other Members who took the opportunity of political contacts and parliamentary visits to campaign for election.</P>
    <P>Our election will, of course, necessitate the allocation of additional staff and resources to meet the demands of our membership. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is currently finalising proposals on the revised staffing and resources requirements to meet these demands. I will be fully supporting these proposals when they are brought to Government.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the significant result that the majority of member states have put their faith in our ability to make progress towards achieving the United Nation's fundamental aims of preventing war, promoting human rights and justice and creating a better standard of living around the globe. We will endeavour to further these aims during our time on the council. We will also work towards making the council a more effective and representative instrument of the UN in the modern world by taking an active role in the process of renewal and reform, especially regarding the structure and operation of the council.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to have the opportunity to welcome Her Imperial Highness, Princess Sayako, to Government Buildings on 17 October last during her visit to Ireland. We discussed the positive development of Irish-Japanese relations over the past decade and I informed her of my intention to lead a trade delegation to Japan next year.</P>
    <P>I met President Museveni of Uganda yesterday and today. The President and I discussed a range of matters, including the promotion of economic relations between Ireland and Uganda and the need for better access to world markets for developing countries. The President briefed me on the various conflicts which are under way in his region and the efforts that are being made to resolve them in the context of the Lusaka, in the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Arusha, in the case of Burundi, accords. The President expressed his appreciation of Ireland's development aid programme in Uganda and I assured him of our intention to continue to expand these programmes in partnership with his Government. I was pleased to accept his congratulations on Ireland's election to the UN Security Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that children in Iraq are dying at a rate of 4,000 per month? Is he also aware that Iraq, which had a reasonable health service ten years ago, has virtually no health service now? Is he further aware that people who contract potentially fatal illnesses in Iraq are likely to die because of the lack of medical facilities? Does he realise this is the result of continuing United Nations approved sanctions against Iraq? Why did the Taoiseach not raise the issue of these sanctions, which were requested and are supported by the US, in his speech to the Foreign Policy Association of New <Col N="990" /> York, during which he made liberal references to other world conflicts? Did he raise the ongoing brutal sanctions against the people of Iraq during his visit to the United Nations and, if not, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise that matter in my speech because I was allocated only five minutes to speak at the UN meeting. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised it both in the House and at various meetings around the world during the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach be instructing the Irish representative on the Security Council to, in all instances, cast Ireland's vote against the continuance of sanctions against Iraq? What will the Irish Government, during its membership of the UN Security Council, be able to do about the illicit trade in arms, particularly in view of the fact that Kalashnikov assault rifles can be bought in Croatia for as little as $30 and that this is being done by so-called Irish republicans who are intent on using such weapons to kill Irish people? It is obvious that the facility to which I refer is also being used by individuals in other countries. What practical measures does the Taoiseach intend to take during Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council to staunch this trade in arms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first matter to which the Deputy referred, we will be obliged to set out our position in respect of all the major issues before the Security Council. Our position on most of these issues has been well aired in the past but we now have an opportunity to reiterate them at a different forum. As stated on previous occasions, it is arguable whether, in many cases, the embargoes brought to bear on countries such as Iraq have any effect other than to cause suffering on the part of those people who they are in some way meant to protect.</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern about the easy availability of arms by different devices and at low prices throughout the world. I have expressed this concern in speeches at the United Nations and elsewhere. Agents and groups are involved in the supply of these arms. I raised this matter again last week. It will be part of our campaign at the Security Council to highlight the sources for the small arms industry. There appears to be a reluctance to trace the source of this trade. The matter was discussed at the ASSEM 111 summit at the weekend but questions about the source of small arms are generally met with a stony silence. The small arms industry presents a major difficulty in several countries. We can use our voice in the Security Council to deal with it.</P>
      <P>People here have been raising the issue of the small arms industry for 25 years but the question of the location of the industry continues to be met with silence. Many arms are sourced in eastern Europe. The problem does not lie in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="991" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that certain sections of the United States political establishment have a fixation with economic sanctions? Does he agree that the experience of economic sanctions against Cuba has proved that the only effect of economic sanctions on a country is to solidify the ruling regime while impoverishing and in some cases killing the people over whom it is exercising tyranny? Does he consider it time to make it clear that Ireland is opposed to US sanctions against Cuba and UN sanctions against Iraq and believes economic sanctions are not an appropriate means of achieving a political resolution to most issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases sanctions work against the majority of the population and do not resolve the issue. However the matter is not confined to the United States. The imposition of sanctions is one of the nine principal objectives and functions of the United Nations Security Council. It has always been a main theme through the standing committees and <i>ad hoc </i>committees. There is a standing sanctions committee for almost all of the areas mentioned by Deputy Bruton. Down through the years the UN has established standing committees to deal with these issues. I do not disagree with Deputy Bruton. In most cases sanctions continue for many years but the regimes against which they are imposed do not change while the sanctions damage the resident population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton has said, in many cases sanctions solidify dictatorial leaders in power.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned to the Foreign Policy Association that he is in favour of the extension of the Security Council to 25 members and the elimination of the veto. How realistic are these objectives? Is it a primary objective during Ireland's term of membership to achieve those two objectives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The realistic assessment is that we should support Kofi Annan. In his document of last April he set out clearly the deficiencies of the Security Council and how he believes it can be made a more credible and efficient organisation. If I was asked which blueprint I would follow, I would support his initiatives, one of which I have picked. This is more realistic. There are countries which are of the view that they should be permanent members. This is not realistic and they will not receive support for this position. Our proposal is more likely to gain acceptability. While I am not tied to it, I am tied to the view that Kofi Annan should receive support. Based on his presentation to the United Nations Security Council and his blueprint presented last Easter, it is essential that there is reform to ensure the problems of the world can be dealt with more effectively by the organisation. We could support any of the five systems recommended by him.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would be supportive of Kofi Annan's approach, that is not the specific question I put to the Taoiseach. How realistic are these proposals? More importantly, is it to be a principal objective of our two year term on the Security Council to have a reform programme implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>While it should not dominate our agenda, given the effort Kofi Annan has put in in the past two years to achieve reform, if it is rejected, it is unlikely the position will change. Our priority should be to address the main functions and powers laid down under the charter of maintaining international peace and security in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations, to investigate any disputes or situations which may result in international friction, to recommend methods of adjudicating in such disputes in terms of settlement, to formulate plans for the establishment of a threat to peace or aggression and recommend what action should be taken. Given the effort put in to the reform package by Kofi Annan, each Commissioner and unit of the United Nations, it will be very disappointing if it is ignored. While many countries have adopted a hard position, the considered position of the Secretary General should not be ignored. We are supportive of his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that in his address to the United Nations on 6 September he made such a major point of the rededication of Ireland to meet the United Nations ODA target of 0.7% by 2007 and the interim target of half this figure by the end of 2002, will the Taoiseach reconsider whether this target should be revisited in the light of our success in winning a seat on the United Nations Security Council and the substantially increased revenue generated for the State? Will he be prepared to increase substantially overseas development assistance in the Estimates for the coming year and, in particular, if part of the reluctance to increase it is due to administrative bottlenecks in his Department and recipient Government agencies, to increase dramatically the allocations to NGOs such as GOAL, Concern and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in recent years increased ODA enormously. This is recognised and appreciated all over the world. Its focus is understood and accepted far better outside the country than within. It is a well organised programme, which does an excellent job. To reach the interim target of 0.45% by the end of 2002, the figure has to be increased substantially this year, and it will. On the question of administrative bottlenecks, because the figures have been rising rapidly we have to extend and expand the programmes in place. A complete review is taking place, as reported here last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who stated what they <Col N="993" /> will do over the next few weeks to complete the review. That must happen given the additional resources if we are to continue our excellent aid programmes, both directly through the UN, through NGOs and in the context of priority countries such as Uganda, Lesotho and others. I do not think it is bottlenecked. We have driven forward very quickly and our figures have increased, not only because the proportion has increased but because of economic growth, and I hope Ireland Aid can maintain its reputation. It must expand its development work and we hope to have the blueprint completed before Christmas as the Ministers outlined here last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the interim, assuming the report will recommend additional staff allocations, the shortage of staff throughout the Civil Service will prevent effective delivery of the additional resources?

As the Deputy is aware, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get Irish staff for programmes, even for Irish programmes. This does not take one iota from the fact that the staff are excellent and that they commit themselves to give a number of years in such work. We commend the staff regardless of from where they come. I have talked to NGOs and am certainly supportive of their work. They do an excellent job in the field.</P>

        <b>:</b> In his address to the UN summit, the Taoiseach referred to horrifying levels of poverty, affecting billions of people, and to disarmament. Why did he not spell out the link between the two and the fact that the massive amounts of money spent on armaments annually is directly responsible for the poverty and hunger of billions of people? Why did he not also point out that in 1997, world expenditure on arms amounted to $156 billion of which the US, Britain and France alone expended a massive $129 billion, and that many of the armaments were sold to shady regimes around the world? Why did he not openly challenge these states, who pride themselves on being models of democracy, to change that policy, to beat swords into ploughshares and to turn high-tech weapons, produced with billions of US dollars, to high-tech devices that could help to feed the hungry and the poor he spoke about, thereby eliminating the disease and horror that afflicts them?</P>
      <P>When he met President Clinton, President Chirac and Mr. Blair at the glittering galas and various diplomatic occasions did the Taoiseach look them in the eye and tell them they were responsible for peddling the weapons of mass destruction on a world-wide basis, weapons that finish up on both sides of the same conflict?</P>

      <P>The Deputy read my speech and it would be fair of him to acknowledge, as would any reading of the speech, that in a short time I made a case about how poverty can be assisted. I did not make it in the US. I met representatives from many countries whose budgets have been used against rather than for the poor on expenditure in wars. Today I heard the President of Uganda speak about the 800,000 people who had been killed in the period before he had taken over to try to establish democracy. The same themes run through all of these countries. Resources are spent on weaponry rather than the ordinary people. The World Bank and the IMF continually point this out. Former Ministers for Finance will have heard the case made against these countries at the World Bank.</P>

    <P>I argued for the policies of peace keeping, disarmament and development for the less well off. A huge proportion of people live on under $1 per day. I have also spelt out that this country stands for human rights and humanitarian action. An enormous number of people live on less than a dollar a day. This country stands for human rights and humanitarian action. This small country gets so much support because that is recognised throughout the world. We are in the new agenda under which the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, made efforts to deal with the issues of disarmament and his campaign is being followed <Col N="996" /> on now in non-proliferation policies. Our democratic system follows the fundamental rules of human rights, the dignity of the person and disarmament and is against the proliferation of weapons. These are issues for which we have stood since the foundation of the State, and for which we will continue to stand.</P>

Is he aware that this convention has not come into force because not enough countries have been able to ratify it and that Ireland is one of the countries which is holding up the establishment of this court by its failure to ratify? If one is promoting human rights internationally, what does the Taoiseach intend to do about that in view of the importance of having sanctions against those who breach them? In the same regard, has the Taoiseach had any conversations with United States representatives to establish the reason that country has refused to support the establishment of an international criminal court and why a country which is looking to try war criminals in other countries refuses to sign up to the jurisdiction of this court and to put its own military under the jurisdiction of the court?

      <P>The Deputy should table a question to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding his point about the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke to President Pastrana I raised all the cases. We had a long discussion about Fr. Brendan Forde. His family had briefed me as they had direct contact with my Department. He had also sent briefing material back to me which I used for my meeting with President Pastrana. Since my meeting with President Pastrana our ambassador based in Mexico city visited Bogota to present his credentials. At that stage President Pastrana confirmed to Ambassador Agnew that there was an investigation into the events of La Union and what happened on 8 July by the <Col N="999" /> offices of the Attorney General and the state prosecutor. The ambassador was advised that additional security measures requested by the peace community in La Union were also in hand.</P>
    <P>Nobody said to me and it was not my information that those involved were state soldiers. This is the first time anyone has said to me what Deputy Joe Higgins has just said. I hope it is not true because the response we got was that the president would discharge 400 of his army personnel to the region to try to improve the situation there. I know he has done that. The Deputy stated that he believes the paramilitary group involved was aligned with the state forces. That does not fit in with what I was told.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Quinn's point about Fr. Brendan Forde, we will continue to follow that matter. It is his wish to stay there and complete his work. It is not a question that he wants to move away. I made that clear to President Pastrana. He left and went back to show his dedication and commitment to the people of La Union.</P>
    <P>I was saddened to hear of the brutal abduction and killing of Tristan James and Javier Nova. When I met President Pastrana he emphasised his determination to do his utmost to bring an end to the violence and restore the rule of law in his country. I raised the cases of Tristan James and Tristan Garcia, both of whom were killed during the summer, as I was asked to do by their families. I also raised the events in La Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>As I previously stated in the House, the recent publication of the final report by the air accident investigations unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident in Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999, in which four members of the Air Corps &ndash; captain David O'Flaherty, captain Michael Baker, sergeant Paddy Mooney and corporal Niall Byrne &ndash; were tragically killed, evoked many sad memories for the families of the victims, the Defence Forces and the public in general. Once again, I pay a most sincere tribute to those brave men who gave their lives in the service of others.</P>
      <P>The report is a very comprehensive and detailed document and I welcome its publication. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the circumstances and cause, or causes, of the accident to prevent future such accidents. It was not the purpose of the accident investigation nor the investigation report to apportion blame or liability. I urge Deputy Finucane to study the report in its entirety. The report outlines the extensive preparations which were undertaken by all concerned to provide the 24-hour search and rescue service at Waterford airport.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suitability of the Dauphin helicopter for search and rescue missions, all helicopters operate within certain ranges. The Dauphin is a multi-engined, all-weather, light load carrying helicopter, equipped with auto hover and with a declared maximum operating range of 150 nautical miles by day at a speed of 135 knots and 70 nautical miles by night at a speed of 135 knots. These are the ranges and, by extension, the limitations within which the aircraft must operate. While the report refers to the shortcomings of the Dauphin as a search and rescue platform in the north-western theatre, as expressed to the investigation by past and present search and rescue practitioners, no case in relation to any such shortcomings was made to my Department. The report recommends that the general officer commanding the Air Corps should review the matter.</P>
      <P>All the safety recommendations set out in the report which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation. A number of recommendations which call for action by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources are being closely examined in that Department. A safety recommendation in relation to potential hazards to rescuers associated with sites of serious aircraft accidents is a matter for a number of Departments and agencies.</P>

      <Col N="1001" /> I have put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. In this regard, an initial meeting of a working group was held in the Department of Defence on 5 October 2000 involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces, and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. This group will meet on a regular basis to ensure the speedy implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report. Progress reports from the various bodies involved will be presented and reviewed, following which composite progress reports will be presented to me at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Action has begun to implement the recommendation that the Department of Defence should commission, on behalf of the Air Corps, an independent air operations safety audit by an agency with a proven track record of expertise in military aviation. In this regard, my Department has asked the Department of Public Enterprise for advice regarding the sourcing of appropriate expertise to carry out the recommended air operations safety audit. I have directed that this audit be carried out at the earliest time possible. All support necessary will be provided by my Department and the Defence Forces to the chosen agency to carry out its work. In addition, as recommended in the report, an Air Corps air safety office is being established with immediate effect and an air safety officer has been appointed by the general officer commanding the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>At the time of the tragedy the Minister was out of the country. I have read the report not once but three times. I regret that the first words of the Minister, on behalf of the Departments of Defence and of the Marine and Natural Resources, should have been an apology to the families of those four people who tragically lost their lives.</P>
      <P>On the day of the launch of the 24 hour service, his colleague, the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, described it as a world class service &ndash; that was reported in a newspaper.</P>

      <P>Why, on the first day of the 24 hour operation at Waterford Airport on 1 July 1999, did Air Corps personnel go to that airport for the first time? It was the first time a technician, who was a member of that group, was at that airport and when he arrived, he was asked to take control of the manning of the air traffic control tower because over 12 meetings over a year the Department of Defence could not get its act together regarding putting the safety infrastructure in place. It is a shocking commentary on both the Department of Defence and Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <P>In fairness, a Cheann Comhairle, give us that much latitude to try and get this thing sorted out once and for all. What the Minister is saying is that the facilities were not available on the particular night. Now the onus of responsibility is being shifted to the captain of this flight and the three officers with him. This situation evolved because the Minister's Department decided to put this helicopter into that area. Therefore, the responsibility to ensure the back-up services which are needed to run this service are in place lies totally with the Minister's Department. One cannot get away from that, irrespective of what the Minister says, that is, that the captain in charge is responsible for safety on the particular day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that completely. As the Deputy knows, the earlier decision was to put that service into operation some months sooner. It was because there was not agreement on meeting the type of conditions which the Air Corps would require to establish this service that it was deferred. It was only when the airport manager wrote to our Department indicating that all these conditions had been put in place and when the Air Corps, having examined that, was satisfied with the conditions and informed the marine emergency services, that the service could proceed on 1 July.</P>
      <P>This was not a decision for my Department or a particular Minister, it was a decision for the technical experts who manage and run this emergency service on behalf of the people. It was not my decision. I do not have the technical capacity or responsibility to do that. I respect the decisions that are taken by the experts. The airport manager's letter&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of enlisting non-nationals in the Defence Forces is not a new one.

The general secretary of PDFORRA, addressing the conference, called on the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to initiate immediate discussions with all interested parties, with a view to inviting and attracting non-nationals to join the Defence Forces in return for an accelerated entitlement to citizenship. The general secretary when speaking on the motion also indicated that he wished the issues raised to be considered with a view to presenting details of any scheme to next years conference for approval.</P>
      <P>In looking at this issue, it goes without saying that Irish society has to become far more open and inclusive. There are many existing rules, attitudes and assumptions which will have to be challenged as part of this process. In that context, it is opportune that we review the criteria for enlistment in the Defence Forces. I will approach the review with a completely open mind, concerned only to ensure that whatever rules need to be applied will reflect the realities of the 21st century. However, I would caution that the existing rigorous selection procedure and security clearance requirements will always be applied.</P>
      <P>The question of entitlement to citizenship is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Officials from my Department will work with the military authorities and with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other interested parties to review the current criteria in relation to enlistment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply in this case. I was at the PDFORRA conference when this call was made and I see the Chief of Staff had no objections. The Minister would probably need to accelerate recruitment of non-nationals because up to the end of September, nearly 650 people have left the forces. In many cases, the best technical and engineering people are leaving because the Celtic tiger is proving to be an enemy of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given this year's recruitment target of 750 and that up to the end of September 390 people have been recruited, how does the Minister expect to achieve his target? The Mini<Col N="1008" /> ster should accelerate the employment of non-nationals and enlisting them into the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave a commitment in the programme for Government that more than 1,500 recruits would be taken into the Defence Forces and we have exceeded that. At the same time, the Deputy is right in that the buoyancy in the economy and the opportunity for alternative employment is hitting us and, indeed, many areas of the public service and the private sector. That, in itself, is a great thing for the country, that is, that there are so many jobs and that the unemployment rate is so low. It is something for which we all worked and welcome very much.</P>
      <P>I cannot be certain that we will reach our full target. We relaunched the recruitment programme recently and we hope that with the in-take of applications, we can move very close to reaching our target by the end of the year. If not, we will look at alternative ways because we need young people coming in as they are the life blood of the forces of the future. The percentage of young people serving in the Defence Forces at home and overseas is now at a higher level than ever before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>On becoming Minister for Defence, it became apparent to me at an early stage that the changing nature of peace support operations required that we significantly upgrade the protection available to our troops when on UN missions abroad. The APC programme is a major step in bridging the gap in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with all tender competitions organised by my Department, the competition for the <Col N="1009" /> procurement of armoured personnel carriers was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, the objective of which is the achievement of the highest standards of impartiality, objectivity and transparency. Tenderers were afforded equal opportunity in their submissions and in providing such further information as was necessary to ensure that their proposals were fully presented to the Department.</P>
    <P>More than 30 prospective suppliers world-wide had expressed interest in the APC procurement programme and proposals were received from 12 companies. The proposals were evaluated and assessed by a civilian-military project team which was established to manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money was obtained for the expenditure involved. Two vehicles were selected to go forward to the final stage of the tender competition having complied fully with the initial technical specification. The successful proposals were submitted by Mowag of Switzerland which manufactures the Piranha APC and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria which manufactures the Pandur APC. The vehicles proposed by the other ten firms failed to comply with one or more of a range of essential elements of the specification and the firms were notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>Both companies were asked to prepare formal tenders on the basis of a detailed specification. These tenders were evaluated to determine technical merit and the best economic advantage to the Department of Defence. The evaluation process included trials in Ireland, over a two month period, of both vehicles. Following the completion of the technical assessment I authorised the opening of negotiations between the Department and Mowag with a view to concluding a contract between both sides.</P>
    <P>The negotiations proved successful and a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of 40 APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The first two vehicles will be produced towards the end of this year and will undergo rigorous inspection and acceptance testing. The full production run will commence in June 2001 and I am delighted to say that all of the vehicles will have been delivered by January 2002 &ndash; almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
    <P>No consideration was given by my Department to any joint venture contract for the provision of the APCs. I have outlined for the Deputy the detailed tendering procedure which took place. The lengthy competitive process resulted in the selection of Mowag to provide the APC most suitable to the needs of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Although it was not a requirement of the tender competition Mowag, on signing the contract, committed themselves to an offset arrangement whereby the company would endeavour to source parts which might be purchased from Irish industry. The offset volume represents approximately 20% of the contract value. Mowag is in continuous contact with Enterprise Ireland in this matter.</P>
    <P>Representatives of Mowag have compiled a shopping list and have visited companies in Ireland to establish contacts to find out if their products could assist in any way in the build of the Irish APCs. The process is ongoing. Any decisions taken in that regard are a matter for Mowag and not the Department. My Department would, of course, welcome any positive decisions taken by Mowag to source parts from Ireland and will be monitoring the progress of the offset programme as the contract develops. I am delighted with the progress made on the APC programme. The purchase of the APCs forms an integral part of the ongoing re-equipment programme. The imminent arrival of the vehicles is a great boost for the Defence Forces as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mowag entered into discussions with an Irish company in regard to assembling the armoured vehicles in Ireland? Mowag went back on it and stated to the Irish company that the Army had indicated it was not interested in a local off-set, only wanted Irish content and was very insistent on that. Is the Minister aware of who, within the Department of Defence, would have stated that to Mowag because this Irish company felt it had entered into a good arrangement with Mowag to assemble armoured vehicles in Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a particular Irish company which was involved at the initial stages and tendered for the APC competition subsequently withdrew its bid and now appears to have at least an understanding on its side that it had an agreement with Mowag. This is primarily a matter between the two companies. In the negotiations with Mowag, we had fairly serious discussions on offsetting investments which would be made here. I understand it has been in touch with Enterprise Ireland and a number of companies in regard to supplying parts for the APCs. However, the primary matter the Deputy has raised is not really for me. It is a matter between the two companies concerned.</P>

      <P>The last thing the Deputy and I would want to do would be to discuss a £40 million contract for 40 armoured personnel carriers, which we need, on the basis of rumour and hearsay about who said what. This programme was conducted in an exemplary, transparent and open <Col N="1011" /> way. We dealt, in the final analysis, only with people who met the specifications in full. They were put through a rigorous examination on every front, so that we would get the best value for money for the Irish taxpayer and have facilities for the Army which it never had before.</P>

I presume, based on that letter which was sent on 3 October, the Minister has done research to establish whether this was said or not. This is not rumour or speculation on my part but is based on a factual statement the company made in a letter to the Minister, a copy of which it sent me.</P>

      <P>The Department's lands at Oranmore are the primary range and training area for military personnel of the Western Brigade and are in constant use throughout the year.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a new training area to accommodate the range and mobility which the training of mechanised troops require will be considered by my Department in the coming months. This consideration will include the possible relocation from Oranmore which may allow for the disposal of these lands for economic development.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Department of Defence owns 535 acres in Oranmore, which has been meeting our rifle range and training requirements for a considerable time. This issue arose because of some outside interest in the land, which is owned by the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>The military authorities are establishing a working group to look at alternative sites, which the Deputy will appreciate are not easy to find and would require very extensive examination, subsequent planning permission and so on. As far as I know, no specific area has been identified yet. I understand it is extremely difficult to do so. However, the west is being looked at very specifically to find land to accommodate the Defence Forces' future requirements, in the event of the disposal of Oranmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information, with which I am familiar. No progress has been made, therefore. Does the Minister consider that locking up land for that use within close proximity of the ever expanding city of Galway is the best use for that land? If the Department of Defence succeeds in getting similar grounds somewhere else in, as the Minister said, the west &ndash; where there is plenty of open spaces &ndash; would the land at Oranmore be then made available to the proposers of the airport facilities for Galway? I am sure the Minister is aware that Galway Corporation, which owns 80 acres adjacent to this land, has already decided to make its 80 acres available. Does the Minister agree this very valuable land in a vastly expanding area should not be locked up when less valuable land could be used for this purpose? The land is set to farmers for most of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unfortunate comment to describe the land as locked up. This land, which is owned by the Department of Defence, is extensively used as a firing range and training area and we do not have an alternative site within a very long distance from that area. As the Deputy knows, there is a huge number of Army personnel in the west and midlands who use this facility.</P>
      <P>I hope I will be supported by the Deputy if I try to dispose of any lands because I encountered many rows when I disposed of land a couple of years ago. However, I accept we require a larger amount of land for the future and we are looking seriously at that. We would be interested in dealing with the local community to determine its greatest need, including the airport, and the Corporation. We have not come to that stage yet. However, I suggest to the Deputy, as an active member of the local authority in Galway, that we could do with support from the elected members to identify areas which could be used and for which planning permission could be fairly easily obtained.</P>

      <P>Given the role of the Defence Forces, it is inevitable that members of the forces are from time to time involved in inherently hazardous duties. Accordingly, every effort is made by the military authorities to make military training safe and realistic for the tasks and contingencies that military personnel may face from time to time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the military authorities regard health and safety matters within the Defence Forces as a priority issue. The Defence Forces have put a great deal of work into implementing the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and they have demonstrated a high degree of commitment to the safety of personnel. In that context, I am advised by the military authorities that safety statements, which are regularly updated and reviewed, have been in place in all units since October 1991, and safety representatives are in place at unit level throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>A Defence Forces advisory committee on health and safety, comprising both civilian and military personnel, has been engaged in directing and monitoring a comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>As part of the ongoing implementation of safety measures, personnel involved in manual handling are given manual handling instruction on an annual basis. All personnel receive instruction on care of hearing prior to annual range practices.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of how the duties of Defence Forces personnel impact on their health and welfare is carried out at unit level by the unit commander, on an annual basis as part of the annual safety audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps was that one of the more senior positions in Air Corps headquarters should be dedicated full-time to the maintenance of a proactive aviation safety programme, including the monitoring of compliance with such a programme. The general officer com<Col N="1015" /> manding the Air Corps has appointed a senior officer to the appointment of air safety officer on foot of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the protection afforded to members of the Defence Forces under the terms of the Safety, Health and Welfare Act, 1989, and associated regulations is considered satisfactory. The need for constant vigilance in this important area is recognised.</P>

If they are not applied at all times, what is the reason, given the importance the Minister attaches to the appointment of a safety officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of the highest safety standards is clearly a matter of primary importance not just to me but to the military authorities at every level. Adherence to the health and safety legislation of 1989, the various statements and the procedures put in place is exacting. The military authorities assure me they are being put in place at all levels.</P>
      <P>With regard to the earlier question, let us take the Air Corps as an example. People who have constant dealings with the Air Corps will acknowledge that its adherence to and application of safety standards and its management of aircraft and so forth are accepted internationally to be of the highest international standard. I have no doubt that this is the case throughout the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the safety officer appointed to the Air Corps, what staff are involved with the officer and what strength will his decisions have? Will they be sacrosanct? Who is his commanding officer and, in relation to a safety matter, who does he report to or correspond with to ensure the problem is dealt with? What status does the officer have? Does he operate alone or does he have a number of staff? What position does he have in the Air Corps?</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's earlier reply, the report of PDFORRA to its annual general meeting does not agree that the health and safety legislation is being applied. It claims the opposite and that the Department is only going through the motions of applying the Act, that no effort is being made to meet the criteria laid down by that Act and that no training is given to ordinary members of the Defence Forces in relation to implementing the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare Act, 1989, the military authorities have undertaken a major review of this problem and a number of measures have been taken to improve the effectiveness of care of hearing procedures within the Defence Forces. For example, particular emphasis on preventative measures is included in the recruit training syllabus. Appropriate signs are now in position on all firing ranges. I will not go into further detail.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to the military authorities to suggest that senior officers in command are not adhering to the highest safety standards. All the information I have from successive chiefs of staff is to the opposite effect. Young people joining the Defence Forces today can be satisfied that every possible effort is being made in that regard. Any investment that is required and is requested of me will be met as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 206 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>The sale of six barracks identified as surplus to military requirements is being progressed. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth, Clancy Barracks, will be vacated in the near future.</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is in the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped that the formalities of this sale can be completed in the near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council, all for local community purposes. I have recently agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements have commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and it is anticipated that sale contracts will be signed in the near future. Pending completion of the legal and finan<Col N="1019" /> cial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board earlier this year on foot of that agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the aforementioned properties, where sales have been agreed, the sale formalities are in progress and on completion of those formalities the agreed amounts, totalling £8.367 million, will be realised by my Department.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the largest of the barracks concerned, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of this year, for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan, and my officials recently met council officials to discuss various aspects of this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The property will be put on the market following adoption of the integrated plan into the Cork county development plan. A letting arrangement is in place at the former barracks whereby a small area of the property has been made available to facilitate the development of an adjacent site. An agreed fee is payable by the developer of the adjacent site in respect of this arrangement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation for refugees, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, has been used to accommodate Kosovar refugees since May of last year. The barracks is now also providing accommodation for asylum seekers. In view of those needs, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property. However, this matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be vacated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. I expect the sale of the property should proceed in 2001.</P>
    <P>The disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to close any further barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Wall's question, I am anxious to have further discussions with the local community on the sale of Magee Barracks in Kildare. The Deputy put forward an earlier proposal that we could examine the disposal of the majority of the site and still be able to accommodate the Kosovars for whatever length of time that will be necessary. There can be ongoing discussions about that. It is an extremely valuable site that is centrally located. I look forward to being able to deal with it satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>There are no major plans for the expansion of the barracks in Renmore in Galway, given that a considerable part of the new funds that have come into my Department were dedicated to the barracks in Cork and at the Curragh, the two barracks, in the main, designated for receiving numbers following the closure of the other barracks. Such accommodation is involving an extensive programme of building activity which is costing millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Finucane's question, I will revise the estimate upwards when the sale of all the barracks is complete, although I cannot estimate by what amount. The sale of Clancy, Magee and Ballincollig Barracks alone, without the sale of the others, will be more than capable of realising the original amount projected.</P>

    <P>Mr. M. Smith: I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 145 and 146 together.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the final report by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999, in which four members of the Air Corps, Captain David O'Flaherty, Captain Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne, were tragically killed, evoked many sad memories for the families of the victims, for the Defence Forces and for the public in general. I, once again, pay a most sincere tribute to those brave men who gave their lives in the service of others.</P>
    <P>The report is a very comprehensive and detailed document and I welcome its publication. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the circumstances and cause, or causes, of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. It was not the purpose of the accident investigation nor the investigation report to apportion blame or liability.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to the provision of air traffic control services, the position from the outset was that out of hours air traffic control as well as crash rescue services was to be provided by Waterford Airport Company. This matter was the subject of ongoing correspondence and discussion between my Department and the manager of Waterford Airport from early August 1998. The manager of Waterford Airport set out in a letter to the Department of Defence on 7 January 1999 that all conditions, with the exception of the rate of pay, in relation to the provision of after hours <Col N="1022" /> services had been agreed with his employees. It was stated that the employees had agreed to a roster that would provide a 45 minute standby cover for marine emergencies with a crew of three, one tower and two rescue crew, outside current published opening hours. The one outstanding issue at that time was the rate of pay and the manager sought the advice of my Department in this respect in order that he might establish an appropriate rate relative to any other such situations and since the Department would be refunding the costs. Ongoing contact ensued and on 25 June 1999, the Department of Finance sanctioned the public funding necessary to meet the call out allowance being sought by Waterford Airport. This approval was immediately relayed to the manager of Waterford Airport, who indicated that staff negotiations had not yet been completed. However, he reiterated earlier assurances to the Department that after hours cover would in any case be provided by Waterford Airport with effect from 1 July 1999. With regard to the position obtaining in relation to these services on the night of the ill-fated mission, I refer the Deputy to the report where the matter is dealt with in some detail.</P>
    <P>All of the safety recommendations set out in the report which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation. A number of recommendations which call for action by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources are being closely examined in that Department. A safety recommendation in relation to potential hazards to rescuers associated with sites of serious aircraft accidents is a matter for a number of Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>I have put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. In this regard, the initial meeting of a working group was held in the Department of Defence on 5 October 2000, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces, as well as from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. This group will meet on a regular basis to ensure the speedy implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report. Progress reports from the various bodies involved will be presented and reviewed, following which composite progress reports will be presented to me at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Action has begun to implement the recommendation that the Department of Defence should commission, on behalf of the Air Corps, an independent air operations safety audit by an agency with a proven track record of expertise in military aviation. In this regard my Department has asked the Department of Public Enterprise to advise regarding the sourcing of appropriate expertise to carry out the recommended air operations safety audit. I have directed that this audit be carried out at the earliest time possible and all support necessary will be provided by my Depart<Col N="1023" /> ment and the Defence Forces to the chosen agency to carry out its work. In addition, an air safety office in the Air Corps as recommended in the report is being established with immediate effect. An air safety officer has been appointed by the general officer commanding the Air Corps to this position.</P>
    <P>In addition to the air accident unit investigation, following the accident a military court of inquiry was convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the air accident investigation unit and the coroner's report. The military court of inquiry, which was awaiting publication of the final report, assembled at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, on 16 October 2000 and its work will proceed once the coroner's court findings are received &ndash; I understand that the coroner's court is scheduled for today, 24 October 2000. I assure the House that all findings and recommendations of the court of inquiry in question will be fully considered and appropriate action taken as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. This is a serious situation and we are now saying that the manager of Waterford Airport stated that, despite no agreement being in place with the staff, services would be supplied from 1 July. What was to be supplied? Was it a proper facility for the position of air traffic controller or was it what was supplied on this fateful night, a mere technician and the airport manager? If the decision given to the Department at the time was that it was a full service, why was that full service not in operation on the night in question?

      <P>I answered this question earlier. On 7 January 1999 the airport manager wrote to my Department indicating that all the conditions required in terms of equipment, manpower, services and so on were in place, with the exception of the pay agreement for the call out time. Between that and 1 July negotiations continued and that was finally sanctioned and out of the way by 24 June. The decision to operate from 1 July was taken in the full knowledge of all these relevant factors, including the technical expertise in the Air Corps and the airport, and on that basis the service was provided.</P>

      <P>On 25 June 1999 the Air Corps informed my Department that it was in a position to proceed with the service on 1 July 1999. It had to be satisfied with the provisions the airport manager had indicated as being available. As far as I know, there is no question of a doubt about any of these matters.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of what the airport manager might have said, as I did not hear the interview, but the working group was established in December 1997 and its remit included every aspect of a successful launch and operation of a search and rescue. That included all the provisions that would be required to ensure that that operation would be successful and to suggest that air traffic control would be excluded is nonsense.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach also take the opportunity to disassociate all decent minded people in the House from the snide and derogatory remarks made recently by a columnist in a Sunday newspaper? Those comments, in a materialist and barren way, seemed to devalue the achievements of these athletes merely because they cannot compete on the same level as able-bodied people. Surely it is the philosophy of sport that people ultimately compete against themselves and their limitations rather than against some theoretical objective standard laid down by an abstract norm. The achievements of our athletes at the Paralympics, because of the struggle they must make against their limitations to be successful, are as worthy of celebration as those of athletes, whether able-bodied or not, in other sports.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach, through this statement on the Order of Business, allow the <Col N="1027" /> House to congratulate all of our athletes participating in the Paralympics in Sydney, to extend a special message of congratulations to the medal winners and condemn the elitist and social Darwinist observations made by some people in relation to the human spirit?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As predicted by Deputy Bruton, there will be no arguments on this issue. Everyone in the House joins in congratulating all those involved in the Special Olympics which have been a great success. Our athletes have again done remarkably well.</P>
      <P>I am always conscious that people should realise that sporting events, particularly the Olympic Games, are about participation. Whether one comes first or last is irrelevant, it is all about taking part. People involved in competition, be it at the Olympic Games or the Paralympics, like to do their best. At the Paralympics, Catherine Walsh jumped from fifth to third place and won a bronze medal in the women's pentathlon as a result of a personal best run in the 800 metres, Tom Leahy also achieved a personal best in his event and Gabriel Shelley did very well. I take this opportunity to join with Members in congratulating everyone involved.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, who is representing the Government in Sydney to pass on our best wishes to our athletes. I will contact Deputy Ryan again and state that it is the wish of the House to congratulate everyone involved on their efforts.</P>
      <P>Anyone who criticises those taking part in the Paralympics does not understand the effort they invest in their events. Members will, at some stage, have attended the Community Games, in which special events are included, or watched the Dublin marathon, in which wheelchair athletes have put up great performances for over 20 years. Everyone must recognise the amount of effort that people with special needs or disabilities of any kind must invest in their events. In many ways, those taking part in the Paralympics are even more deserving of our praise and thanks than anyone else because they compete against enormous odds.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Bill entitled an Act to promote teaching as a profession; to promote the professional development of teachers; to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State; to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and <Col N="1033" /> training of teachers and other matters relating to teachers and the teaching profession; to pro vide for the registration and regulation of teachers and to enhance professional standards and competence; for those purposes to establish a Council to be known as An Chomhairle Mhúinteoireachta or, in the English language, the Teaching Council; to provide for the repeal of the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1914, and to provide for related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Bill, which is extremely important for teachers, pupils, parents and the country as a whole. Its general aim is to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers, which will include a professional code of conduct. It will provide, in particular, for the establishment of a Teaching Council.</P>
      <P>For our 44,000 teachers the Bill will afford them a significant degree of professional autonomy and self-regulation. It will also enhance the status and morale of the teaching profession and the quality of education provided. For students and their parents, the Bill will provide them with an assurance that the teachers who work with their children meet the highest standards of professional qualification and competence through a professional code of conduct. It will also provide parents with a clear and transparent course of action in the event of a teacher failing to meet these standards. For the country as a whole the Bill will copperfasten the already high standard of education provided, which has been and will continue to be so important to the economic and social development of the State.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done on the establishment of a teaching council in Northern Ireland. The work we will do today will ensure teachers in Ireland, North and South, will move forward together. The establishment of teaching councils in both parts of Ireland will ensure that the high standards of teaching, North and South, of which we are so justly proud, will not only continue, but will be seen to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today marks a significant step towards the establishment of a Teaching Council in Ireland where teachers are among the most highly regarded of the professions. Like all professionals, they know what it is to face change in their lives and work. They know that they must adapt to these changes if they are to continue to provide a first class education for their students. The teaching profession has been to the forefront <Col N="1034" /> of change in education, not only reacting posi- tively to change, but also leading and driving it in all aspects of education.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enhance further the status of teaching as a profession. The Teaching Council will play a central role in ensuring the high standards of teachers, and education will be sustained and strenghtened. The establishment of the council will allow teachers to undertake the functions necessary to ensure quality remains the hallmark of the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>A professional council charged with maintaining and developing standards is a natural part of the maturing of any profession. We already have similar professional bodies in a number of areas, including the Medical Council and the Nursing Board. It is timely that teachers should have their own professional role formally recognised by the State in a Teaching Council. This will confirm the status of teachers, entitle them to regulate their own affairs and empower them with greater responsibility for the standards and quality of education.</P>
    <P>I will go further. The establishment of an autonomous Teaching Council to be the voice of teachers on educational matters and to promote the highest possible standards of practice in our schools is fundamental to the growth and development of the teaching profession. As a means of consolidating past achievements and as a preparation for the challenges of the future, it is timely that a statutory council be established to protect and promote the status of teaching in society and the advancement of the profession.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents the culmination of a process of consultation and deliberation which began two and a half years ago with the establishment of a steering committee in which teachers were centrally involved and which advised the Minister on the establishment of a Teaching Council. The steering committee's report was published in October 1998. The drafting of the Bill was based on its conclusions and recommendations, which were agreed by all involved. The establishment of a Teaching Council has long been advocated in a range of official reports, including the 1991 OECD report, Review of Irish Education, and the 1992 Green Paper, Education for a Changing World.</P>
    <P>Teachers and the other partners in education have long sought the establishment of a Teaching Council. They believe, as I do, that the council will have a major role in recognising the contribution of teachers as professionals who possess the knowledge and expertise not only to shape the future of their profession but also to contribute effectively to the future direction of education policy. The council will be an independent statutory agency which will exercise the powers and perform the functions through which teachers can achieve a large degree of professional autonomy and self-regulation. The council will have a statutory role in the regulation of the teaching profession and the professional affairs of teachers and an advisory role in other matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Section 7 outlines the functions of the Teaching Council, which are to promote teaching as a profession; establish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers; establish and maintain a register of teachers; establish and promote standards in programmes of teacher education and training; promote the continuing education and training and professional development of teachers; conduct inquiries into and, where appropriate, impose sanctions in relation to the fitness to teach of teachers. The council will also conduct or commission research, represent the teaching profession on educational issues and provide advice for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a broad representation of interests on the 37 member Teaching Council. As is the norm in the case of professional bodies, the majority of members will be drawn from the teaching profession and elected by practising teachers. It is important that the council should have access to expertise from areas outside of, but deeply interested in, the teaching profession. The steering committee, which was representative of the partners in education, recommended the composition outlined in the Bill. On its recommendation, the Bill provides for the representation of the teacher training colleges, parents' associations and management bodies on the council. I have also provided for five persons representative of outside interests to be appointed to the council, of which two &ndash; one each &ndash; will be nominated by the ICTU and IBEC. I am confident that the broad-based composition of the council will be an important factor in ensuring widespread support for the work of the council and its overall success in promoting best practice within the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will have much to offer teachers. Working through the council, teachers will play a key part in the self-regulation and development of their profession. Within the framework provided by the council, teachers will be able to address issues of professional autonomy in the context of teaching.</P>
    <P>Teachers' professional status and recognition will be enhanced greatly by many elements of the Bill, in particular the professional code of conduct provided for in section 6. While it will be the responsibility of the Teaching Council to draw up the code, I envisage that it will encompass a statement of professionalism agreed by all teachers. As far as individual teachers are concerned, being part of a recognised, collective professional identity with statutory authority will enhance their individual status and identity. The council will be the voice of teachers in promoting the profession of teaching through a celebration of achievements and raising public awareness of the way teachers work and the environment in which they work. An improved and widely promoted image of the profession will benefit teachers of today and encourage new entrants for the future. The Teaching Council will play an important part also in ensuring the in-career professional develop<Col N="1036" /> ment of teachers remains relevant to their short-term and long-term needs.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will advise the Minister in relation to standards for entry into programmes of teacher education and training, and teacher supply. The council's role will be to ensure the professional needs of teachers and the teaching profession are recognised when policy decisions are taken in these key areas. With the new professional image provided by the Teaching Council, teachers will be better placed to have an input into policy development.</P>
    <P>The role of the Teaching Council in representing teachers is distinct from the role of the teacher unions. While there are many areas of common interest to the Teaching Council and the teacher unions, there is a fundamental difference between their roles. The Teaching Council will be concerned with promoting and maintaining the highest standards within the teaching profession. Negotiations on conditions of service, salaries and pensions will remain the preserve of the teaching unions. There is no contradiction in this arrangement; the work of the two bodies will complement each other.</P>
    <P>In common with most self-regulated professions, the Teaching Council will establish and maintain a register of its members. This is provided for under section 30. The register of teachers will function as the main regulatory instrument of the Teaching Council. It will stand as a verifiable expression of the standard of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence that teachers aspire to have and maintain.</P>
    <P>Section 30 also provides for the Teaching Council to decide the information to be held on the register. This will include specified details for each registered teacher, including the findings of any disciplinary proceedings and the period for which such information will remain on the register. The council will publish the register and make it available for inspection in such form and manner as it considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>To be registered, a teacher must have attained a satisfactory level of professional qualification and training. Thus, the register will effectively act as a statement of the standards required of teachers. Only persons who reach these standards will be able to work as teachers in State funded positions. Following the initial period of registration, teachers will renew their registration annually. As Deputies are aware, there are highly experienced people who have worked for many years in education who are not formally recognised as teachers and who will now be required to comply with the requirement to register under the Bill. The contribution of these people has to be given due recognition and I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to address this issue.</P>
    <P>For parents, the Teaching Council will provide an assurance that teachers who work with their children have been recognised as meeting the highest standards of professional qualification and competence. Where parents have concerns <Col N="1037" /> regarding their children's teacher, there will be a clear and transparent course of action available to them, with procedures to safeguard the rights and duties of all parties, and with appropriate remedies where such are found to be needed. If setting and maintaining standards by the Teaching Council, acting on behalf of the teaching profession, is to have any meaning, then the council must have power to act in the event of a teacher failing, for whatever reason, to reach these standards. Thus, a procedure for dealing with complaints against a teacher is set out in section 40.</P>
    <P>Essentially, two committees will deal with complaints, the investigating committee and the disciplinary committee. These committees will be empowered to investigate and adjudicate on complaints where it is alleged that teachers have failed to meet acceptable standards of practice. The members of the investigating committee and the disciplinary committee will be drawn from the membership of the Teaching Council as laid down in sections 26 and 27. The committees will operate under procedures drawn up by the council. These procedures will be developed to protect the rights of all concerned. In particular, any teacher against whom a complaint is made will have his or her rights to due process fully observed, and a teacher's right of recourse to the courts will not be impinged.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides the Teaching Council with a range of remedies in the event of a teacher being found unsatisfactory, following the procedures I have just outlined. For example, a teacher may be retained on the register, subject to some conditions. The conditions are intended to assist the teacher to overcome the difficulties he or she is encountering and include referral to the teacher welfare service or to a relevant professional development course. In other cases, teachers may be suspended from the register for a period. In a very serious case, a teacher may be removed from the register. Removal from the register is obviously a very serious matter for the teacher concerned. In recognition of the very serious consequences of de-registration, any such decision by the council will require the assent of the High Court. This is provided for in section 43.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Teaching Council addresses this difficult but important task of disciplining a member will, no doubt, be watched with interest by all of us who have an interest in education. The relevant provisions in the Bill adequately meet the needs of these cases. The provisions are a fine balance between respecting the rights of teachers to fair consideration and due process and the rights of students and parents to have confidence in the system of redress open to them in the event of a complaint against a teacher.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will give members of the profession a significant measure of control over professional issues relating to all aspects of the teaching career, from recruitment and supply, through initial preparation, induction and probation, to in-career development, as well as for <Col N="1038" /> professional conduct and competence. Currently, there is no unified framework in place for the recognition of teachers and the accreditation of programmes of teacher education and training. At first level, the Department's inspectors have a role in this area; at second level the task falls to the Secondary Teachers Registration Council. In the changing and increasingly complex academic and professional world there is a need for a more unified approach. Increasingly, universities and colleges are designing more courses targeted at those who want to teach in our schools. The demand for recognition from teachers qualified outside Ireland is also increasing. Ireland is now part of a wider Europe and we must be mindful of our European Union and wider international obligations in regard to the recognition of qualifications. The Teaching Council will be the designated authority for the purpose of ensuring that these commitments are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides us with a timely opportunity to regularise and review accreditation procedures for teachers, whether qualified in Ireland or abroad. The Bill will repeal the Registration Council (Constitution and Procedures) Rules, 1926 under which the Registration Council operated and the council's functions will pass to the new Teaching Council. The Teaching Council will then be responsible for determining the education, training and qualifications required for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of registration.</P>
    <P>The role of the Teaching Council in regard to the professional education of teachers will not end when the teacher begins to teach. Rather, the Teaching Council will play an important part in the probation and induction of teachers and in the professional education of teachers throughout their careers.</P>
    <P>I know Deputies are conscious of the importance of fostering and developing good North-South contacts in all areas, including education. Deputies will also be aware that there have been very fruitful contacts between Ministers and Departments North and South in recent years, and that this interaction has now been formalised through the North-South Ministerial Council established within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement. The North-South Ministerial Council has already met twice in education sector format and has established a number of joint working groups to progress co-operation on matters of mutual concern. These groups are looking at issues such as special needs provision, tackling disadvantage, educational exchange activity and the position of teachers in the island as a whole. The groups will continue to report progress to the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done on the establishment of a teaching council in Northern Ireland. Section 7 specifically provides for co-operation with it so that an all-island approach can be taken where that is mutually beneficial. We have much in common with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in the <Col N="1039" /> high standards of education provided to our students. I am pleased the Bill gives statutory expression to this spirit of co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is much scope for co-operation in the areas within the remit of the Teaching Council and I know that both councils will approach this matter with the enthusiasm that has been the hallmark of previous endeavours in this field. There has been ongoing contact between officials on both sides of the Border as proposals for both councils have developed. We look forward to continuing close contact in the future.</P>
    <P>The initial stage in establishing the Teaching Council will be critical from the financial point of view. Until the first council is in place it will not be possible to levy fees and, therefore, provide the necessary finance to fund the initial phase of establishment. In the interim the start up costs will be provided from central funds. There are a number of reasons for this. The Teaching Council will assume responsibility for a range of functions currently being performed by my Department. In particular, the work now being done by the Registration Council will be transferred to the Teaching Council. The Teaching Council will provide a range of advisory services and expertise to my Department and it will make a significant contribution towards continuously improving the quality of education.</P>
    <P>In recognition of these services, it is appropriate that the Government, through my Department, signal its support for the work of the Teaching Council by financing its activities through this critical early period of development. Section 20 provides for this funding. The steering committee, which was representative of all the partners in education, recommended the payment of a membership fee by all new applicants for registration. It also recommended that the fee should be waived for the first year of registration in the case of existing teachers who qualify for registration with the council. Section 22 allows the council to set and charge fees.</P>
    <P>The high quality of the teaching profession in Ireland has been a theme running through my speech. The profession has traditionally attracted personnel of a consistently high calibre. We all have an interest in seeing this continue. The Teaching Council will be central to the development of the teaching profession in the future. Through the council the teaching profession will mature as a profession and reach a new stage in its development. The development to this point of the proposals for the council has taken place in close co-operation with those for whom it will be most immediately relevant, the teachers themselves. I look forward to continuing to work closely with teachers and the other partners in education as together we move to establish an Irish Teaching Council. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael believes that every child should have a legal right to the best possible edu<Col N="1040" /> cation and to an individual educational plan overseen by an Ombudsman for children with authority to see that resources and facilities to meet that educational requirement are provided by right. To achieve this objective the educational system must be radically overhauled. We have deluded ourselves for years as having the best educational system in the world. It is for those who are bright, intelligent and articulate and who can avail of our one chance system. However, for thousands of others the future is a dim tunnel of non-involvement, deep frustration and personal under achievement. A system starved of resources, seriously lacking in facilities and driven by a profession that is acutely disappointed, under remunerated and unable to achieve the heights of its potential is one that is not working satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>This Bill is only one element of what is required. Its range and remit are unclear in many respects and ill defined in others. If our education system is to perform to the highest standards in the interests of all pupils it must be driven by a profession that has standards, that rewards performance and that must be paid for.</P>
      <P>The Bill is being introduced at a time of deep unrest within the teaching profession. There is annoyance and deep frustration, reflected in the recent decision by the ASTI to take industrial action. This is symptomatic of a serious malaise within the profession, not only about a central issue like pay, but about a range of professional requirements and facilities that will allow professionally trained people to reach their capacity and achieve their full professional potential.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not state clearly what elements of departmental responsibility are to be removed from the Department of Education and Science and transferred to the Teaching Council. Nor does it state what impact the Teaching Council will have on the teacher training supply. It does not define clearly what will be the implications of complaints to the council where sacking, dismissals or allegations are made. It does not allow for the appointment of principals to the council from second level schools, even though they are ultimately responsible for the induction, probation and monitoring of teachers into the profession.</P>
      <P>Given the current desperate state of morale within the teaching profession, the Bill is not capable of being implemented. I hope the Select Committee on Education and Science will hear evidence from the relevant bodies and organisations before it proceeds to consider Committee Stage. The Bill is described as an Act to promote teaching as a profession, to promote the professional development of teachers, to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State, to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers and other matters relating to teachers and the teaching profession and to provide for their registration by means of the Teaching Council, An Chomhairle Mhúinteoireachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> Over the years the teaching profession has, by and large, served the State and the people well. There have been instances of outstanding teachers who have cared for the pupils and students way above and beyond the call of duty. They have received an education that has stood them in good stead to deal with life's experiences, both at home and abroad. No more than in any profession, there are teachers who have become frustrated and have found no way out of a rut other than to punch in time to the end of their remit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Teaching Council Bill, which has been around for more than 20 years. In that period the majority of the teacher unions called for the establishment of a teaching council and most Governments would have liked to have established one. In that sense the Bill is welcome in that it will put the profession of teaching on a platform and allow the public to judge it for its real value. If teaching is to be the jewel in the crown of public service, however, we have a long way to achieve it.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew the clear distinction between the responsibilities of teacher unions in respect of pay negotiations, salaries and conditions, and the responsibility of the teaching council in respect of perception, raising standards, teacher training and so on. One is not mutually exclusive of the other. If the teaching council were to arrive at a position where the profession of teaching was deemed to be very high in young people's minds, the remuneration levels &ndash; the 26 year incremental scale and the woeful lack of facilities &ndash; are a stark reminder of just how far we have to go. I would like to see a teaching profession in all categories that would be highly motivated, highly driven, well resourced and financed and able to build on its professional call to provide every child with an educational plan to reach his or her ultimate level of achievement.</P>
    <P>In the few months since I took up this brief, I have been shocked by the inadequacies that abound in many of our schools and within the profession. I met members of the parents of the Down's Syndrome association yesterday. A child of ten years of age, who suffered a stroke at the age of one and a half, has not had physiotherapy in approximately eight years. That is an abomination. We call ourselves Christians and boast that we have some of the highest standards in the world but incidents like this are simply appalling. I will send the Minister the details later.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a profession that is highly motivated and that people want to get into, we need to examine what is made available either through negotiations or demonstration from the Teaching Council that teachers require more than they have got and in return for which they will be expected to give a level of performance in keeping with the high standards being set by the Teaching Council.</P>
    <P>In time, we should have sabbaticals for teachers, particularly those who have taught for a <Col N="1042" /> number of years who find themselves wondering if they should continue in the profession. I am thinking of something akin to the Canadian system where every six or seven years teachers can take a sabbatical on full pay, having contributed towards that themselves, during which they can involve themselves in further educational courses which can be accredited incrementally. They can then decide whether to return to the profession of teaching.</P>
    <P>Young people starting out on a teaching career are being told that after 26 years they will reach their maximum salary. That is not just a problem for the teaching profession but applies in many walks of life, including the Civil Service. The appointment of principals at a designated level should be for a seven year period, they should retain their principal's allowance, their pension should be based on that but there should also be performance related measures. Many principals who are appointed to positions for life tend not to have the same level of commitment after a number of years as they should have and, no more than Secretaries General of Departments, they can perform at a high level for a shorter period.</P>
    <P>For those involved in the teaching profession at all levels, there should be the option of getting out for those who realise that teaching is not for them. I know many teachers, primary and secondary, who arrived at an understanding some time ago that teaching is not what they really want but career breaks or the other options that are currently open are not sufficiently broad or flexible to cater for that. Irrespective of its remit, the Teaching Council, as distinct from the teacher unions, should ensure that this profession can stand on any platform and attract bright, young, intelligent, articulate people who will want to give of their expertise in turning out future students who will be a credit to our country. That is not the case, however, and under the current regime I doubt if we will have many answers to those type of problems.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister referred to the question of teachers coming here from abroad and the training of teachers. I am interested in that because as the Minister is aware, we have almost 2,000 untrained teachers in the primary system and that is now beginning to take effect in the secondary system. We should be preparing to at least give the Teaching Council, when it is set up, some basis upon which to adjudicate and make recommendations that can be implemented in this regard. There are teachers in the system currently who have taught for more than 20 years but who cannot get recognition. That should be changed. They have experience that one cannot get in any training college because they acquired it over the years. Montessori teachers in the system are not given full recognition and that needs to be examined, as well as the current system of training which is not sufficiently flexible.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of teachers who received a recognised European Union qualifi<Col N="1043" /> cation in an EU country and their right to teach here. They may be brought in as resource teachers because they do not have to comply with the Irish qualification. If we are short of teachers, this has to be looked at as has the question of teachers from outside the European Union. I have on file a letter from a married woman who came to County Meath from Australia with full professional teaching qualifications but who was not recognised in Ireland. She left the country because of frustration with the Department and her view of its lack of imagination and creativity in this regard. We must examine how we can get people who have a teaching qualification into our system.</P>
    <P>We should avail of modern technology, and the Teaching Council should recommend that in the context of training teachers. Second level teachers who are married with families and who wish to teach in primary schools cannot attend a course for 18 months or three years. They should be able to use the virtual classroom to do courses from their own homes by distance learning, with the odd tutorial in between. That would enable them to do their training and achieve a recognised qualification from their own homes rather than having to travel at night, every weekend or attend a course on a full-time basis. We should examine all these options because if we are to maintain our position internationally as a country with a high reputation and a high level of educational standard, the profession needs assistance and should be given the opportunity to better perform.</P>
    <P>I referred to the drop in teacher numbers at primary level and the same applies to secondary schools. I am informed by a number of teaching sources that some schools have been unable to fill teaching posts in all categories over a range of subjects. In some cases these categories include permanent positions. Places cannot be filled in subjects such as metalwork, woodwork, home economics, business studies, science and Irish. This creates serious problems for schools which will either employ substitute teachers who are not qualified in the subject or change the curriculum on a long-term basis. Schools have started to remove metalwork, woodwork, business studies, science and home economics from their timetables or to reduce them greatly. The curriculum offered is not fitted to the students' needs but to the availability of teachers. Schools are required to fulfil a legal obligation. If a child is offered home economics in first, second, third, fourth and fifth year in preparation for the leaving certificate, surely there is a contractual obligation to provide a trained teacher in sixth year? The State might also be subject to litigation as has happened in other cases.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in the Dublin area and throughout the country in that teaching is not attractive to young graduates. This will continue until the entry point on the pay scale is changed. The Teaching Council should do something about <Col N="1044" /> the perception of teaching as a worthwhile profession. Only 38% of those who trained as metalwork and woodwork teachers last year decided to teach because remuneration levels were higher in the private sector due to the explosion in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has started a programme of whole school evaluation, but I am not sure at what stage it is at present. School development plans must look sensitively at issues in the school. If we want planning in every school, surely we must have planning in the Department? The Bill is not clear about the requirements and projected number of teachers over the next ten years. What are we doing about the shortage of speech therapists, physiotherapists, aural trained teachers and teachers in many other categories? If the State is found to be negligent in providing a decent and proper education for a child, what will the Department do about the projection requirements? Will we hive this off to the Teaching Council to make recommendations or to offer advice to the Department? Where does the authority ultimately lie?</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced an interesting set of figures for membership of the council. The council shall consist of 37 members. The teaching unions have made their case and this is obvious from the number of elected and registered teachers who will serve on the council. I am disappointed that only two persons can be nominated jointly by the National College of Art and Design, the National University of Ireland, Cork, the National University of Ireland, Dublin, the National University of Ireland, Galway, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Dublin University, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, St. Catherine's College of Education for Home Economics, Sion Hill and St. Angela's College of Education in Sligo. Only two persons can be nominated jointly by St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra, the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines, St. Mary's, Marino, Froebel College of Education, Sion Hill and Mary Immaculate College in the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of teachers in the primary system emerge from the two major training colleges, St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra, where I was a former resident, and Mary Immaculate College in the University of Limerick. If a person is nominated from each of these colleges &ndash; I would have thought that would be a necessity given the volume of teachers going through their doors &ndash;  that means the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines would not have any representative. If that happened, we could be open to the charge of discrimination on religious grounds. I am sure the Minister does not want to go down that road. It also means that St. Mary's, Marino or the Froebel College of Education, which are two smaller institutions, would not have any representation. The Minister should reconsider the bodies included in the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> I am unclear about what will happen if there are allegations of unethical practices, bad behaviour or threats of dismissal of a teacher. If, for example, a teacher in a school is guilty of gross misbehaviour, what influence does the Teaching Council have? As I understand it, a teacher cannot be dismissed in the vocational education system without a public sworn inquiry under the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944. If a parent, teacher or a third party writes to the Teaching Council about a teacher whose behaviour or misbehaviour is being investigated by management, is it required to set up an investigation committee or to have the matter investigated by a disciplinary committee? If so, what are the consequences of this work proceeding in parallel with the public sworn inquiry in the case of a VEC teacher or with an investigation in a second level school? The safeguard of the High Court assent in the case of ultimate de-registration is necessary because this is the ultimate sanction against a teacher. If sanctions are imposed on a teacher by the registrar of teachers, it will result in the usual talk about ability.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is important because it deals with the objectives of the council. These are to regulate the teaching profession and the professional conduct of teachers to establish and promote the maintenance and improvement of standards of programmes of teacher education and training, teaching, skill and competence of teachers in recognised primary and post-primary schools, and the professional conduct of teachers. These objectives have a direct bearing on the quality of teaching provided, the standards set by teachers and their performance. This will have an impact on the pupils and therefore it will involve parents. Education should be based on team work. It should involve trained professionals and extra assistance should be available when required.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has always had responsibility for the supply of teachers and for the professional development of teachers. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if these responsibilities will be handed over to the Teaching Council. Will standards be set on the basis of reports and advice from the Teaching Council? We are talking about the oldest Department in the country which needs a radical shake-up. It has had remarkable influence over the years. My difficulty with the Department has always been that it seems to regard the process as more important than the objective. One can drive from Dublin to Mayo in a reasonably straight line. However, the Department has sometimes tended to travel <i>via</i> Waterford and Dingle to get back up the west coast. Given the pressures to perform and to be able to perform, I hope the Minister will give this issue his full attention.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council could look at the issue of teaching practices. The best place in which to learn to teach is in front of a class. I am not sure the higher diploma in education for secondary teachers delivers adequate teaching practice stan<Col N="1046" /> dards. We need to seriously examine the extent of the course, the issue of day or block releases and the practical element of teaching in front of classes.</P>
    <P>It is a while since I was a practising teacher and I may be a little out of touch, but teaching standards and practices in other countries have been revolutionised in the past ten years, are very sophisticated and include high levels of training. I would like to think we could match these practices, that the Teaching Council would examine best international practices and that we would make no bones about implementing such practices in Ireland. The Minister should make the resources available to implement such practices as we are talking about the present and the future, and the international perception of Ireland as a country which can stand on its own two feet.</P>
    <P>Will a letter from an irate parent be sufficient to bring about the setting up of a disciplinary or investigating committee? If someone has a difference of opinion with a teacher, whether or not it involves a student on educational matters, does this mean that every whim has to be investigated by a disciplinary or investigating committee of the Teaching Council?</P>
    <P>Section 22 refers to the right to charge fees. Teachers are going on strike over pay and the other two unions may be sucked into this dispute which will have serious consequences for the entire fabric of the PPF. The Minister will be aware that some primary schools are located on second level campuses and that TUI members work in community schools and will not pass pickets. There will be strong resistance from teachers if the Teaching Council starts to levy unspecified charges in ten areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but the Department has a great deal of work to do and is in need of a radical overhaul. If we are to have a teaching profession of the highest standard the Department must have performance related standards and we must pay for it. That will be in the interests of every school going child, some of whom are sadly lacking facilities and resources, which is a shame on us all. Such an education system would also be in the interests of pupils who will attend schools in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. There has been widespread consultation with the education partners, including teachers, parents and managers in the preparation of the Bill and, by and large, the end product is a fair representation of the issues and concerns raised during that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there was such a long delay in publishing the Bill. Undertakings were given that the Teaching Council would be established by the beginning of this year. The timetable set out in the report of the steering committee indicated that it was intended to publish to Bill in November 1998 but this is almost November 2000 so there has been a two year slippage. <Col N="1047" /> That is unfortunate as the establishment of the Teaching Council is long overdue.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement within education on the need for a Teaching Council. The proposal is for a council which would be an independent, statutory agency which would exercise the powers and perform the functions through which teachers can achieve a large degree of professional autonomy and self regulation. The Bill also provides for a fair degree of accountability on the part of teachers. From a parents' perspective there has been some concern that it was difficult to get any satisfaction following complaints about standards in schools or the performance of individual teachers. Parents who found themselves in such situations will derive some comfort from the fact that there will now be a forum for dealing with serious complaints regarding misconduct.</P>
    <P>An important objective of the council is the setting of clear standards within the teaching profession and education generally. Too often in the past the development and operation of the education system has been left to the private sector, as it were. The reasons for this are partly historical due to the way in which our education system was established and the way in which it has evolved. Successive Governments were quite happy to allow the system develop in the hands of the private sector and there was little regulation and control over what happened. There was also very little accountability and it was easy for Governments to pass responsibility back to the religious orders or other bodies which provided education. Parents and pupils were caught in the middle of the process without any adequate form of redress. By and large, that system still obtains and the Department takes a hands off approach.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance on the part of education management bodies to continue with this kind of system and demands are being made on the Department to start playing a full role in the provision of education and a properly funded State education system. It has suited the churches and successive Governments to be able to pass the buck between themselves on this issue. The country is well able to afford it so we need to move towards a scenario whereby the Government fully funds the education system and takes responsibility for ensuring proper standards.</P>
    <P>A well established council has the potential to enhance the status of teaching and improve morale among teachers, thereby enhancing the quality of the education provided to pupils. This is an important objective for us all to keep to the fore. A Teaching Council has a role in enhancing morale and status among teachers but the current conditions in which teachers work are damaging morale to a point where urgent action is needed.</P>
    <P>It is clear from recent statements by the leaders of teacher unions and from last week's overwhelming result in the ASTI ballot that there is a high level of dissatisfaction and anger within the teaching profession. There is no doubt that teach<Col N="1048" /> ing has become much more difficult and challenging in recent years. Many more pupils are presenting in schools with social problems and, as a result, engaging in disruptive behaviour. The kind of problems we see in the Children's Court on a daily basis and the marked increase in public order and anti-social problems on the streets and in local communities are all reflected in classroom behaviour. The increased rate of family breakdown combined with high rates of alcohol and drug abuse in recent years, and the effects of these on student behaviour and performance, all contribute to increased demands on teachers in the classroom. In addition, there are greatly increased responsibilities placed on teachers in respect of recent legislation. Too often we see new legislation enacted, such as the Education Welfare Act, 1998, but insufficient resources being allocated to facilitate the full implementation of that legislation. The under funding of the education system generally causes its own problems for teachers with added pressures caused by working in poor school buildings with inadequate supports. It is difficult for teachers to feel professional about themselves, their role and their work if they are trying to teach in a professional manner in a cold classroom in a dilapidated school building. It is difficult for teachers to feel professional if they must get involved in fund-raising in order to meet heating or cleaning bills in a school. It is difficult for teachers to feel professional about their work if there is no back-up available, if, for example, the provision of secretarial supports and caretakers in schools is totally inadequate as it is at present. It is also difficult for teachers to feel professional about their work if they know additional services such as psychological, counselling and speech therapy are necessary in order for them to do a professional job and they know well that those services are simply not available. They know that the system is short-changing the children they are trying to teach and that the supports are not in place, that it is totally under funded. In those circumstances it is difficult for teachers to feel professional about their work and to feel that they, in turn, are being valued for doing their important job. Clearly they feel undervalued.</P>
    <P>Status, whether we like it or not, is generally determined by a person's earning ability and by the financial reward society gives to people for their work. Teachers are standing by and watching while comparable graduate employment pay is leaving them far behind. They are seeing colleagues with whom they were in university going on to work either in other jobs in the public sector or increasingly in the private sector and coming out in five years with salaries to which teachers could not even aspire after 25 years service. Younger teachers are finding that they cannot realistically aspire to own their homes because their pay levels simply will not allow them do that. Already we are seeing a high drop out rate from the profession as newly qualified teachers are attracted to jobs in the private sec<Col N="1049" /> tor, where pay scales promotion prospects and job satisfaction are better than in teaching.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is likely to be serious unrest within the teaching profession over the coming months and I would urge the Minister to take immediate action to address the genuine concerns of teachers and to put in place a mechanism to deal with their serious grievances in a shorter time scale than that provided for under the PPF. Teachers will simply not accept what the Government is suggesting. As the House will be aware, the ASTI rejected the PPF, the INTO only accepted it by a very small margin and the TUI is now talking about the need for pay increases of the order of 20% over and above what is provided for under the PPF. There are rocky times ahead in all sectors of education unless the Minister deals with this matter urgently. There can be whatever kind of teaching councils or other mechanisms or distractions the Minister likes, but unless the pay and conditions of teachers are dealt with adequately, we are facing the prospect of increasingly low morale, anger and increasing recruitment problems within the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>It makes sense to establish a professional body to regulate and enhance the professionalism of teachers. As the House will be aware, most other professions such as the legal and medical professions have their own regulatory bodies. Many other countries have teaching councils and lessons should be learned from their experience. A properly established council will achieve a number of objectives. As well as helping to confirm the status of teaching, it will entitle teachers to appropriate regulation of their own affairs and endow them with greater responsibility for the quality of teaching.</P>
    <P>It will also have an important role in overseeing teacher education programmes. Issues of new demands on teachers and new requirements emerge in the classroom in terms of training, dealing with disciplinary issues among students, curriculum development, etc., and there is a significant time-lapse between the experience gained in the classroom and within schools and changes to the training programme. It is important to have this overseeing body, which can draw on the experience of what is happening in the classroom and which will have a foot in the training colleges.</P>
    <P>Another important role for the council will obviously be in looking at the question of supply and demand for teachers. Later this evening the Joint Committee on Education and Science will deal with that very matter because we have got to a point where it is critical, certainly in the primary schools. Almost 70% of post-primary schools are reporting difficulties in recruiting staff. There is too much of a time-lag between problems of recruitment emerging and programmes, whether they be the post-graduate programme or the traditional training programme, being put in place to increase the numbers and ensure that the supply meets demand. I hope the new Teaching Council <Col N="1050" /> will bridge that gap and play an important role in ensuring adequate supply on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Another important factor related to teacher supply is recognition of different qualifications, whether they are obtained in an EU or non-EU country. There are many fine teachers, who have trained abroad, doing an excellent job in the schools and because recognition has been withheld many of them are working for even lower pay than their fully trained and recognised colleagues. This is a sore point. Where there is a shortage of teachers it seems wrong that we should discriminate against highly qualified people who are not given the recognition they deserve just because those qualifications come from abroad.</P>
    <P>This area of recognition needs urgent attention in terms of improving the supply of teachers. Deputy Kenny has already referred to a number of categories of people in the teaching profession which are not fully recognised. Programmes need to be put in place to ensure that those people can easily gain the necessary qualifications in order to be recognised fully and paid properly. Some provision of in-service or block release training should be available for the cohort of people working in schools, who started off as substitute teachers 20 or 25 years ago and who have first class records in teaching and excellent experience, to facilitate them in gaining full qualification. In addition, there is scope for the Montessori teachers, and for teachers without the Irish qualification who have qualifications from the UK or Northern Ireland. There is a demand for teachers like that, many of whom are very committed. There are schools crying out for that kind of experience where the teaching of Irish may not be very relevant or there may be innovative ways of getting around that whereby somebody else in the school can take the class for Irish. There is an urgent need to direct attention at that. The Department or the Minister is not doing that at present. I would like to see the teaching council play a very central role in that issue.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in Ireland that teaching has traditionally attracted personnel of a high calibre and it is vital that this continues to be the case. I reiterate what I said already that it will not continue to be the case as long as teachers feel they are being undervalued, underpaid and not represented properly at the Cabinet table. The Minister has a very important function in ensuring that teachers get the recognition and remuneration they deserve. It is all very well talking about national agreements and sticking to the terms of the agreement but the same thing is going to happen to teaching as happened to nursing. People will vote with their feet and they will leave. There are plenty of other opportunities for teachers to get much better paid jobs, jobs in which they will be treated in a more professional manner and in which they are valued more. Unless attention is given to this area as a matter of urgency, there will be a haemorrhaging of teachers from the sys<Col N="1051" /> tem and we will soon find ourselves in a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>The existing teaching force has demonstrated great commitment to professional development through engagement in a high level of in-service training opportunities. It is important that we build on that through the teaching council. In order to ensure vibrancy and innovation in teaching, it is timely that the council is being established to promote the advancement of standards in the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>One of the roles proposed for the teaching council is to provide a forum for the education partners in the promotion of quality and high standards in education, and this is certainly welcome. At present there is no forum in which those issues are being addressed. We have a very austere and inflexible Department dealing with education and the regulation of education, the funding of schools, etc., on a very centralised basis. There is very little opportunity for debate or any kind of discourse or discussion about education policy &ndash; there simply is not an adequate forum for that. My party's position is that we should have local structures in education which would provide that kind of platform to address local education issues and meet education need. However, because of the way the Department of Education and Science is structured, that kind of debate is not happening and education is the poorer. I hope that under the proposal here, the teaching council, we can involve all the partners in promoting standards, in being agents for change and in devising policy and that it can be a forum in which policy can evolve.</P>
    <P>A critical factor in the success or otherwise of the proposed council will be the commitment of the Minister to properly fund the establishment of the council. We should not underestimate for one moment how important this will be. The Minister has spoken about this but he has not given any clear commitment in terms of the level of or the extent of funding which he is prepared to provide. Before we complete consideration of this Bill, I ask the Minister to give very clear commitments, in terms of figures, on the funding he intends to provide for the establishment of the council.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the council will assume responsibility for a range of functions which are currently carried out by the Department. In addition, the council is expected to provide an advisory service and to contribute to the ongoing improvement in quality of education. It would seem that the council is being asked to take on a range of responsibilities which are currently &ndash; in theory anyway &ndash; carried out by the Department of Education and Science. At the very least, the full establishment costs, by way of grant, should be provided as well as setting up the council in properly resourced headquarters. I ask the Minister to give a clear commitment on that so that from the start, the council can be up and running on a proper footing and that it will not be looking <Col N="1052" /> for premises or funding for premises in a year's time. Let us do this properly from the start and give a commitment that it will be put on a proper footing with decent headquarters so it can operate as the professional regulatory body which it is intended to be.</P>
    <P>After the initial establishment, it is envisaged that the council will be self-financing. In view of the functions of the Department of Education and Science which the council is expected to take on, I do not see that that makes sense. There should be a commitment from the Minister in relation to the ongoing funding of at least aspects of the work of the council. It will be very limited in terms of what functions it can take on if it is expected to be self-financing. On grounds of fairness, some ongoing funding should be provided given the responsibilities it is taking off the shoulders of the Department.</P>
    <P>One of the main functions of the teaching council is to advise the Minister on various aspects of education. I am concerned that the provision there is a little bit loose. The Bill states that advice would be available to the Minister, or something along those lines. There is a need to strengthen that a little. If the Minister is setting up this body, which is representative of all the partners in education, a very professional body, there should be some obligation on the Minister of the day to have regard to advice from the council. For that reason, we should think about an amendment to oblige, or require, the Minister to have regard to advice from the council. At the very least, if the Minister does not take the advice of the council, he or she should be required to make a clear statement as to why they are rejecting that advice. We want this to be a real, active and professional body which makes a real contribution to the development of education. There is no point having it if it is just going to be a talking shop running parallel to the Department of Education and Science. It has to be very much integrated. It is expected to take on responsibilities from the Department and, in turn, the Department and the Minister of the day should be expected to take on board the advice from the council. I will certainly table amendments to strengthen the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>The distinction between the role of the teaching council and the trade unions is a very important one to make. There could be improvements in the wording of the Bill in that regard. Rather than teacher representatives representing their members, we might change the wording of the Bill to read: &ldquo;present the views of members&rdquo;. That very much raises connotations of the functions of a trade union, that is, to represent its members. The role of the teaching council should be to present the views of its members. That is something at which we will look on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There has been some correspondence from the principals of the post primary schools. They have expressed dissatisfaction that they are not specifi<Col N="1053" /> cally represented on the council. I would welcome the Minister's views on that. A number of them are represented through the various trade unions and could stand for election by their own members. However, I would like to hear the Minister's view on that because they seem quite disappointed about the lack of specific provision for them.</P>
    <P>Two parent representatives on a 37 member body seems quite a small number of representatives of the consumers of the education service. The body could be strengthened in that area.</P>
    <P>I generally welcome the Bill. It has a useful role to play in the development of the teaching profession, in terms of regulating the profession, dealing with disciplinary matters, ensuring standards and achieving quality in education, which are all very important. However, it is only a very small part of what is needed in education.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the position of teachers on matters such as morale and professionalism. He knows the deep dissatisfaction and concern there is among the teacher unions at the failure to recognise adequately their contribution to the development of education, the Celtic tiger and the economic success the country is enjoying at the moment. There are very strong grievances at the lack of recognition of that contribution. They did a good job when times were hard, and most teachers expected that when things picked up and the cutbacks ended they would get a share in the prosperity.</P>
    <P>Many teachers feel very sore that, having contributed much to the educational development of their students, which they were happy to do, they are lagging seriously behind in the area of financial recognition for the job they do. That is very damaging to morale and must be tackled in a serious and acceptable way and according to a timetable acceptable to teachers. I am not talking about the possibility of an increase through benchmarking in June 2003 but something much sooner than that. That is the most important thing.</P>
    <P>There are also major problems in education to be tackled, such as the unwieldy, inflexible and centralised nature of the Department and its inability to respond to local education needs. There is an inability among many of the decision makers, from the Minister down to senior management, to empathise with the kind of educational demands which arise in disadvantaged areas, in particular. We are all conscious of the huge cultural gap between those at a senior level in the Department and the kind of children who are least served by the education system. The centralised nature of the Department contributes to that.</P>
    <P>We need to look at new ways of delivering education services and ensuring there is local response to local needs, which there is not at the moment. The global figures, in terms of retention rates, leaving certificate participation rates and so on, are fair but they are not very good and they are slipping slightly back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> However, those figures hide very severe concentrated problems in particular areas of social and economic disadvantage, where the education system is not acting as the agent of change which it should be. It is not giving people the opportunity to break out from the cycle of poverty and disadvantage, which it should do, because it is not responding to their needs.</P>
    <P>There is very limited targeting of resources to the areas most in need. In areas of severe disadvantage there are pilot projects, such as Early Start and Breaking the Cycle. However, those special targeted initiatives have not been expanded in the past three years and there are disgraceful participation rates because of inadequate resources. There are still classes which are far too big, given the nature of the problems pupils are presenting with. There are still problems of children not transferring from primary school to secondary school &ndash; some 2,000 slipped out of the net at that point last year. That is a serious indictment of the education system.</P>
    <P>There are still inadequate career guidance and counselling services for children with serious social problems, which are cropping up on an increasingly frequent basis. The ordinary teaching staff are not in a position to cope with the scale of social problems that are now presenting in some schools. The existence of children with those problems, and their consequent behavioural problems, is mitigating against their classmates, who are trying in difficult circumstances to achieve a good standard of education. Teachers feel they are letting down their classes because of their difficulties coping with that kind of behavioural problem. Unless the Minister is prepared to put in the necessary resources, those children will continue to drop out and, in turn, appear before the Children's Court on more serious charges and their classmates will be deprived of the education they should receive.</P>
    <P>There are many areas which need urgent attention. I welcome this Bill, in as far as it goes. It will make a small contribution to the developments in education but much more needs to be done.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation, which has been talked about by various Governments over the years. The first aim of the Bill is to promote teaching as a profession, which is very important to the teacher unions and the partners in education. The whole question of teaching as a profession is very much in the limelight at the moment.</P>
      <P>The issues of the quality of teaching in the State and providing for the establishment of standards for education and training of teachers are also important. The Minister also spoke about the question of registration and regulation of teachers, which is very important. Competence standards will also be established through this Teaching Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note, from what the Minister said, that a teaching council has been talked about since 1991, when the OECD produced the review of <Col N="1055" /> Irish education. It was also mentioned in the 1992 Green Paper on education, known as Education for a Changing World. There has been widespread consultation on the Bill in the past two and a half years, which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>When issues have arisen in relation to discipline or dismissal of teachers, the teacher unions have often asked why they should not have a teaching council, like the Medical Council. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, the Medical Council has been part of our health system for many years. It is important for us to proceed along that avenue in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of accountability of teachers, which is one of the reasons the Bill has been welcomed. However, parents will also welcome the Bill as their role is outlined in it.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned today with the issue of having a qualified teaching staff. It is important, in that context, to highlight the need for remedial and resource teachers. That every school has now got access to a remedial and resource teacher is one of the very welcome initiatives the Government has brought in. Where there are clusters of schools, remedial and resource teachers sometimes have to cover a wide area to see the children in the various schools. This is an important issue in rural areas. I hope we will move towards the remedial, resource and special education teachers sharing fewer schools and not having to spend a large portion of their week travelling to the various schools. This issue has arisen on many occasions among teachers and parents in rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is difficulty recruiting qualified teachers. It is also difficult to get temporary and substitute teachers, even teachers for permanent posts. This has been the subject of debate in the education and science committee. Today Deputy Sargent produced a report in that regard which the committee will discuss later this evening. It brings the shortage of teachers into focus. There has been a lack of proper planning for many years. One teacher training college was closed. When the training colleges changed teacher training from a two to a three year cycle the intake to the colleges was frozen for a period.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an increase in the number of students taking up the teacher training course. In 1998, for example, the intake increased to 1,000 and the graduate courses recommenced. I understand there will be another graduate course next year. This often caused overcrowding and inadequate resourcing at college level but it had to be done and was most welcome. According to the INTO, the output for 2001 will be 1,300 graduates.</P>
    <P>Every year I hear about the disappointment of the many students who are not &ldquo;called to training&rdquo;, as it was formerly known. Why are the points so high, now that the points system applies to the teacher training colleges? Approximately 440 points were required this year and many <Col N="1056" /> students who got more than 420 points were disappointed not to have got the teacher training course. The same problem has occurred in nursing with the introduction of degree courses and high qualification standards. As a result, people who have a real vocation for teaching or nursing have been disappointed not to be able to enter those professions. In the Western Health Board area the training courses for nurses are linked to the university, as is the case with teacher training, and people are disappointed that the points required are so high. Given that we need more teachers, the Central Applications Office will have to look at this issue again. I am aware the Minister cannot deal with it in this legislation but it is particularly relevant at present.</P>
    <P>The INTO says that class sizes are too high, particularly where there are multi class situations. That organisation is also keen to have more people entering the training colleges. It mentions, in particular, the supply panel. The supply panel of teachers in many districts is extremely low. In the Louth, Monaghan and Cavan district, for example, six supply teachers cover 26 of the 250 schools. In fact, large areas of the country have not ever heard of a supply teacher. This issue must be addressed. A total of 900 teachers is required for the supply panels and the INTO makes a strong case for these to be provided.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has been brought to the attention of the education and science committee is the difficulty experienced by principal teachers finding substitute teachers. More and more schools employ untrained people or retired teachers for substitute work. Principals might have to make up to 20 phone calls in an effort to find a teacher. At the same time principals have classes to teach and administrative duties to fulfil. There are obvious difficulties. The Minister is good at putting his case to the Cabinet so I urge him to secure extra funding for teachers. The Department of Education and Science decides the number of students to be taken in by the teacher training colleges. Perhaps the Minister will say if there will be a change in that regard.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession, particularly in the primary sector, is most concerned about untrained and unqualified teachers working as substitute teachers. It has been pointed out that this would not happen in any other profession. A lay person would not be employed to replace a nurse or doctor on sick leave. It is an issue the teachers are anxious to address. Teachers can pick and choose where they teach and this is also causing difficulty. They can leave a small school where there are multi classes or a school in a disadvantaged area and move to a more affluent school. This results in disruption where qualified replacements cannot be found.</P>
    <P>This problem has been raised with the Department. The officials told us that in many ways we are the victims of our success. Enrolments in primary schools were declining for many years. During the 1990s, for example, enrolments were decreasing at a rate of 11,000 annually. Successive <Col N="1057" /> Governments decided to retain in the system the teaching posts which would otherwise have become surplus and, as a consequence, there was a steady reduction in class sizes and the allocation of hundreds of posts to areas of special need and disadvantage. If these posts had not been retained, the supply of trained teachers would have far exceeded the demand. As a result of the demographic dividend, as it is known, there are extra teaching posts and the number of teachers in the system has increased by approximately 1,000 since 1995 but there is additional pressure in the demand for trained teachers.</P>
    <P>The number of teachers opting for early retirement increased following the introduction of the early retirement scheme under the PCW agreement. The number of retirements increased from 443 in 1995 to 603 in 1999. This has had an effect throughout the education system but particularly at primary level. There are 156 teachers in the job-sharing scheme which was introduced in 1993 and approximately 800 teachers are on career breaks this year. The welcome news is that the number of students in the colleges of education has increased.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for contact with the relevant body in Northern Ireland and for recognition of qualifications of teachers trained outside this State. That is important. Graduates from St. Mary's College, Belfast, can teach in schools in the Republic and primary degree holders who have a H.Dip in Education are recognised as fully trained for substitute teaching. That is welcome.</P>
    <P>Since the Joint Committee on Education and Science of which I am a member visited Belfast last year we have had excellent co-operation from the authorities there. We went there to discuss the role of music education and we were pleased to note substantial resources are allocated to music education there. Following the committee's production of a report on music education to which the Minister has given a favourable response, I hope similar resources will be allocated to music education in our schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the North-South Ministerial Council established under the Good Friday Agreement provides a basis for formalised interaction between Ministers and Departments, North and South. He referred to substitute and temporary teachers who have worked for years in our education system. Their case has been documented and put to the Department on a number of occasions. I have met long-serving substitute and temporary teachers with leaving certificate qualifications who have been working for 20 to 30 years in our primary schools. They seek a status or grade that will recognise the role they have played over those years. They are disappointed they are not entitled to sick pay, holiday pay, maternity leave, a pension, salary protection, increments or job security despite the fact that they do the same work as recognised qualified teachers. The question of their registration and the reports they sent to the Department should be examined. Such teachers have attended in<Col N="1058" /> service courses that were available and following the introduction of the excellent new curriculum in primary schools they have attended in-service training courses on that curriculum.</P>
    <P>Substitute and temporary teachers were able to complete a conversion course in the past to regularise their positions, but such a course has not been held since 1975. They cannot complete the current conversion course, as participants must hold a primary degree, which they do not have. They made a strong submission to the Department seeking to regularise their positions and requesting the Minister to take account of their experience and dedication and to grant them a status or a grade in keeping with their years of experience and commitment. Given that we are discussing this Bill, I ask the Minister to examine if they have a role to play in our education system.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Education and Science received a submission from the Church of Ireland Board of Education which has been seeking to introduce rationalisation in schools under the patronage of the Church of Ireland. It made the point that there are 200 national schools in the sector of which 50% are two teacher schools and 10% have administrative principals. It gave an example of such rationalisation whereby countries such as Leitrim, Limerick, Longford and Offaly would each have three national schools under its patronage. I hope the points it made about the availability of teachers and other difficulties will be addressed by the Department. It carried out a surveys of the needs of the schools under its patronage and raised the question of setting up a supply panel on a pilot scheme basis with a view to extending it nationwide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to teaching practice. That the two year training course in primary school training colleges has been extended to three years is helpful in that it provides more beneficial practical teaching practice for students, but I do not know if much progress has been made regarding the higher diploma in education. In that regard, block release programmes are in place but there is not provision for a similar level of teaching practice. The Minister, the Teaching Council and the inspectorate should examine the question of teaching practice. While the role of an inspectorate may be non-existent in some European countries, our inspectorate plays a strong role, which is provided for in the Education Act. The question of teaching practice must be addressed. If students do not get practical teaching experience, it is difficult for them to obtain it later in in-service courses.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill to fruition. I hope members of the Teaching Council will be successful in their work on behalf of the council and the young people who will be taught in our schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a letter I received from him today regarding the appointment of a third teacher to Achonry national <Col N="1059" /> school, which I raised recently on an Adjournment Debate. That appointment is very much appreciated.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that the Bill before us will repeal the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1914, which has been on the Statute Book for 86 years. The Bill is to promote teaching as a profession; to promote the professional development of teachers; to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State; to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers and other matters relating to teachers and the teaching profession; to provide for the registration and regulation of teachers and to enhance professional standards and competence; and for those purposes to establish a council. The establishment of such a council is long overdue and very much welcomed.</P>
      <P>Part 2 provides that the objects of the council shall be to regulate the teaching profession and the professional conduct of teachers; to establish and promote the maintenance and improvement of standards of programme of teachers, education and training, teaching knowledge, skill and competence of teachers in recognised primary and post-primary schools; and to promote the continuing education and training and professional development of teachers. That is very important. Part 2 also provides that the functions of the council shall be to promote teaching as a profession; and to establish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers, which shall include standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence. The current standards among the teaching profession must be established and defined.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, teachers in our secondary schools have been responsible for educating most of our people very well. Lack of funding in certain areas is slowly choking the secondary school system. Secondary schools have made an enormous contribution to this country over the past 100 years. We can be proud of the selfless and voluntary service provided by many dedicated religious and lay people in our secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital grant is the mechanism by which voluntary schools are funded. Currently the grant allocated is £192 per pupil and £222 per pupil in schools designated as disadvantaged. In real terms, schools receive £30 less per pupil, as this sum is the notional amount allocated from the capitation towards the £400 per annum part of the teacher's salary, so the capitation is actually £172 and £202 respectively. The grants for secretarial services of £10,500 and £7,950 for caretaking are also hopelessly inadequate and do not come close to a proper salary today. These grants are well below the necessary amounts required by schools to finance costs for heating, lighting and maintenance as well as repairs and staffing resources. The financing and resourcing of voluntary schools have always been less than they <Col N="1060" /> should be and have now fallen well behind other post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>The complexity and variety of the principal's role is another issue. It is a challenging and rewarding one for many principals, but there is also evidence of overloading as well as a lack of focus making the position less tenable to classroom teachers and current incumbents. There is general recognition that the responsibility for leadership, management and administration have become more onerous and diverse in recent years. The conflicting demands faced by most principal teachers who undertake a dual role, combining full-time teaching duties with the administrative, leadership and management roles, lie in the centre of many disputes taking place at present. Principal teachers with full-time teaching duties should be relieved of their duties for set periods each month to enable them to undertake their non-teaching and administrative duties. This is a huge pressure on principals and substitute cover should be provided for this purpose. Immediate arrangements should be made to provide facilities in schools where the principal has full-time teaching duties. Principal teachers with full-time teaching duties should be relieved of their duties for set periods to carry out the large range of non-teaching duties for the successful delivery of a quality primary educational service. In addition, school caretakers and secretaries should be appointed on a shared basis to cater for the needs of urban and rural schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of almost 1,000 teachers being involved in one day stoppages in Munster, Connacht and Ulster on this issue. The long-delayed publication of the report on post-primary school funding offers an opportunity to provide an adequate funding system for secondary schools. The report recommends a funding system which takes account of the needs of the school to meet fixed costs such as heating, lighting and insurance. An equitable, fair and transparent mechanism for funding all second level schools must be stressed and the running costs of our schools must be met by central funding. The voluntary contributions which some schools depend on have led to anomalies in how voluntary secondary schools are funded and that must be recognised. The report has acknowledged, finally, the need to address the imbalances that have existed in post-primary schools for a number of years. Other points raised relate to a formula for funding taking account of enrolment and insurance and subject to material costs to allocate an initial 90% of the total non-paid funding, while the balance of 10% would be paid as supplementary funding.</P>
    <P>All recognised second level schools should receive grants sufficient to facilitate the purchase of services and equipment as well as a full-time secretary and a full-time caretaker. Schools require a significant increase in income to meet growing demands which are compounded by a decreasing school population. There needs to be <Col N="1061" /> a minimum increase in capitation, therefore, of £50 per pupil.</P>
    <P>The phased lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio would alleviate much of the disadvantage experienced by pupils today. A reduction in teaching contact time for assistant principals from 22 hours to 18 hours is an essential target that needs to be achieved. The report also recommends that the Department grant-aid schools for the employment of ancillary staff for supervision at lunch or breaks. That is also important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt mentioned teachers taking voluntary retirement. There is huge pressure on teachers and the formation of this board is very welcome. Section 8 of the Bill relates to boards of management and states that the council shall consist of 37 members, with two members appointed by the Minister and 11 registered teachers employed in or qualified to teach in recognised primary schools, nine of whom shall be elected by registered teachers employed in or qualified to teach in recognised primary schools. In addition, two persons shall be nominated jointly by bodies such as St. Patrick's College, the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, St. Mary's of Marino and St. Angela's College, Sligo. I was at the conferring ceremony in St. Angela's last week, which was also attended by the President of the NUI, Galway, a body which is linked to St. Angela's. The Minister should check out a problem raised with me regarding only 100 students being accredited by the Department &ndash; there are up to 500 students taking adult education degree courses at the college, but it is only getting funding for an approved 100.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the funding for St. Angela's, as it is a wonderful educational facility in Sligo that complements the Sligo Institute of Technology. It is very important that St. Angela's receives sufficient funding and I ask the Minister to look into this, as my inquiries suggest the college is disappointed with its level of funding. There is a huge enrolment by mature students in weekend and evening courses there and it is important to recognise these people by funding them.</P>
    <P>Many of the universities are based in Dublin or other large centres, but a regional balance is very important in this area. When the final council is appointed there should be representatives of each region, regardless of whether they come from the NUI panel or the primary education panel. No part of the country should be excluded.</P>
    <P>Section 7(3) states that the council in the performance of its functions shall &ldquo;implement the policies relating to teacher education and training, probation, qualifications, professional conduct and standards of teaching as established, from time to time, by the Minister&rdquo;. What is the Department's role in this regard? Perhaps the Minister could provide clarification in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 8 states that the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of an appropriate gen<Col N="1062" /> der balance as he or she may determine, from time to time, when making appointments. The Minister should take a firm stance on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the role of the director. The council will comprise 37 members and the director will be appointed within two years of the establishment of the council. In addition, he or she will be appointed in accordance with procedures determined by the council subject to the consent of the Minister. Why must the Minister wait two years before appointing the director, particularly if his or her role is so important?</P>
    <P>Section 13(1) states that &ldquo;Subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, the Council may, from time to time, appoint such and so many persons to be employees of the Council as the Council may determine.&rdquo; What we do not want is the establishment of a quango to provide jobs for the boys. We require a body that will improve educational standards and the primary role of which will be to promote teaching as a profession, encourage the professional development of teachers and maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State. We do not want people to be appointed to the board who do not have expertise relevant to this area. In certain instances, people are appointed to boards who do not have proven expertise. We need to appoint people who will honour and promote the concept and ideals of the body. It is important that parents should play a role on the council. In addition, it should not be dominated solely by teachers and its membership should include lay people, representatives of teaching bodies and school advisory groups.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with membership of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament and states that where an employee of the council is nominated or elected to membership of either of these bodies &ldquo;he or she shall thereupon stand seconded from employment by the Council and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from the Council, any remuneration, fees and allowances for expenses in respect of the period commencing on such nomination or election&rdquo;. Will the Minister clarify the position in that regard, particularly in view of the fact that section 15(2) states that &ldquo;A period referred to in subsection 1 shall not, for the purposes of any superannuation benefit, be reckoned as service with the Council&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with inquiries and the removal of members of the council from office, which is extremely important. Section 16(1) states:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is of the opinion that the Council has failed, neglected or refused to perform a function assigned to it under this Act or has failed effectively to perform any such function or otherwise is in breach of this Act, the Minister may, after first advising the Council of his or her opinion and considering any explanation given in response, appoint a person to inquire into any matter giving rise to the Minister's opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> What evidence would be required in this regard and how would such an inquiry be initiated?</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with national schools and the role played by principals. There is a need to provide support services in this regard. The council will be an important body but its work must focus on the role played by the providers of education and the services on offer. Second level schools have been credited with fostering Ireland's high educational standards and developing the skills of those who brought about our booming economy and it has been stated that this was achieved through investment in the 1970s and 1980s. In my opinion, however, our economic success is a testament to the dedication of teachers who worked very hard in the 1980s and 1990s and overcame the inadequacies of the structures in which they operated.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger has brought billions of pounds into this country and the day of principals being obliged to clean classrooms and provide caretaking and other services should be long gone. People in business often state that &ldquo;turnover is vanity and profit is sanity&rdquo;. We must protect the sanity of teachers who are obliged to carry out the humbling tasks to which I refer. These people must be given a sense of pride in the job they do, particularly in view of the fact that they are obliged to supervise pupils in the school yard at lunchtime and provide sanitary and other services. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that investment in the education system should be targeted at those operating at the very bottom level.</P>

      <P>Not long after we entered office a major investment was made in providing educational technology to the extent that every school has access to the Internet. In addition, quite a high degree of technology is now available in our schools.</P>
      <P>The Government made the Education Act, a key item of legislation which the previous Administration prepared in draft form, its own and turned it into something that was acceptable to the education partners. The Bills brought forward in the House have come about as a result of widespread consultation with the education partners.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on piloting the Education Welfare Bill through the Dáil when he had so recently taken responsibility for his Department. That Act will help to address many of the issues which had been left for years, such as the lack of a school attendance, child psychological and curriculum development services. He has now introduced the Teaching Council Bill. At almost every congress or conference I attended during my teaching career a call was made for a teaching council. The Minister also proposes to amend the VEC Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be important for teachers, pupils, parents and the country as a whole. I pay tribute to all the partners in education. I pay tribute to teachers for the quality of the service they have delivered to their students in difficult circumstances in small and large schools and often in overcrowded, unheated and dirty classrooms. The testimony of their work is to be seen in the educational standard of their students. It is only in recent times that parents have been taken on board as real partners in education. They have brought their unique perspective to primary and second level education. Who would have thought when parents were given a tiny grant by the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, that their organisation would grow into the significant influence it is today. The Bill is important because it places us at the cutting edge of significant development in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The self regulation of the teaching profession has been called for again and again. I welcome it. The Bill is the product of the steering committee. It is a consensus document and I do not expect a great amount of disagreement on it. The architectural, engineering and nursing professions and every profession worthy of the name has its own <Col N="1065" /> self-regulation. I wonder if our absent colleagues in the press gallery would agree to a similar regulation of their profession. I am sure they would think of many reasons they should be different from the rest of us.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses entry procedures, standards of teaching and professional performance, professional conduct, grievance procedures and the welfare of teachers. It will be hugely important to the 44,000 teachers in first and second level. Teaching has undergone a remarkable change in recent years. In the short time since I left the profession, probably temporarily, there has been remarkable change in curriculum development.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny's reassurance is very welcome.</P>
      <P>Changes in the curriculum have been remarkable. I compliment the teaching profession which is going through a difficult period. There is no doubt that morale has been higher. However, I have complete trust in the capacity of the Minister for Education and Science to address current difficulties. I have no doubt he and the Government will work closely with the teacher unions and parents to address the current temporary difficulties.</P>
      <P>For parents, the Bill will provide an assurance that the teachers who work with their children will meet the highest standard of professional qualification and competence through a professional code of conduct. That provision is amply developed in a range of areas in the Bill. It will copperfasten the already high standards of education which have been so important to the economic and social development of the State.</P>
      <P>Teachers have been asked to take on a range of new areas of responsibility. Some of us will attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science this evening where we will discuss a report on staffing difficulties in schools. The demands on teachers are constantly changing. When he was Minister for Social Welfare the Minister displayed remarkable foresight in facilitating unemployed people who wished to return to full-time education. I attended a meeting last evening in a school where I chair the board of management. In this school the number of people in return-to-education courses has increased from 125 last year to 175 this year. Many of these students are former pupils of my colleagues and myself who had dropped out of school early, gone into low paid jobs and who suffer many difficulties including low self-esteem. Teachers are now devising a curriculum which is appropriate to their needs.</P>

    <P>It is important that the new and more difficult <Col N="1066" /> areas of education be resourced. Although we have virtually full employment many people have a great yearning for education but they will not easily get back into the workforce. Pupil teacher ratios of 1:5 or 1:10 are needed in adult education classes and this will be very expensive. These adults are the last remaining group who are in difficulty in our economy and they need to be supported.</P>
    <P>It is important that the grievance procedures in the Bill are fair and equitable. People who bring forward complaints against teachers must be assured that their complaints are adequately and openly addressed. It is also important that teachers feel they have had a fair hearing and that no one is deliberately trying to undermine them. The Bill contains adequate safeguards. The investigating and disciplinary committees for which the Bill provides will be important.</P>
    <P>The welfare of teachers is often inadequately addressed. There are teachers who are under performing or are inadequate for a variety of reasons and who need support. It is important that a welfare provision for these teachers be made available. It is not good enough to tell these teachers to take early retirement. What are teachers to do when they have taken early retirement?</P>

      <P>Having received adequate counselling and support they should be able to come back as teachers. By the way, I see no reason teachers should not be allowed to teach until the age of 68, as they used do. Many teachers would gladly stay on to that age if they were able, although some cannot wait to get out of the profession.</P>
      <P>It may be time to look at our readiness to release teachers for specialised programmes. These programmes are important but the first area of importance is the chalk face of the classroom. If a principal is torn between placing a teacher in the classroom or on a specialised programme such as the home-school liaison link scheme, I would always opt for placing the teacher in the classroom.  </P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No one can doubt that our recent economic success, achieved above all through social partnership, has opened up fresh possibilities and thrown down new challenges for the State. Our society in the past had learned to tolerate poverty, disadvantage, poor health and inadequate housing. We had put up with glaring, persistent and institutionalised inequality because the majority believed that there was no alternative. We were taught that we were a poor country with few or no natural resources. A comprehensive assault on poverty and disadvantage was a utopian ambition which had no place in the daily reality of public life. The best the poor could hope for was goodwill, good works and the voluntary dedication of a few. It was a world where symptoms might be relieved, but their causes went untreated; where crime needs were met, if at all, as a matter of grace and favour, rather than as of right, of sporadic and inadequate benevolence, rather than a coherent and systematic effort to face up to the demands of basic justice.</P>
      <P>We no longer need to see ourselves that way today. We cannot plan for the future on such a traditional basis. This year alone the State's current account surplus is likely to exceed all the money we received in Structural Funds from Brussels in the previous six years. We are now a rich country and we are getting richer. We will soon be net contributors to an expanded European Union budget.</P>
      <P>It is in this light that we must again revisit our country's claim to its status as a true republic. For too long republicanism has been more synonymous with Nationalist rhetoric and verbiage than with any dedication to truly republican ideals. Over the decades we in the Labour Party have attempted to remain true to the republican and egalitarian vision of our founders, including most famously James Connolly. It is a vision which found its first formal expression on behalf of the new State, at the instigation and insistence of the Labour Party, in the democratic programme of the first Dáil. The programme asserted the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour and proclaimed that no child should suffer hunger or cold, from lack of food, clothing or shelter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Addressing the task of fulfilling aims such as these is the reason 80 years on we politicians, as successors of that generation, still gather in this building. It is the essence of our purpose and mandate as servants of the people to politicise society so that, acting collectively, we can deliver a future beyond individual ambition or achievement. There is, however, a view, growing in strength, which would confine politicians to servicing the needs of the economy, rather than the needs of the people. According to this view, the economy must be freed from political direction and left to find its own level. The only engine for <Col N="1068" /> dynamic change should be a free, lightly regulated market in which the citizen is valued only in proportion to his or her purchasing power. The regulation and supervision of business is denounced as &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;. Trade union recognition, calls for greater public provision and the like are decried as being inimical to sustained economic growth, which is not only an end in itself, it is the only legitimate and inevitable end. From such a broken linkage between the economy and politics comes a society which is characterised by fragmentation, alienation and the abandonment of politics.</P>
    <P>Our view of society is different. Our vision is at once national, determined to bring to fruition the ideals of the founders of the State, and international, encompassing an Ireland which strengthens and deepens its bonds with its partners in the European Union and the United Nations in the common implementation of a social market ideal. My party believes that a real republic is a country in which all citizens have the right, to the best of their ability, to participate in and contribute to the social, economic and cultural life of the nation with opportunities to develop their personal and social selves in conditions of freedom, solidarity, justice and equality. It is only in such circumstances that narrowly defined political rights such as access to political power by voting or standing for election can be made.</P>
    <P>We assert that a fully participative vision requires comprehensive provision of and universal access to the means to satisfy basic needs in income, health, housing, education and welfare. We reject an analysis which seeks to subordinate these social and economic rights and places formal political freedoms on a higher plain entitled to a greater degree of legal recognition and protection. Since our relationship with each other in a participatory and egalitarian society is enriched when cultural creativity is respected, we believe in a cultural rights policy which is democratic, participatory, open and committed to extensive public provision and access.</P>
    <P>In short, ours is a vision of society, not of its absence. It is rooted in the principle of equality of citizenship and adequate public provision which facilitates participation, inclusion, freedom, personal development and celebration as a matter of rights. This is the time we should be embarking on a fresh initiative at every level, constitutional, institutional, infrastructural, financial and legislative. Now that we can afford it, we have no excuse for not restating and reinforcing the republican and egalitarian ideals on which the State was founded. This is not to set course on a new direction, rather it is to return to our roots.</P>
    <P>This is the overall context in which my party proposes a constitutional guarantee of fundamental social, economic and cultural rights for every citizen. The Bill is just one of three constitutional amendment Bills my party has introduced in this Dáil session with the aim of improving the Constitution in the explicit recognition and protection of fundamental rights. The Bill proposes to <Col N="1069" /> amend Article 40 of the Constitution in order to provide for formal recognition of social, economic and cultural rights. Specifically, we propose the addition of a new paragraph 7 along the lines of the following three sentences:</P>
    <P>The State, bearing in mind international legal standards, recognises the economic, social and cultural rights of all persons and, in particular, recognises the right to earn a livelihood and to reasonable conditions of employment, the right to adequate health care and the right to an adequate standard of living, comprising adequate housing and nutrition and other means necessary to a dignified existence.</P>
    <P>Where practicable, the enjoyment of these rights should in the first place be ensured by individual and family effort and initiative.</P>
    <P>Where persons or their dependants are unable adequately to exercise or enjoy any of these rights, the State guarantees, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate these rights, in accordance with the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>Second, we are proposing a second amendment to Article 40, this time dealing with equality before the law. Our third proposal is to state and define a set of rights for children, independent of the collective rights of parents or the family unit.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that, although the subject matter of these constitutional amendments and the manner in which we have dealt with them is close to the Labour Party's heart and reflects our thinking, I do not believe we are seeking to subvert the Constitution in the service of a philosophy that is exclusive to just one system of political thought. No provision of our Constitution should go so far as to foist a system of political or philosophical belief on a dissident minority of any significant size. We have been down that road before. The tenets of the basic law should command universal assent and not give rise to party political controversy. In a constitutional democracy it is right and entirely legitimate that the electorate should be asked to choose between different and competing views. To the extent that they receive support, every political party should have the institutions of Government available to it to shape the national agenda according to its own mandate, unfettered by ideological hangovers left in place by previous Administrations.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about a programme of values in any way peculiar to the Labour Party. It is an argument for an agreed constitutional guarantee of a minimum level of universal entitlement to certain rights, with qualifications that relate to prevailing resources and standards. Constitutional recognition of these rights will not spell the end of the battle to secure their full enjoyment, or even the beginning of the end, nor will it render us redundant in our daily work. It is no more likely that, if the right to adequate housing is judicially recognised, the High Court will take over the nation's housing lists than, <Col N="1070" /> because the Constitution already recognises a right to primary education, the High Court would want to draw up the primary school curriculum. It will be for each generation to set and maintain its own standards.</P>
    <P>In the nature of things the recognition afforded by a constitution can only be at a basic level, with a wide margin of discretion left to the Executive and Legislature when it comes to the extent and quality of delivery. Therefore, my party is not calling on elected politicians to vote themselves out of their jobs, or even part of their jobs, in supporting this Bill. We are looking to strike a balance in the text of the Constitution, taken in its entirety. We want to give the people an opportunity to assert the values which they wish to claim as indicative of the national character, values grounded on imagination, generosity and empathy.</P>
    <P>As such I disagree with the argument made by the constitutional review group in 1996 in setting its face against any expanded provision in the Constitution for socio-economic rights. The majority of the group rejected the argument that the State should, as a counterweight to economic inequality, guarantee a general and legally enforceable right to freedom from poverty and social exclusion. I prefer the arguments of the minority members of that expert group. I believe, as I have made clear, in the merits of social cohesion and social inclusion. A false dichotomy is made between civil and political rights, such as the right to vote and to stand for election, which are regarded as basic and requiring constitutional recognition, and the social and economic rights which I have listed. In any event, our Constitution already recognises some rights of a socio-economic nature and these are being enforced by the courts. Recent cases involving rights to education and appropriate care only serve to illustrate this point.</P>
    <P>Of course, socio-economic rights, no more than any other class of right, should not be framed so as to be absolute or open-ended in nature. Nor should the Government or the Oireachtas be entirely robbed of discretion as to the manner in which rights are vindicated in practice. Our text takes account of these practical realities. That is why I repeat again that this set of Bills is just one aspect of my party's overall approach and just one of a wider set of proposals. I would not believe the Labour Party's work was done if these amendments were accepted by the people at referendum. Their implementation will remain a constant task for this and future generations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a wider argument about the philosophical vision according to which this country should be governed. These proposed changes to the constitutional framework do not encapsulate the argument in its entirety, but the debate should shine a light on some aspects and should highlight the approach of individuals and parties in this House. For example, according to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 October:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> Fianna Fáil's republicanism does not begin and end at national liberty, i.e., self-determination and independence. Its republicanism embraces the ideals of the French Revolution. Fianna Fáil believes in a society where all citizens have equal opportunity and equal access. We believe the State is the guarantor of these rights and liberties and with these rights come responsibilities to our fellow citizens and society as a whole.</P>
    <P>So, if Fianna Fáil and the Government as a whole does indeed wish to see the State act as guarantor of the rights and liberties of the citizen, we are entitled to expect at least sympathetic consideration of our approach this evening, and I await the positive response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are concentrating on one particular proposition, that our fellow citizens live, move and have their being in, and are shaped by, a world of social and economic forces as well as purely political interactions, and that socio-economic rights deserve a place in the constitutional scheme of things alongside civil and political rights. It is argued that the recognition of these rights in a legal framework would be expensive and that the cost cannot be quantified. We have heard this sort of argument before. For example, almost a year ago, the Department of Finance under Deputy McCreevy gave its reaction to the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. This reaction was included in a report, Towards Equal Citizenship, published in December 1999 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The commission had recommended that every disabled person be given a &ldquo;statement of needs&rdquo; which would entitle them to services without having to argue their case again and again with numerous Departments, health boards and agencies. Disability interest groups had been campaigning for years for the establishment of a legal right to services. The response of the Department was forthright:</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance cannot accept these recommendations, which imply the underpinning by law of access to, and provision of, services for people with disabilities as a right. This right, if given a statutory basis, would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer and could lead to requests from other persons seeking access to health and other services without regard to the eventual cost of providing these services.</P>
    <P>That this argument should be made at this time of plenty is regrettable, but its philosophical basis is also fundamentally flawed. The availability of resources may affect the time at which we are in a position to vindicate a right, and our amendment accepts that this issue arises. It does not, however, determine nor should it determine the very existence of a right. My party's views is that that should be a matter for the people. If we accept a <Col N="1072" /> right exists, we should prepare to vindicate it as resources allow. To deny it exists has meant, in this society at least, the treatment of some of our citizens in a less than satisfactory manner. That much at least has been revealed in recent years about our society since Independence, to our cost.</P>
    <P>For example, while the State pretended to be concerned about homeless children the truth was that it merely collected them, institutionalised them and then ignored their plight. The public purse is now faced with the cost of those decades of child neglect and child abuse in the various institutions. It is far cheaper, in the long run, to get things right the first time round.</P>
    <P>Essentially, when it comes to meeting minimum standards of provision of universal entitlement, there are costs which must be recognised as having a prior claim &ndash; moral, social and legal &ndash; on our collective resources. We are not alone in that opinion. Throughout Europe, both in the settled democracies of the west, in the newly established democracies of central and eastern Europe and across the rest of the world, the written constitution, which sets out basic structures and normative values that underpin all other legislation and public activity, is seen as the place where a strong commitment to respect for social and economic rights should be made. For example, Article 2 of the Swedish Constitution provides:</P>
    <P>(1) Public power shall be exercised with respect for the equal worth of all and for the freedom and dignity of the individual.</P>
    <P>(2) The personal, economic and cultural welfare of the individual shall be fundamental aims of public activity. In particular, it shall be incumbent upon the public administration to secure the right to work, housing and education and to promote social care and social security and a good living environment.</P>
    <P>The Polish Constitution states that a minimum level of remuneration for work, or the manner of setting its levels, shall be specified by statute; that public authorities shall pursue policies aiming at full, productive employment by implementing programmes to combat unemployment; that everyone shall have the right to safe and hygienic conditions of work; and that citizens have the right to social security. It also protects the right to health protection and of equal access to health care services.</P>
    <P>Article 25 of the Japanese Constitution states:</P>
    <P>All people shall have the right to maintain the minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living. In all spheres of life, the State shall use its endeavours for the promotion and extension of social welfare and security, and of public health.</P>
    <P>More extensively, in Finland, sections 18 to 20 of the Constitution stipulate:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> . . . everyone has the right to earn his or her livelihood by the employment, occupation or commercial activity of his or her choice . . . the public authorities shall take responsibility for the protection of the labour force and shall promote employment and shall work towards guaranteeing for everyone the right to work .  . . those who cannot obtain the means necessary for a life of dignity have the right to receive indispensable subsistence and care . . . everyone shall be guaranteed the right to basic subsistence in the event of unemployment, illness, and disability and during old age, as well as at the birth of a child or the loss of a provider . . . the public authorities shall guarantee for everyone adequate social, health and medical services and shall promote the health of the population . . . the public authorities shall promote the right of everyone to housing and the opportunity to arrange their own housing.</P>
    <P>The Belgian Constitution has similar provisions while Switzerland has similar sets of rights.</P>
    <P>As well as at domestic level, there has also been activity on the international stage. The European Social Charter was drawn up by the Council of Europe in 1961. Ireland signed the charter in that year and ratified it in 1964. The original charter guarantees 19 fundamental social and economic rights, of which seven are regarded as particularly significant, namely, the right to work, the right to organise, the right to bargain collectively, the right to social security, the right to social and medical assistance, the right to the social, legal and economic protection of the family, and the right to protection and assistance for migrant workers and their families.</P>
    <P>There has been greater development at EU level. In December 1989, the Heads of State and Government of 11 member states &ndash; the UK opted out &ndash; adopted the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, or, as it was commonly known, the social charter. This document is based on the Council of Europe's original Social Charter and on ILO conventions. It lays down a range of social rights that are to be guaranteed in the European labour market.</P>
    <P>At first, the social charter had only moral, not legal force. Subsequently, and because the Conservative Government in Britain strongly opposed any increase of the Community power in the social policy field, the other 11 member states concluded an agreement on social policy, by way of an annex to the treaty of the European Union. Ultimately, the Labour Party victory in the British general election of 1997 marked a shift in that country's attitude toward social policy. As a result, the objectives of the agreement on social policy were introduced into the body of the Treaty of Amsterdam and, following the ratification of that Treaty by all member states, future social policy legislation is applicable to all member states, including the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the importance attached to the concept that, in the context of enlargement, the European Commission has specifically <Col N="1074" /> included economic and social rights in its assessment of the fulfilment of the so-called Copenhagen criteria by the ten candidate countries who seek to be members of the EU. The opinions delivered by the Commission on readiness for membership consider whether these countries have adhered to the European Social Charter.</P>
    <P>Given this, it is surprising that some within the EU are concerned about the new proposed draft Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly as the charter only applies to Union law. I understand two such concerns were expressed by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy O'Kennedy. Those who make this argument still fail to see there is an urgent need to inculcate some sense of common ownership of, and participation in, the European project. The lack of openness, transparency or accountability in its operations means that, to most citizens, Europe and its workings are unfathomable. This incomprehension will lead to further misunderstanding, distrust and alienation. An increasing number of citizens of the Union do not care. In this light, a commitment to the rule of law and a commitment to respect for and maintenance of fundamental rights is an essential precondition to any further development at the European level. Any such regime will include recognition of social, economic and cultural rights, as the draft charter does.</P>
    <P>Our starting point in this debate is an attitude to the role and function of the Constitution which was asserted also by the Commission on Justice and Peace in its document Re-Righting the Constitution. It states:</P>
    <P>The Constitution is much more than a neutral set of operating instructions to regulate the technical functioning of the State. It represents a privileged source and statement of values, both in the State and in the wider society from which the State arises.</P>
    <P>The history of the last century is about the vindication of liberal political rights. Now more than ever, democracy stands triumphant as a political system. Some have suggested that we have accordingly reached the end of history. I, however, hold to the view of the UN Commissioner on Human Rights who has suggested that this century's crusade must be to end the rampant social division that divides our planet. As is always the case, there is no better place to start than at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of the most important legislative initiatives the Labour Party has taken in recent years. It is also one of the most significant Bills to have been introduced to the 29th Dáil. I hope the Government parties will treat it with the seriousness it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution has, with some exceptions, served us fairly well, but it is a product of the era in which it was drafted. Those who drafted it could hardly have envisaged the kind of changes we have experienced over the past 60 years. The Constitution was drafted at a time <Col N="1075" /> when Ireland was still living in the shadow of the Civil War that had ended less than 15 years earlier. It was a very poor, predominantly agricultural country with a rather narrow, inward looking society. It is no surprise then that the Constitution still reflects many of the attitudes and aspirations of the 1930s.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, was of the opinion that the Constitution should be changed at least every 25 years as our society develops into a modern State. In fact, the Constitution has been changed very little. Several of the amendments passed in referenda arose from our membership of the European Union. There have been a number of progressive changes, such as the reduction in the voting age. The final removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce was a belated recognition of the reality that putting something in the Constitution does not prevent marriages from breaking down.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have ducked the issue of reform of the Constitution. Seán Lemass established a committee to review the Constitution which produced a widely praised report in 1968 but, unfortunately, nothing was done to implement its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government of the Rainbow Government, produced in December 1994, provided for the appointment of an expert group, chaired by Dr. T.K. Whittaker, to report on all aspects of the Constitution. The group produced its report in due course and, in accordance with the commitment given by the Rainbow Government, it was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution. I suspect that the response of the Government may be to say that it is premature to make a decision on a matter like this and that it should be left to the Oireachtas committee. This proposition is of such urgency, however, that it should not be delayed any further. The Oireachtas committee was already dealing with many difficult issues. Indeed, whenever the Government has a tricky political problem, it kicks it away to the Oireachtas committee. Nobody can say with any certainty when the committee will be able to complete the comprehensive task given to it.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that when the current intergovernmental conference concludes its consideration of proposed EU reforms, a constitutional amendment will almost certainly be required. We are already committed to holding a referendum next year to ratify the Rome statute of the international criminal court. The opportunity presented by these referenda should be used to put this proposed constitutional amendment on social and economic rights before the people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn pointed out, this Bill is just one of a package of constitutional reforms the Labour Party has produced. We can only debate one Bill at a time but in addition to this proposal, we also have Bills providing for an amendment to guarantee equality before the law and to <Col N="1076" /> specifically outlaw discrimination on a range of grounds. We also have a Bill to enshrine the rights of children in the Constitution. While acknowledging the need for wider constitutional reform, I would like to see this package of measures put before the people at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Constitution was drafted in very different political, social and economic circumstances. The rights of property, reflecting the ethos of the time, are strongly asserted in the Constitution and this right has been cited by successive Governments as the reason nothing has been done to abolish the feudal and anachronistic system of ground rents. While the Constitution set out, in Article 45, some impressive sounding principles for social policy, it specified that these principles &ldquo;shall not be recognisable by any Court under any provision of this Constitution&rdquo;. Therefore, while rights such as the right to private property and indeed the right to personal liberty, could be vindicated by the courts, social rights generally could not. That imbalance should now be addressed.</P>
    <P>The economic picture has changed dramatically since the 1930s. Indeed, the economic picture has changed enormously in the past decade. It may well have been that the authors of the Constitution feared that putting enforcement of social rights into the Constitution might place a crippling economic burden on a new and underdeveloped State, but that argument no longer applies. We are experiencing a period of unprecedented economic growth. The State coffers are awash with money. We will have a multi-billion pound budget surplus at the end of this year and having benefited from a huge inflow of cash from the European Union, we will soon become a net contributor. Objectives that would have been difficult to achieve only ten years ago, and which would have sounded positively Utopian in the 1930s, are now entirely feasible and achievable, yet every political representative in this House will know from their own experience that many people have not benefited from the economic boom. One cannot walk more than a few hundred yards from this House without encountering people sleeping in doorways.</P>
    <P>People are finding it more difficult than ever to buy a home or to qualify for local authority housing. All housing should be affordable, of a good standard and provide security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The gap in the speed and quality of health service available to private and public patients grows ever wider. Hospital waiting lists show no sign of decreasing and waiting for up to eight months for a simple cataract operation, for example, is now the norm.</P>
    <P>The courts have highlighted the glaring shortcomings in areas like educational opportunities for those with disabilities and treatment of disturbed children. Child poverty here is the second highest in Europe, affecting between a quarter and a third of Irish children. Every child should have the right to education which should be directed to the development of the child's talents <Col N="1077" /> and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity to make a new start by inserting into our Constitution a specific commitment that we, as a society, will meet certain basic commitments in regard to social and economic rights for all our citizens. The Labour Party is not alone in advocating a constitutional amendment along these lines. Many organisations and groups involved in the welfare of the disadvantaged have urged this course of action. The Commission on Justice and Peace of the Catholic Bishops Conference has produced a well argued and thoughtful document making the case for an amendment. The former President of the High Court, Mr. Declan Costello, who is also a former Attorney General, said in November 1998 that the Constitution should be amended to guarantee explicitly the social and economic rights of the underprivileged. Noting that the courts had enhanced protection of the basic rights included in the Constitution he stated: &ldquo;There is no reason to assume that the enjoyment of the economic and social rights of the underprivileged and deprived would not be likewise enhanced if they too were constitutionally protected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The period of unprecedented economic growth offers us challenges as well as opportunities. Most of all, we now have to decide the direction we want Irish society to take. Do we want to continue with a situation where a minority do exceptionally well, the bulk of people largely stand still and a growing minority are left further behind or do we want to create a truly fair and egalitarian society where everyone will have an equal opportunity and a fair deal? I have no doubt that the majority of people would opt for the latter course and that they would vote for the amendment we are now proposing if they are given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the State to eliminate the causes of poverty and to ensure equality by creating opportunities for the redistribution of our vast wealth. This work should not be left to community and voluntary bodies who are currently doing much of what the State should be doing. It is for this reason that we bring forward the Bill this evening to ensure that all our citizens can be assured of their social and economic rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The stated intention behind this Bill is to amend the fundamental rights provisions in Article 40 of the Constitution so as to provide for the recognition, defence and vindication of social, economic and cultural rights. <Col N="1078" /> Specific rights in these areas, such as those relating to health, nutrition and an adequate standard of living, are specifically referred to in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government fully understands the motivation and purpose at the heart of the Bill. The central issue, however, is whether the rights included in the Bill should be set out in the particular section of the Constitution that is identified in the Bill. The Government does not believe that it is right to do so because the delicate balance which the Constitution achieves in the area of what might be termed fundamental and human rights, which may also be classified as civil and political rights on the one hand and economic, social and cultural rights on the other, would be seriously disturbed by such a development. This is no arbitrary distinction. It is one that is also reflected in several international rights instruments which apply to this area to which Ireland is a party and in respect of which it takes its responsibilities very seriously.</P>
      <P>The type of rights identified in the Bill are loosely based on rights contained in the 1966 UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which entered into force in January 1976. Ireland signed the convention in October 1973 and ratified it in December 1989. It came into force for Ireland in March 1990. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 16 and 17 of the covenant, Ireland submits detailed periodic reports to the Secretary General of the United Nations for consideration by the relevant UN committee on the measures it has adopted and the progress it has made in achieving the observance of the rights recognised therein. The first such report was published in September 1997 and was examined by the committee in May 1999. The second comprehensive report which was published earlier this year has yet to be considered by the committee.</P>
      <P>In so far as the committee's suggestions and recommendations on the first report are concerned, it is of particular interest to note that it raised the question of incorporation of the rights contained in the convention in the Constitution. The Bill now before the House reflects to some extent the UN committee's wishes in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preamble to the covenant recognises the distinction between the rights that it embraces and the rights of a higher order which may be classified as human rights or rights of a civil and political nature. In terms of the Constitution, this internationally accepted difference in the classification of rights is reflected in the Fundamental Rights Articles 40 to 44 and the Directive Principles of Social Policy in Article 45. This latter article contains the type of rights in the social policy area which are covered in the covenant. Article 45 commences by stating that its provisions merely lay down general guidance for the Legislature and do not provide the basis for striking down laws for being unconstitutional. Not alone are the courts forbidden from striking down laws on the grounds of inconsistency with these provisions, but the provisions themselves are <Col N="1079" /> decreed as non-cognisable by any court. That is the problem behind the approach adopted by the Labour Party in bringing forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the 1996 report of the Constitution Review Group. It examined this area in great detail and a majority of the group agreed with the overall position that the Constitution should not be amended to include rights of the type now in question. The main reason, as it is stated in that report, why the Constitution should not confer personal rights to freedom from poverty or to other economic or social entitlements is that these are essentially political matters which, in a democracy, it should be the responsibility of the elected members of the people to address and determine. The report also stated that it would be a distortion of democracy to transfer decisions on major issues of policy and practicality from the Government and the Oireachtas, which are elected to represent the people and to do their will, to an unelected Judiciary.</P>
    <P>This point is further illustrated in the report by reference to the solving of economic and social problems being an integral part of any political agenda, but that the degree to which a solution can be sought or found must depend on the resources which the community is prepared to make available at any given time. It would not, in the view of the group, accord with democratic principles to confer absolute personal rights in the Constitution in relation to economic or social objectives, however desirable in themselves, and leave the Oireachtas with no option but to discharge the cost, whatever it might be, as determined by the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Constitution Review Group did, on balance, favour an amendment of Article 40.3 of the Constitution which would provide a comprehensive list of fundamental rights specifically encompassing the personal rights identified by the courts to date and which might also include those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, which in accordance with a recent decision of the Government is to be incorporated into our law by means of legislation, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, so far as may be considered appropriate, but not, significantly, those in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that to incorporate these rights in the Constitution in the precise manner that the Bill now before the House proposes, that is, by means of a blanket amendment to Article 40.3, would be the wrong course to follow. This is because the Government views social and economic policy as primarily and ultimately the prerogative of democratically elected and accountable politicians, whether they sit in the Executive or the Legislature. A transfer of these powers to an unelected Judiciary is not warranted and it would disturb the delicate checks and balances owed by the three independent pillars of <Col N="1080" /> State to each other. The right to earn a livelihood, one of the rights proposed for inclusion in the Constitution by the Bill, is already one of the unenumerated personal rights in Article 40 which has already been identified by the courts.</P>
    <P>No one should be allowed to fall below the minimum standard of subsistence so as to suffer from a lack of food, shelter or clothing. As the Constitution Review Group states, if this should ever happen, despite the social welfare system, the Constitution appears to offer ultimate protection through judicial vindication of fundamental personal rights such as the right to life and the right to bodily integrity.</P>
    <P>In so far as the particular rights sought to be included in the Constitution by the Bill are concerned, the Constitution Review Group made certain positive recommendations for selective constitutional reform, particularly in relation to some of the substantive rights guaranteed by the covenant, for example, in a proposed redraft of Article 40.1 that poverty would be included as a ground on which discrimination would be prohibited, the right to work and earn a livelihood, which, as I have already mentioned, is one of the unenumerated rights contained in the Constitution, to be inserted in Article 40.3 and, in a redrafting of Article 45, the right to just and favourable working conditions, as well as the right to an adequate standard of living including food, clothing, housing and the continuous improvement of living conditions to be included as non-justiciable rights.</P>
    <P>Those recommendations will be considered in due course by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and by the Government at the end of that process. In the meantime, the Government will continue to ensure that in keeping with the overall requirements of budgetary policy, issues of particular concern to the social partners in this area will be dealt with through the partnership approach, taking into account the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has a proud record not just in terms of the protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens but in the interpretation of the articles relevant to human rights. That has been one of the outstanding features of democratic life in this State since its foundation. It should give people great grounds for celebration. Many democratic countries throughout the world have recognised the rights which have been established following an interpretation of our 1937 Constitution by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In this context it is also of note that Ireland is about to incorporate into its domestic laws the European Convention on Human Rights. It has been argued by many academic lawyers and in this House that the rights which have been enumerated over the years by our Supreme Court might be more expansive than the rights enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights. This is an arguable point. However, all those interested in the protection of human rights will be pleased that we are about to incorporate <Col N="1081" /> the convention into our domestic laws. People will welcome the fact that we will have a Human Rights Commission as a watchdog in respect of human rights in this jurisdiction in the near future. The House will be aware that Mr. Justice Donal Barrington has been appointed as president of the commission. I anticipate that we will announce the names of the other members of the commission at an early date.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party for putting forward this legislation. It is timely that we have a debate on this issue, particularly on the cusp of the new millennium. I look forward to a fruitful discussion in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Private Members' Bill before the House refers to the right to, among other things, adequate health care. The eligibility system currently in place for health services and the ongoing extensions to it provide a firm statutory basis for entitlements to health services. The Government's approach has been to greatly expand and develop the range of services available and to do this in a practical way by putting additional services in place rather than engaging in flights of political fancy, as reflected in the Bill.</P>
      <P>At present, medical card holders are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled, subject to certain modest charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services, including consultant services. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
      <P>For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain, without charge, the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his-her dependants do not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
      <P>These are the fundamentals of our eligibility system. However, the Government has recognised that any such system must be monitored to ensure it addresses changing needs. It is for this reason that, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government identified the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families, and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three-year period, began on 1 March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The latest agreement between the Government and the social partners, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
    <P>The existence of a robust eligibility framework is a fundamental element in the provision of the health care services required by our population. It is, however, only one element. As is acknowledged worldwide, the provision of health services is an immensely complex process. This Government is supporting our eligibility system with an unprecedented level of resources and a wide range of strategies and programmes across a whole range of health care areas. I regard my role as Minister as measuring the real need for additional services, taking account of public expectations, as well as the expert view, and trying, as a member of the Government, to bridge the gap between current provisions and what is needed as speedily and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>Inevitably the resources available for health care are finite, despite the substantial increase in year-on-year investment in the health sector. That the health sector has done well relative to financial investment is not in doubt. However, I am conscious that from another, equally valid, perspective there remain key areas of unmet need that require investment on an urgent basis. For example, areas such as services for older people, services for people with a disability, the young chronic sick, child care services and issues relating to bed capacity and manpower in the acute hospital services. The Government acknowledges that more needs to be done in all these areas. It has a strong record of investment in the health system and is committed to continuing this trend in 2001.</P>
    <P>The £2 billion earmarked for health in the national development plan represents a trebling of capital investment compared to the previous seven year period. The development plan investment will enable substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure and equipping of acute hospitals, and in facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, the elderly, the mentally ill and children in need of care and protection. The plan also provides for investment in health centres and information technology. By making the commitment of £1 billion each to our acute hospitals infrastructure and non-acute community care infrastructure, we have redressed an imbalance in spending between these two areas which should significantly improve the non-acute and community care services.</P>
    <P>The Government has delivered a major programme of phased investment in services for people with intellectual disability and autism. This has involved expenditure of over £127 million in capital and revenue up to the end of this <Col N="1083" /> year. Many of the problems faced by persons with disabilities in accessing appropriate support services arise as a result of a lack of investment in these services in the past. We will continue our phased programme of investment in services for people with intellectual disability and autism. There will also be major developments for persons with physical and sensory disability &ndash; more community residential and day care places and regional assessment centres will be provided.</P>
    <P>A series of key strategy documents have been launched over recent years aimed at addressing the major causes of premature death and illness. These include a comprehensive cardiovascular strategy to improve heart health, for which we have provided substantial funds to commence the implementation process in 2000. The strategy will also focus on intersectoral collaboration to address the broader determinants of heath status which lie outside the health services.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increased levels of investment, such as those provided over recent years, the existing health care system can deliver a quality service. The volume of care delivered continues to increase year on year. For example, there were 827,000 discharges, including in-patient and day care, in the acute hospital system in 1999. This represents an increase of about 2.4% over 1998 levels. Day cases increased by 9.64% and almost one million procedures were carried out on these patients.</P>
    <P>In addition, the complexity of the cases dealt with has also increased. For example, since 1996 there has been a 17% volume increase in the most expensive procedures. There were an estimated two million out-patient attendances in 1999 and there were more than 1.2 million attendances at accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The latest waiting list figures show a significant decrease and we are continuing to allocate additional funds to improve the waiting list initiative. The Government has taken a number of significant initiatives in the acute hospital sector to ensure that services are reformed, re-organised and properly geared towards the needs of the population. We dealt with specific initiatives, including the national cancer strategy, the development of renal services, the establishment of the Medical Manpower Forum and the development of a new hospital accreditation programme, all of which will improve the governance, management and quality of our health services.</P>
    <P>One of our key tasks is the need to review the whole area of hospital bed capacity. Deputies will be aware that the Government is committed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to a review of bed capacity in the acute and non-acute settings. This review is being processed and is expected to be completed in spring of next year. The review is of critical importance in the context of assessing the capacity of the hospital system to manage periodic surges in emergency admissions <Col N="1084" /> and the reduction of waiting times for elective treatment.</P>
    <P>The assessment of existing and future capacity will have regard to a number of fundamental principles which need to underpin the future provision of services. These include equitable access to care for public patients, availability of prompt treatment within a reasonable period, the provision of the most appropriate form of care in the correct setting, the organisation and delivery of a patient-centred and flexible service, the comprehensive integration of services across traditional boundaries and a strong emphasis on the measurement of outcomes and the appropriateness of treatment. We are developing and improving services across the system and making additional investment available.</P>
    <P>Our current health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, was devised in 1994 and has provided the framework within which most policy and service development has taken place over the past six years. There is general agreement that the strategy has served us well. However, it is now time to consider how we envisage the health services developing over the next five to seven years and the new strategy can be expected to set out our new health goals and how we intend to pursue them.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, I see the task under three main headings. The first concerns modernisation, reform and change, addressing the measures we need to put in place to deliver a patient-centred service which is safe, up to the required standard of quality and delivered on time and on the basis of need. The second will analyse service development needs and prioritise areas for new investment. The third will be concerned with the positioning of the strategic partnership for change and development as an explicit element of the managing process. I am committed to the idea of seeking to define and develop a new vision for health which will be built on the perspective and opinions of the many stakeholders involved &ndash; the patient or client, service providers, professionals in all disciplines, management and unions.</P>
    <P>I see the way forward for health care in terms of determining the real needs and producing the strategies and resources to meet those needs and to provide effectively for our people. That is the most tangible and effective way we can make progress in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline yet again to the House the main features of the Government's approach to housing and the degree to which the Government's measures are yielding positive results, my primary concern in this debate is the nature of the Bill before the House. A damaging illusion underlies this Bill. The Labour Party is attempting to sell the fiction that real social and economic needs can, in some magical way, be met through <Col N="1085" /> enshrining rights in the Constitution. Lofty sentiments are one thing, meeting real needs in a practical way is quite a different matter.</P>
      <P>What does the Labour Party hope to achieve by this approach? Does this House uphold the view that decisions on health and housing policy should be removed from the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government and the Oireachtas, directly elected by the people and with a mandate to pursue certain policies, not best placed to make democratic decisions on such significant issues of policy and the appropriate allocation of resources to underpin those policies? The Constitution Review Group examined the arguments in favour of the inclusion of specific personal economic rights in the Constitution and concluded against their inclusion. Its reasoning was quite straightforward, that &ldquo;the solving of economic and social problems is an integral element of any political agenda but the degree to which a solution can be sought or found must depend on the resources which the community is prepared to make available at any given time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for ensuring that the citizens have adequate housing at a price or rent which they can afford, rests properly with the Government, the elected representatives of the people. The Government has demonstrated its willingness to accept that responsibility. We have consistently put housing at the top of our agenda. We never underestimated the scale of the challenge we faced. We have taken decisive action and will continue to do so. We wasted no time in addressing the gap between supply and demand for housing and our response to overall housing needs forms a coherent, planned and strategic response, and there are very welcome signs that we are now turning the corner.</P>
      <P>What really matters are not words and theoretical proposals, but action to deliver the increased housing our population needs, and this Government has delivered. Last year's record housing output of over 46,500 new houses will be exceeded this year. The latest leading indicators of housing supply, coupled with progress being made on the <i>Action on Housing</i> initiatives announced in June, suggest that we are on target to achieve 50,000 housing completions this year and further increases in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the <i>Action on Housing</i> supply measures is being pursued urgently. Concrete action has been taken to ensure that the housing supply measures are driven and co-ordinated effectively to bring forward land for housing more quickly. We have introduced incentives to guarantee an ongoing supply of serviced housing land. Action has been taken to deal effectively with planning and infrastructural constraints in order to maximise the potential of available land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting the maximum benefit from the supply <Col N="1086" /> of building land is a key element of the Government's strategy and increased density is crucial to achieving this. We have introduced planning guidelines to increase residential density in appropriate locations. Significant advances are being made in achieving a balanced distribution of population and economic activity in the future through strategic and spatial planning. We have rebalanced the rates of stamp duties to improve the affordability of reasonably priced second hand houses for first time purchasers and prevent investors pricing first time buyers out of the market.</P>
    <P>The most recent house price figures available for the September quarter provide strong evidence of a moderation in the rate of house price increase, particularly new house prices. House price inflation in the new house market is currently showing a 12 month increase of 10% in Dublin and 12% nationwide, the lowest increases since 1995. It is generally accepted by most reasonable commentators that the Government's actions have played a key role in achieving a slowdown in the rate of house price increase &ndash; a very positive achievement against the background of continued economic growth and low interest rates. Sustained increases in housing output and reduced investor activity are the key factors underlying this moderation.</P>
    <P>There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market as the targeted tax measures to curb speculative investment take effect. Survey data available to my Department indicate that the first time buyers' share of the £100,000-£150,000 housing market has grown from 38% to 44% nationally since July. Most importantly, we have significantly expanded the social housing programmes with unprecedented and guaranteed funding of more than £7 billion over the period of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The range and extent of measures implemented by the State, and improved significantly by this Government, to provide housing for those unable to access housing from their own resources demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that housing needs are adequately addressed. The Government provided for an increase of 60% in Exchequer expenditure on local authority and social housing programmes this year compared with last year. This is by any standards a remarkable level of increase and ensures that there is no financial constraint on the delivery of the maximum amount of social housing. In 2000, the Government has provided increased Exchequer funding for local authority and social housing programmes. This figure represents a 133% increase over the figure provided in 1997 by the previous Government and reflects the priority we afford to meeting social housing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided for 25,000 local authority housing starts between this year and the end of 2003. We have created the conditions whereby the voluntary housing sector will be able to deliver over 15,000 additional housing units over the national development plan period. We have introduced new arrangements to prevent and comprehensively address homelessness. We are committed to resourcing local authorities to allow them to implement their five year Traveller accommodation programmes. My target is to expand overall social housing output through the range of local authority and voluntary housing programmes to meet the needs of over 15,000 households per annum over the next few years compared to 9,200 last year.</P>
      <P>In considering the progress that has been made on housing, it is also necessary to point out that many measures already taken have yet to have full effect. This is a crucial point: there is a significant lead-in time to achieving results where construction is concerned, especially with the construction industry operating at full capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, institutional change cannot deliver results overnight. The effects of our landmark policy under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to enable local authorities to reserve up to 20% of land intended for residential development for social and affordable housing have yet to be felt. The same goes for the Act's provisions which streamline the planning process. These include the use of strategic development zones to ensure the early development of large scale residential developments, with a land holding levy for land owners who do not develop the land within specified time frames. These measures, as the House will be aware, have received the imprimatur of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Our approach to housing, therefore, has been very much action oriented. We have kept housing under careful review and have refined our strategies as necessary.</P>

    <P>Fine Gael welcomes this debate and will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage. I want to set out briefly the Fine Gael perspective on this. The Constitution is not a rigid rule book of how everybody should live or how Governments should perform. It represents a set of values and a vision of society. In fairness, on the tour of other European countries he gave us, Deputy Quinn <Col N="1089" /> showed how it is possible to have day to day public administration which must deal with fiscal issues and at the same time have a vision of the rights of a type of society. That is worthy of support, but it is totally inconsistent of the Minister to stand up and say &ldquo;No, we could not possibly have this&rdquo; and at the same time say that the European Social Charter already conveys these rights. It is totally inconsistent for Ministers to say we could not possibly have this, while at the same time they say the UN charter and the European social charter already convey these rights. If one listened to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one could argue that these rights are already there. I think he said that the Constitution goes further. If one takes the case of the autistic child last week&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if one takes the case of the autistic child last week, one could argue that these rights are already there. The Ministers cannot argue that they are in favour of giving these rights when they are opposed to this Bill.</P>
      <P>While we would like to see this Bill go to committee for a proper analysis, there are two things about which the Fine Gael Party is concerned. We do not object to promoting greater fairness but we do not want to see further marginalisation of politics and politicians. The partnership process has already marginalised people in this House in that the public are not satisfied to leave it to once every four or five years to vote in a Government, they now want a more inclusive process. If politics becomes more judicial, which is not the intention of this Bill, it would further marginalise the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There is a need for debate about the existing law and whether we need to enshrine greater rights of equality in it. There is a very strong case to be made for children and the greater protection for children <i>vis-à-vis</i> these rights in the Constitution. We look forward to this legislation advancing to Committee Stage and to being teased out. These are the types of issues that should be before the committee and not just the issue of abortion for instance. The agenda seems to have been narrowed down to a one item agenda in many respects in terms of public interest. Whatever poverty exists in our society, we owe it to the next generation to aspire to move out of that cycle of poverty and not to regenerate it. We must make sure everybody has the opportunity to live life with the maximum level of dignity and rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the rights vindicated in this proposal is the right to housing. It is quite appalling that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, can run in and out of this House and be so oblivious to reality. Instead of the complacent self-congratulatory rhetoric that we hear from him and the senior Minister in his Department, we should acknowledge the reality which is that there are 45,000 applicants for local authority and voluntary hous<Col N="1090" /> ing. We have people who are living in substandard rented accommodation without security of tenure. We have lone parents and others living in mobile homes. We have three generations of a family in one house, under the one roof, in very overcrowded conditions. We have people whose health is affected by the standard of accommodation in which they live. Their prospect of getting houses has diminished in the period of office of this Government.</P>
    <P>There is no point quoting statistics relating to extra money when house prices have gone through the roof. The reality is that last year, this Government said 4,500 local authority houses would be built and that the goal was 45,000, which means ten years to clear the waiting list. However, only 2,900 houses were built by local authorities, and that is not all. One can walk any street outside this House and see people huddling in sleeping bags. If one meets Focus Ireland, one will know there are solutions to this problem. It is not rocket science to give someone adequate shelter for the night and to have transient accommodation facilities where their addiction problems and their bodily needs can be met. This has been done in other countries and needs to be done here. I cannot understand with the type of budgetary surpluses we have, how there is no proper contractual relationship with Focus Ireland and the excellent voluntary groups to provide the multi-faceted support needed for homeless people.</P>
    <P>One does not have to go far to come across something I notice is not debated among urban TDs. In my constituency, I am ashamed to say, I know of elderly people who, or whose father before them, bought out their houses, vested in county council cottages, and they do not have toilet facilities. If one goes through the files of applications in every health board under the special housing aids for the elderly scheme &ndash; which only gets a paltry £8 million even though it is an excellent scheme &ndash; one will see that instead of these people getting grants, teams coming in and doing the work, they are applying to repair collapsing and leaking roofs and are living on an £80 or £90 per week old age pension. They cannot afford to carry out the repairs or to provide bathroom facilities at this time of plenty.</P>
    <P>What we have is a paralysis of analysis. The three Bacon reports said that if one alters the temperature in a room, one changes the heating. It is as superficial as that. It has made things worse. It has affected investment in the private rented sector. Rents have risen by 120% in the past 20 months. There is a real crisis in that sector and yet we have no solutions. The NESF report said there should be a target to clear 70% of waiting lists for local authority housing. Yet we have the same nonsense and a little bit of progress on the supply side but not enough. We need 60,000 new houses a year or half a million new houses if one considers that household formation size has gone down from 3.3 to 2.8 people per household, the growth in the work force the returned emi<Col N="1091" /> grants and the migration patterns to the eastern part of the country. That is the reality. Yet one-third of all posts for planners cannot be filled. Local authorities are writing to people for further particulars because they cannot make a decision as there is not enough staff.</P>
    <P>When I ask builders why they are not building houses, they say there are no water and sanitary services. The State has the monopoly on that. It takes ten to 12 years from the preliminary approval to the report, the design, the bill of quantities, contract documents, the tender and the construction to build a sewerage scheme. There is no integration of the contractual process. Deputies opposite should not congratulate themselves and decry other Members of this House who are trying to cut through the waffle and enshrine rights for people through the courts because of the failure of this Government to deliver.</P>
    <P>The net point of this debate or the reason this proposal has been put forward is because of the policy failures of this Government. Since we do not have a decent health service, rights, decent welfare and housing, people are seeking to enshrine that right in law to oblige the Government to provide it. That is the point to this debate. What is needed is a twin response &ndash; a committee of this House to look at this legislation and at the appropriate international norm of a social vision and set of values to which we should aspire in our Constitution, notwithstanding our economic position at any time. Deputy Quinn clearly articulated the right and the vindication of that right. For Ministers not to have listened to that point and to come in with set scripts renders this debate very barren.</P>
    <P>This housing crisis and the pressures on people who cannot afford housing are what will really unhinge the partnership process. People who are getting up at six o'clock in the morning to go to work do not have the prospect of owning their own home at the peak of their working lives and energy. People will not be satisfied with 4% extra in any partnership deal; they will want a radical increase in pay, which will have knock on effects in terms of national competitiveness, exports, jobs and investment.</P>
    <P>There has been a failure to deal with housing, the homeless and standards of accommodation for the elderly and this obviously requires new solutions. We will put forward a series of measures which will not only provide the resources but which will deal with issues of supply, put the appropriate structures in place and get rid of the bottleneck in planning, sanitary services and housing delivery, areas in which local voluntary organisations have succeeded but in which local authorities have not.</P>
    <P>I hope we have a slightly higher standard in this debate than set pieces from the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State responsible for housing. They simply came in here with speeches printed from the same word <Col N="1092" /> processors which spew out this speech at every tape cutting ceremony and function happening every Friday and Monday in constituencies. This debate deserves better than that. We support a detailed analysis of the possibility of enshrining these values and visions in the Constitution and that should be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this very timely motion. It is an indictment of our times that we have to seek to include such fundamental rights in our Constitution as we start out in the 21st century. As our people become richer, our society becomes poorer and our wealth and prosperity is bringing not a two tier society, but a multi-tier society as compassion and concern are the property of no one. Our economic masters instruct us on how the economy must be kept on track and the balance sheet is boss.</P>
      <P>In the middle of all this, a large group of people are looking in from the outside, with their noses pressed to the glass. There are almost 50,000 applicants on the housing waiting list. Perhaps it is time to say that a Government that presides over a housing waiting list of 50,000 applicants should not be in power. Tonight, as we speak, 340 young people under 20 years of age are homeless in the greater Dublin area. One of the contributing factors to this situation is the housing crisis and the lack of affordable accommodation. George Bernard Shaw said, &ldquo;Give me flowers when I can smell them&rdquo;. Many people in this country feel excluded and their dissatisfaction is bubbling underneath the surface.</P>
      <P>No doubt, the many Government speakers will list off the large amounts of funding that have been allocated here and there. We will be told we never had it so good. However, many commentators are missing the point. The average price of a new house for a first time buyer is £21,000 dearer now than this time last year. This, coupled with interest rate changes, has resulted in the repayments on a £100,000 mortgage increasing by £200 per month in the past year for a first time buyer. This money must be found somewhere and something has to give. Children see less of their parents and more of the television. Young children are left sleeping as the parent rushes to collect the baby minder. All meals are microwaved as life becomes a struggle.</P>
      <P>Some people will say the situation is not all that gloomy. However, I regret it is for many. We need only look at the abuse by our young people of alcohol and other substances, their disdain for authority and the street violence which is a weekly occurrence in every town. This is reflective of the breakdown of families, as parents feel required to put all their energies into sustaining a so-called decent life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 just over 30,000 houses were built, 26,000 of which were private and 4,000 of which were public. Four years later, in 1999, after two and half years of the current Government's term of office, with an escalating demand and more <Col N="1093" /> funding available, over 46,000 houses were built, an increase of 16,000. However, only 3,500 of those were public housing, with the remaining 43,000 privately owned. That tells us only one thing &ndash; this Government has failed, at a time when it is difficult to fail, to provide for the housing needs at the lower end of the market. The Government will seek to blame the local authorities. However, it is the Government's responsibility, a responsibility it has failed to live up to. The Government will seek to gloss over this neglect with Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>I try to be constructive when I speak on Private Members' motions. However, I can see no white teeth in this issue. No spin can change the fact that the holiday home has attained preference over the homeless. That has happened because of the Government's policies. It can be reversed if the will is there, but there is no evidence the will is there. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, spoke about concrete action. The Government has an aversion to concrete &ndash; its only relationship with concrete is in its mindset. A Government that presides over a housing waiting list of 50,000 applicants should not be in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which was presented by the Labour Party and which I welcome. It is a sad fact of modern life that people on the edge of society, those who demand most from the provision of social services, have to come cap in hand, begging to the courts, to have their rights vindicated. However, that is the real situation we face at the moment.</P>
      <P>I know the reality from cases in my constituency. There has been a vast number of celebrated cases in recent weeks, which have shown the only justice people can obtain is not through the political system or the actions of politicians or Departments, but through the courts system. As long as that is the case, we are abdicating our rights and responsibilities as politicians, as my colleague, Deputy Yates, said.</P>
      <P>There is a need to enshrine in our Constitution a new vision and set of standards of how we, as a society, will deal with people who are on the edge and are the most vulnerable in our modern society. We have looked after such people shamefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was highlighted this week by CORI, when it pointed out, once again, that Ireland is 17th on a list of 18 industrialised countries in terms of a poverty index. Our GDP expenditure levels on social provision and social protection are lagging far behind many other European Union countries. We spend about 17.5% of our annual GDP on the provision of social services for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. However, the average EU spend is about 28% and in Britain it is 26%. The notion that we are spending huge sums of our national resources on social provision to look after some of the most vulnerable in our society, which was alluded to by the three Ministers who spoke on the Bill tonight, is <Col N="1094" /> nonsensical, given that we spend only 17.5% of annual GDP on social programmes to help poorer people and those on the edge in our society. That lie must be nailed at the start of this debate.</P>
    <P>We have looked after people shamefully, which is a disgrace. We will show the redundancy of politics as long as people have to go before the courts to have their rights vindicated. That is why there is a need, in the context of this Bill, to put a new vision in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates is right that that new vision must be enshrined for children, in particular. I brought a case in my constituency to the attention of the House three weeks ago where a child, who was off the rails, was before the courts system on 12 separate occasions over a two year period. On every occasion he was sent to Oberstown House. However, there was no place for him there, so he was sent back home to stay with his parents and, surprise, surprise, within a number of days he was causing havoc in the community again. If it were not for a final intervention by the District Court, that child would still be running amok around parts of my constituency.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that, despite the involvement of social workers, education providers and the local authority system, it took so long for a decision to be ultimately made by the courts to send that child to Oberstown House, where a place was eventually found for him. That highlights the fact that there are few facilities in this country for children who have gone off the edge and are in danger. We have not developed any kind of modern system to help children in that situation.</P>
    <P>The same applies, as my colleagues said, to housing. The Minister delivered the same script to the House this evening that he has been delivering for the past 18 months. It is a script of platitudes, describing the actions the Government has been taking in recent years and months. However, the percentage of money we spend on social housing has reduced over the past five years. We all accept that total capital expenditure has grown substantially over recent years. However, about 8.5% is spent on social housing at the moment, which is lower than the percentage spent when the current Opposition was in Government before 1997 and also lower than that spent in the mid-1980s, which were incredibly difficult economic times. We are building fewer social houses, as a percentage of the total number of houses built in this country, than was the case ten or 15 years ago, and at a time when there is massive demand for social and affordable housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter which is particularly relevant to my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days there have been disturbing <Col N="1095" /> newspaper reports concerning the financial well-being of the Xerox Corporation. It has a significant Irish operation located in Blanchardstown and Dundalk. My concern is the Dundalk plant. When the IDA announced that Xerox was coming to Dundalk, it was a welcome shot in the arm for the town. For many years previously, the area had been blighted by unemployment. It was difficult to get industrial developments to locate there and when Xerox did so it was most welcome.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I read a press release issued by the company. It is clear there are restructuring plans afoot and one must ask what their implications will be for Dundalk. Given the huge State and company investment in the town, if there are implications they would be most serious. Employees, business and commercial interests are dependent on Xerox and they are anxious to be reassured about their position. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, can assure my constituents, particularly the people employed at Xerox, that all is well with the company and that we can look forward to the future with considerable hope and promise.</P>
    <P>We are advised that the technology for the product manufactured in Dundalk is more modern than that in the corporation's other plants worldwide. That appears to give Dundalk a considerable head start and I hope that is the case. If not, there would be serious implications. Industrial investment is hard won. It is a competitive market and getting industries to locate anywhere in Ireland is always a challenge. It is appropriate, therefore, to compliment the IDA on its success over recent years in attracting significant industries to Ireland. We are most appreciative of the investment that has come to the north east, particularly to County Louth.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, in advising the House of the situation, will be able to offer reassurances to the people of Dundalk and County Louth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share his concern at the recent poor financial performance of Xerox Corporation's worldwide activities.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling that the Xerox Corporation is the world's sixth largest information technology company and employs over 91,000 people in 130 countries. It is a public company on the New York Stock Exchange and last year it had sales of IR£17.97 billion and profits of IR£1.33 billion. Xerox Europe, the European operations of the Xerox Corporation, markets Xerox products, solutions and services throughout Europe and employs 19,000 people. It has manufacturing operations in Ireland, the UK and Holland, and advanced research and development centres in Cambridge in the UK and Grenoble in France, two well known university cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, the company carried out a review of <Col N="1096" /> its worldwide operations and decided to concentrate on the growth of digital based products, such as colour copiers and printers. It also adopted an improved business model for Europe, which included the provision of a number of business activities in Ireland. The new Irish operation is the single largest greenfield undertaking by Xerox and has been the fastest and most successful business ramp-up in the company's history. When fully implemented by the end of 2003, total employment levels are targeted to be 2,131 people in Dundalk and 1,995 people in Dublin, with a total investment in excess of IR£400 million. The current employment levels are ahead of target and now stand at 837 people in Dundalk and 1,515 people in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The 110 acre Xerox Technology Park at Dundalk is one of Xerox's three manufacturing facilities in Europe. Its 500,000 square foot facility will encompass the manufacture of colour toner, ink jet printer cartridges, ink jet printer heads, power supplies and electronic assemblies. The facility will also undertake software development. The manufacture of the advanced Docutech and Docuprint document solutions has already begun following the completion of the first of the technology park's five facilities, its 162,500 square foot hardware building, almost a year ago.</P>
    <P>Related activities at the technology park will include materials procurement, production management and associated accounting functions and group resources, such as quality management, human resources, environmental, health and safety functions. Xerox has already developed strong links both with the Dundalk Institute of Technology and the chamber of commerce. The investment at Dublin's Ballycoolin Business Park in Blanchardstown incorporates Xerox's multilingual shared financial services, technical support and customer support operations for the entire European market. It also includes the establishment of a centralised server farm to support the company's pan-European information technology functions. The Dublin campus will incorporate six buildings covering over 270,000 square feet of premises. Ireland will be the primary European location for centralised shared services, technical support, colour toner production, inkjet printer cartridges and high end product manufacturing.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the company's worldwide financial performance has been disappointing recently. Last year its sales were down slightly on the 1998 figure. For the first six months of the current financial year sales were down on the equivalent period in 1999 and a net loss of £92 million was incurred. The developments have been reflected in the share price, which has fallen considerably. The company today announced its financial returns for the third quarter of this year. A loss of $167 million was incurred on sales, which are 4% lower than the comparable period of 1999.</P>
    <P>The poor results are attributed to a number of factors including currency fluctuations, an unfavourable product mix in terms of margins, continuing teething difficulties with the reorgan<Col N="1097" /> isation of the company especially in the realign ment of the sales force which has led to reduced productivity and pressure on prices due to strong global competition. The company has, therefore, announced several measures to address these difficulties. These include cutting $1 billion in costs, including significant redundancies. A major disposal of assets to raise between $2 billion and $4 billion is proposed. The company also intends to cease its equipment finance operations.</P>
    <P>Despite these major problems, the company has reported growth in its colour products and inkjet printers which are important elements of the Irish operation. While the full details of the cost cutting measures have not yet been clarified, the expectation is that there will be no adverse implications for the Irish operation in either the short or medium term. There are no plans to restructure the Irish activities. It will be some time before all aspects of the changes in the worldwide activities of this excellent company are resolved, particularly in relation to which elements will be outsourced or sold, but the IDA is keeping in close contact with the company. The position will become clearer in due course and we are hopeful that the Irish elements will thrive and prosper in the years immediately ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to debate the proposal to sell Whitegate oil refinery.</P>
      <P>On 18 March 1982, Deputy Albert Reynolds, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that petroleum products are almost as essential to the economy as food is to the individual. He went on to say that it behoved the Government to guard against the risk that supplies of these products could be interrupted for reasons outside its control. We recently witnessed an oil blockade crisis in Britain and other European countries. Even though the Minister told me that did not pose an interruption to the distribution of the normal refined product here, I am informed by other sources that had the disruption gone on a little longer, we would have experienced shortages. Last winter when there was no blockade, 5,800 tonnes of kerosene were released to the oil companies from the strategic reserves because there was a shortage of heating oil in the Munster area.</P>
      <P>The issue of oil refining is of vital national interest. We are currently witnessing a serious situation in the Middle East, which could lead to a shortage of oil on world markets. We must be very careful how we approach this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State oil refinery at Whitegate is to be sold to Tosco, which has a chequered history in terms of safety concerns and environmental incidents, to which recent newspaper reports alluded. While Tosco is a large company and those were probably isolated incidents, I ask the Minister to be very careful in this regard, as this is a matter of vital national interest. Will Tosco guarantee that <Col N="1098" /> it will be able to supply the Irish market with refined product? Is there any provision to prevent it from exporting refined product from Whitegate and leaving us in the lurch, if it gets a better price elsewhere? If there was a shortage of refined product in Europe, we would depend on Whitegate to supply us with refined product. I am informed there is a major problem internationally not with crude oil but with refined product. Refineries in America and Europe are literally working flat out.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the price the consumer is charged for the product does not escalate. I hope this deal will ensure that the price of the product will decrease rather than increase. Can the Minister of State guarantee that the existing jobs at Whitegate and Whiddy will be secure? Can he indicate when this deal will go through? I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business recently if legislation is required in this area, to which he replied it is not. Yet the INPC Limited Bill is listed on the Government legislative programme. When will that be introduced, given that it has not yet been published? This deal is about to go through. What is happening in that context?</P>
    <P>As an island nation we cannot bring petrol or refined product into the country any other way but by sea. Whitegate supplies more than one third of our oil needs. If this deal goes wrong, we will be in serious trouble economically. Deputy Albert Reynolds recognised that way back in 1982. I ask the Government to be careful and sure of its ground in terms of what it is doing here.</P>
    <P>The Tosco Corporation is carrying out a due diligence survey of Whitegate. Has the Government carried out a due diligence survey of Tosco? Tosco will be required to operate the plant for 15 years, which is a relatively short time. What will happen after that period? Will Tosco then be able to sell the plant or close it down? Will it be able to close it down in the meantime and, if so, will the Government be able to take action to prevent it? There are many questions about this proposed sale.</P>
    <P>I understand Whiddy Island oil terminal is also for sale, although it is proposed that the Government will lease it back. I am informed the sale price is $100 million. If the State has to come up with moneys to pay the loan, will we be giving it away for almost nothing to a foreign company? What will the State, the consumer and the workers gain for that proposed sale? Last year INPC made a profit. Much credit is due to the workers and management of the INPC for turning that company around and making it the success it is today.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply. This is a serious issue of vital national interest to consumers and to the workers concerned and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Deputy on raising this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Imminent&rdquo; is not a word the Minister for Pub<Col N="1099" /> lic Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would use regarding this proposal at this stage. After a fairly lengthy process to identify openings to develop business opportunities to underpin the operation of the INPC facilities at Whitegate and Bantry, heads of agreement were signed between the INPC and Tosco Corporation of the United States.</P>
    <P>We are now at a stage where Tosco is in the process of a due diligence review of the two operations and INPC is also reviewing Tosco. If successful, this could lead to detailed negotiations for a sale of the assets or the subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The initiative to solicit outside interest in the facilities was requested by the Minister in the context of the major investment requirements at the refinery in support of the Auto Oil specifications agreed in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied after taking independent consultancy advice that the original selection process was a robust one and that the Tosco proposal recommended by the INPC board was the best on offer. If it comes to fruition, it will result in guaranteed operation of the facilities for 15 years with security of employment and conditions for the workforce. The workforce at the facilities has a great record in terms of diligence, safety, dependability etc.</P>
    <P>There is a gross consideration of $100 million on offer but when account is taken of the existing debts the net proceeds will be considerably less. In addition, the refinery should be able to operate without the support of the mandatory regime, which has been an artificial support to the economics of the refinery for many years. Tosco also indicates that it will make commercial investments in the development of the facilities and in addition set up its European headquarters in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The National Oil Reserves Agency is not part of the deal and will remain under the umbrella of the State. This will facilitate a sharper focus on the supply security provided by strategic stocks.</P>
    <P>If all this comes to pass it will give the refinery and the Bantry terminal a more integrated role in a wider business and capture the benefits of bigger scale in terms of personnel and career development. It will remove the uncertainty which inevitably arises when further major investment is required in State ownership &ndash; this would certainly arise when Auto Oil II comes along for 2005.</P>
    <P>Most of the detailed contacts at present are between the INPC and Tosco, but the Deputy can rest assured that my Department and the Department of Finance are actively monitoring the situation and representing the shareholder interest. We have engaged Arthur Andersen and Matheson Ormsby and Prentice to assist us with this.</P>
    <P>Whatever emerges from the discussions will require the approval of the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance. They will be watching with interest to ensure that a bal<Col N="1100" /> anced and equitable deal emerges to which they can comfortably give their consent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue of importance to the region I represent.</P>
      <P>If proof was needed that the Government's policy on the north-west is to turn it into a nature reserve with large tracts of forests, mountains and lakes and the odd human inhabitant living in a hut, the announcement by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, yesterday evening outlining the proposed extension of the natural gas pipeline from the Corrib field gas find off the Mayo coast that will service towns such as Tuam, Athenry, Galway city, Castlebar and Claremorris, with no proposal for a pipeline to service any area of the north-west, confirms the Government's total abdication of its commitment to the region. That decision and others taken recently show a total lack of commitment to the development of Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.</P>
      <P>The road infrastructure to the region has failed to receive funding under the national development plan. The N4 will have dual carriageway status from Dublin to Mullingar and only single carriageway status, as currently exists, from Mullingar to Sligo. The proposed new signalling system for the Sligo-Dublin rail link has been postponed indefinitely due to a debacle of the highest incompetence shown by a semi-State body and the Minister presiding over it.</P>
      <P>How can a region develop if the Government is not prepared to give a lead and provide the necessary funding for infrastructural development? How can the most isolated region in the country hope to develop when the Government discriminates against it? The Government has taken the region for granted and shown scant regard for the many families who are trying to eke out a living in the area. I have no doubt that the political arrogance manifests itself by reason of the fact that of the ten Deputies who represent the region, only three oppose the Government.</P>
      <P>The statement by the Minister, Deputy Fahey, yesterday confirmed that he would pursue the building of a further pipeline from Pollatomish <i>via</i> Ballina to Sligo, depending on whether Bord Gáis can provide the funding. I challenge the Minister's statement. BGE may have the administrative responsibility for the pipeline but it will be necessary for the Government to provide the financing for the project. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources should abandon his aspirational claptrap and convince his Government colleagues to provide the necessary funding to take the national gas pipeline to Sligo and the north-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituents do not want pious promises. They want the funding for the gas pipeline, the upgrading of the N4 from single carriageway to dual carriageway or motorway status from Sligo <Col N="1101" /> to Mullingar and the immediate improvement of the signalling system on the Sligo-Dublin rail track. This investment in the north-west is necessary if the people there are to see jobs brought to the three counties and to experience the necessary increase in population that will allow us to grow economically and socially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The extension of the natural gas network to various areas of the country and to individual towns is a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann in the first instance. All proposals for natural gas pipelines, whether they are to be built by BGE or private pipeline developers, must be submitted to me for approval under the Gas Acts. In approving those proposals I can attach certain conditions in relation to safety and environmental considerations, but I cannot determine what the route of the pipeline will be or what towns along its route are to be served by spur lines. This is a matter for the pipeline developers and will be made by them on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>Given recent announcements in the media, I understand the Deputy's concerns and am happy to explain the current state of developments regarding BGE's plans for extending the natural gas network. The main development in the extension of the gas transmission network is the proposal by BGE to build a new pipeline from Dublin to Galway and onwards to Limerick. As gas demand increases and as the Kinsale field comes to the end of its natural life over the next couple of years, there is a necessity to reinforce the gas transmission system to ensure that it is capable of meeting demand in the south of the country. The option of providing this extra capacity by building a pipeline to the west and on to the south has the added benefit of making gas available to areas in the midlands and the west as yet unserved by a gas supply. BGE is advanced in its plans for this pipeline and detailed engineering and the preparation of a full application for consent are well under way.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies will be aware that the Taoiseach recently announced a joint venture between BGE and the consortium involved in the exploration of the Corrib field to build a pipeline from Pollatomish in Mayo to Craughwell in Galway to bring gas from the Corrib field to the main BGE onshore system in anticipation of a final decision on the commerciality of the field by the Corrib partners. In relation to this proposed pipeline, the House will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, announced yesterday that BGE has indicated that Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry will be among the towns along the route of the pipeline from Pollatomish to Galway that will receive a natural gas supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BGE is committed to connecting the natural gas network to all major towns in the country provided that this can be done in line with their commercial mandate under the Gas Acts. BGE has informed me that in addition to providing a <Col N="1102" /> gas supply to the towns mentioned earlier, the prospect of supplying gas to other centres of population in the north-west is under active review as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>The question of gas supply to other towns in the catchment area of the proposed pipelines, or those in more distant counties, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, is a matter for BGE to examine in assessing the economics of extending the transmission and distribution networks into the north-west. When this assessment has been completed a fuller picture as to the viability of such extensions will emerge.</P>
    <P>My outlook is to be as helpful and as positive as possible, but I cannot anticipate the analysis by BGE. I also have regard to economic realities and it seems to me that if a particular town cannot be served on a commercially viable basis, then serving it would trigger a need for external subvention. This in turn raises ownership issues and potential State aid issues which would have to be dealt with at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this issue.</P>
      <P>It is now nearly a fortnight since the High Court issued its judgment in relation to the Government's half-hearted and half baked plans for additional taxi plates. After three years in power the Government's uninspiring proposals lie in tatters. Policy is as confused and unclear as it was the day the Government took office and we are no nearer to providing the travelling public with the taxi service it needs and deserves.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to clearly outline his views on the High Court judgment and to inform the House of the immediate steps he intends to take to solve the chronic taxi crisis. There has been a taxi crisis in Dublin for a number of years and in advance of the last general election the issue was being dealt with by the local authorities and the Dublin Transportation Office. Progress was slow but taxi licences were issued for the first time in years. However, that process was stopped in its tracks by the incoming Government and the Taoiseach in particular.</P>
      <P>During the 1997 election campaign the strong links between key people in the taxi business and the Fianna Fáil Party in Dublin became abundantly clear. A number of Fianna Fáil candidates across the city had their name and the Fianna Fáil logo emblazoned on taxi cabs and the Taoiseach himself posed on the steps of Áras de Valera with taxi drivers proclaiming the merits of zero tolerance. In short, a section of the taxi industry was mobilised as the mechanised division of Fianna Fáil during that campaign. Is it any surprise that the Taoiseach directly involved himself in this issue after the election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach's taxi forum proved to be little more than a talking shop. The abject fail<Col N="1103" /> ure of this body to make progress forced the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to issue his own proposals. Those proposals were a peculiar variation of the much vaunted Progressive Democrat belief in deregulation and competition, but probably the only proposals which Fianna Fáil would allow to emerge.</P>
    <P>Those proposals have been dealt a terminal blow. The reality now is that after three years there is no Government policy in relation to taxis. The situation is more confused than ever and the Minister of State and the Government appear utterly without direction while confusion and lethargy are the order of the day. Meanwhile, the people of Dublin are expected to endure an appalling situation. The scarcity of taxis is intolerable. People are forced to queue for hours on end after a night out in an attempt to get home. Many people have to resort to walking home at all hours due to the lack of taxis while lengthy queues are regular features at the airport and the train stations. This simply cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The first issue the Minister must deal with is the question of a Supreme Court appeal on foot of the High Court decision. A lengthy appeal process in the Supreme Court will tie up the whole issue and leave the travelling public without the taxis that are needed. While an appeal might provide the Government with a legal fig leaf for inaction, it is the responsibility of the Minister of State to avoid this. The Government should accept that its convoluted plan has been effectively blown out of the water and the proposals are off the table. Action, not lengthy litigation, is urgently needed. This action cannot be left to the courts to decide. It is the obligation of Government to devise and implement public policy, not the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State must put the needs of the travelling public first. The overwhelming demand for taxis cannot be denied any longer and that is the bottom line. In introducing more taxis the Minister of State must also recognise the investment that taxi drivers who own a single licence have made over recent years. Their investment and their livelihood cannot be wiped out overnight. However, the High Court judgment is quite clear that the Minister of State's current plan is impractical and flies in the face of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. The Minister of State should outline the action he now intends to take to at long last solve the taxi crisis which has deepened significantly in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>High Court judicial review proceedings relating to the overall proposed scheme to <Col N="1104" /> increase Dublin taxi licence numbers and a range of provisions contained in the public service vehicles regulations were initiated on 7 February and a judgment was given on Friday, 13 October. However, the final determination of the judicial review, including the relevant orders of the High Court, will not be finalised until the judge has heard further from the various counsel on Tuesday next, 31 October.</P>
      <P>The full implications of the decision will only become clear following the above process and detailed examination and analysis of the matter which is being urgently undertaken in my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and State counsel.</P>
      <P>The judgment raises a number of complex issues, some of which may have repercussions for the legislative and regulatory code for taxis generally. It is clear that it puts in question the legislative basis for existing quantitative controls on taxi licences and the validity of the scheme to increase taxi numbers put in place by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000. The decision may also have implications for the delegation of certain functions to local authorities, including the determination of the number of taxi licences to be granted and the determination of taxi licence fee levels. It may also require consideration of how wheelchair accessibility is to be maintained for the taxi fleet.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government remains strongly committed to improving Dublin and other taxi services for the benefit of all concerned. Every effort will be made to provide for an increase in Dublin taxi licence numbers as quickly as possible with due regard to the court findings.</P>
      <P>Greater increases in Dublin taxi licence numbers have already taken place within the term of this Government than under any other Government for more than 20 years. Since we entered office, taxi numbers in Dublin have risen by 750 and we announced last November that we were taking the radical step of issuing 3,100 additional taxi plates, more than doubling the existing fleet. No new taxi licences were issued in Dublin during the term of office of the previous Administration, of which Deputy Gilmore was part.</P>
      <P>This Government has adopted progressive policy initiatives for improving Dublin taxi services. These have been complicated by the present judicial review but the direction and resolve of our reforms is not altered. I remain strongly convinced that public demand for taxis must be satisfied and I intend to work to ensure that this is done as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 October 2000.</P>

Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue.</P>
      <P>However, I can inform the Deputy that I have decided that the time is now ripe to proceed with the establishment of a legislative Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. In establishing this office we must ensure that we provide a credible grievance system which is fair to all members of the forces while at the same time safeguarding the operational flexibility of the Defence Forces. Discussions will now take place with the representative associations in order to define the powers and scope of a military Ombudsman that will meet the needs of the various parties. I would also like to point out to the Deputy that pursuant to the provisions of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, military personnel may make complaints against my Department to the Ombudsman appointed under that Act.</P>
      <P>The discussion process is also likely to result in an updating of the existing internal complaints procedures. As soon as those discussions are completed I will make the necessary legislative arrangements to give effect to the Ombudsman proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 147 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 3 October 2000 the roles of the Defence Force as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence which was published in February this year. To aid the civil power &ndash; meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána who have the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State &ndash; is among the assigned roles.</P>
      <P>As can be seen, the primary responsibility for internal security rests with An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the gardaí as required. This entails such duties as assisting the gardaí at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches, including in the Border area. The Defence Forces also assist the gardaí in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts. No change in this role is envisaged. The question of the level of demand on the Defence Forces in aid of the Garda is kept under constant review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Government Departments as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash in 1999, the latest full year for which figures are available, was £4.5 million approximately. In line with the Government decision imposing a charge on the banks, part of these costs are recouped. In 1999, £2.25 million was refunded by the banks to my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>In the first instance I should say that apart from the dangers which would arise from unexploded ordnance in the area of the proposed scheme both in the construction phase and in relation to subsequent maintenance of any facilities erected, the proposed West Wicklow water scheme has very major implications for Defence Forces training.</P>
      <P>The Glen of Imaal is the single most important training area for the Defence Forces. Any diminution in the size of the existing facility would have the most serious consequences for the continued safe conduct of training in a range of weapons used by the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that minimum standards are essential to ensure that personnel are adequately trained to use such weapons not only at home but also on overseas missions. Any shortfall in this respect would clearly expose the State to approbation and, perhaps, significant expense. There is no alternative facility available elsewhere of adequate size and configuration which would allow the Defence Forces to carry out this essential training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 119 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based upon the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group produced its report in September 1999. The various recommendations contained in its report have been accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future. I am satisfied that a very thorough, comprehensive and <Col N="1108" /> indepth study of the reserve has now been undertaken involving a very considerable amount of work undertaken both by the original military board, which was established by the then chief of staff, and latterly by the steering group itself.</P>
    <P>Throughout the course of their respective deliberations, there was a close ongoing constructive relationship between the military board and the steering group, who kept each other closely briefed on progress and developments.</P>
    <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and those associations made presentations to the group regarding their own specific areas of concern. The steering group also met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, which also made presentations to the group.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is that it has a countrywide geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force as envisaged by the steering group will have to be determined in the course of the actual detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report. The actual implementation of the structural and reorganisation changes, on the ground, will require a period of about six years to bring to completion. This detailed process will require the military authorities to consider and to bring forward recommendations and detailed proposals for the restructuring of local reserve units within each of the Army Brigade areas. The military authorities are preparing these proposals at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am anxious, given the dependence of the reserves on voluntary service, that there should be a further process of consultation before these proposals are finalised. The military authorities are now developing a proposal in this regard. I envisage linking publication of the steering group report to the launch of this process.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper, one important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that in future members of the reserve should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions, subject of course to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by comparable reservists on overseas peace support missions by other countries is quite common. However, the general criteria governing selection for overseas service are issues within the scope of representation. Therefore, any matters relating to proposals for future overseas service by members of the reserve, which come within the scope of representation, will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. In addition, the question of the security of civilian employment, for those members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas, will have <Col N="1109" /> to be considered as part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level in Brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces training centre, the steering group recommended the creation of four new Lieutenant-Colonel appointments within the reserve. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established it will form another part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve which will consist of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training and career development opportunities and will be provided with appropriate equipment. The other element will provide the overall Army reserve, will be organised into three Brigades and the personnel will be trained on standard military lines.</P>
    <P>An Slua Muirí will be developed to improve the capacity of members to provide a genuine Naval reserve capability based on a revised overall strength of up to 400 personnel. As a rationalisation measure the two Dublin based companies of An Slua Muirí will be amalgamated. The Naval Service, in conjunction with the Director of Reserve Forces, will formulate specific proposals to develop an integration role for the reorganised An Slua Muirí.</P>
    <P>Finally, one should really emphasise that the steering group were particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

    <P>The White Paper on Defence set out an agreed total for the PDF of 10,500, with a provision for an additional 250 young recruits in training. The recent Pricewaterhouse Coopers special studies on the Naval Service and Air Corps set out recommended overall strengths of 1,144 for the Naval Service and 930 for the Air Corps respectively. These will be met from within the overall Permanent Defence Force figure.</P>
    <P>The actual restructuring of the PDF to secure conformity with the White Paper envelope strength of 10,500 and also with the recommendations of the management consultants on both the Naval Service and the Air Corps will be achieved by way of very detailed implementation plans for each of the services.</P>
    <P>In the past few years, I have been operating a policy of continuous or &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; general service recruitment for all branches of the Permanent Defence Force. The annual cadetship competition also continues to draw an excellent field of very talented young people who wish to become commissioned officers.</P>
    <P>In so far as the participation of the Permanent Defence Force in international activities is concerned, it should be emphasised that all current and pending international commitments of human resource significance were fully factored into the thorough exercise of review and analysis involved in the development of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The PDF contribution to the range of international operations and taskings is now actually at an all time high. At present Ireland subscribes to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, under which the State offers to provide up to 850 personnel on overseas service at any given time. This is an expression of policy intent and not a binding commitment.</P>
    <P>In the past four years there has been a 25% increase in the numbers of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas. Defence Forces participation in recent UN mandated missions, SFOR &ndash; Bosnia and Herzegovina &ndash; KFOR &ndash; Kosovo &ndash; and UNTAET &ndash; East Timor &ndash; allied to ongoing missions such as UNIFIL, has seen the numbers serving overseas increase. At present <Col N="1111" /> there is a total of 951 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas. This is a substantial commitment for a country of our size.</P>
    <P>Participation in PfP is on an entirely voluntary and selective basis according to the particular preferences and priorities of each individual participating country within the partnership. No changes in the strength of the Defence Forces will be required or are envisaged as a result of Ireland's participation in PfP.</P>

      <P>A total of 31 personal injury claims primarily alleging post traumatic stress disorder have been taken against the Minister for Defence by serving or former members of the Defence Forces. In addition, a further ten claims alleging post traumatic stress disorder as an ancillary injury have also been received.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have for some time operated a stress management and PTSD programme, the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to enable the provision of support so that the consequences of traumatic and stressful situations can be dealt with in an appropriate and timely manner. This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the consultation process which is in place, the position is that both the representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, are in continuing contact with my Department on this issue under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. As is usual I do not wish, therefore, to comment further at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>The tables which I propose to circulate in the Official Report indicate the strength of male and female personnel within the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 June 2000, the most recent date for which such figures are currently available from the military authorities. These figures provide a breakdown between officers and various non-commissioned ranks across each of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. A total of 44 female personnel have been recruited to the Defence Forces during the current recruitment campaign.</P>
      <P>In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 136, 140 and 210 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Helsinki European Council in December, 1999, agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for the Petersberg tasks. This target, known as a head <Col N="1114" /> line goal, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year. This would roughly equate to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>What Helsinki agreed on was a voluntary capabilities target with the aim of ensuring effective capabilities for the Petersberg tasks. As the Helsinki European Council conclusions make clear, this does not imply the creation of a European army. Nor does it alter the fact that participation in the Petersberg tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council at the meeting of 20 March 2000, which I attended together with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, considered the way forward for elaborating the headline and capability goals set at Helsinki and also sought to develop a method of consultation through which the target could be met and progress reviewed.</P>
    <P>On 22 September 2000, I attended an informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers in Paris. This was the second such informal meeting this year, the first having taken place at Sintra, Portugal, on 28 February. The Paris meeting provided an opportunity to discuss informally, developments regarding European defence and security policy. It was not a decision making forum.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. At present, Ireland subscribes to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, under which the State offers to provide up to 850 personnel on overseas service at any given time.</P>
    <P>In the context of planning work which is currently under way at EU level, Ireland has submitted an initial and provisional indication that, in line with the national commitment to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), we are considering a contribution of up to 790 personnel to the EU headline goal. The majority of this commitment would be in the form of a light infantry battalion.</P>
    <P>A capabilities commitment conference is scheduled for 20 November 2000, at which EU member states will formally announce their contributions with a view to enabling the EU fulfil the Headline Goal. In conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I will be bringing proposals regarding Ireland's contribution to the headline goal to Government in advance of the capabilities commitment conference.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to international peace and security will be maintained within the current level of defence expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>By 20 September 2000 a total of 15,254 claims for alleged hearing loss had been lodged. Some 6,566 claims had been disposed of, leaving 8,688 still outstanding. A total of £125.22 million has been paid in damages, including plaintiffs legal costs of £36.18 million. The average settlement in these claims has been successfully reduced from over £30,000 per claim during the period 1994-96 to a current average of less than £7,500 per claim. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Hanley case, I estimated that the Army hearing loss claims might be resolved for a total cost of the order of £200 to £300 million. The progress made in my Department in seeking to establish the most suitable method of resolving the outstanding claims continues to support this estimate.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am now keen to ensure that the outstanding claims are disposed of using the speediest mechanism available to us. Deputies will be aware that the majority of personal injury claims are settled by negotiations between the parties to the litigation and very few claims proceed to court. In this way, legal costs are kept to a minimum. The judgment in the Hanley case has laid down a scale which can apply to the majority of outstanding hearing loss claims and there is no longer a requirement to proceed to the steps of the courts with these claims.</P>
      <P>After the Hanley judgment, with the support of the Law Society of Ireland, I moved to establish a series of direct negotiations between State officials and the leading solicitor's representing plaintiffs. Good progress was made with these negotiations which continued throughout the summer holiday period.</P>
      <P>To date, over 750 claims have been settled by way of a pilot settlement scheme established under the negotiations. The levels of compensation being paid in the claims which settled in this way is the same as that which was being paid in the courts in the period prior to the establishment of the scheme. Significantly, the scheme has also successfully reduced the levels of legal costs by an average of 50% per claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> The pilot scheme has established a mechanism which could efficiently dispose of the majority of outstanding claims without recourse to the courts. If there is a general willingness on the part of plaintiffs to settle claims under this scheme, the resources which my Department is currently dedicating to dealing with the claims in the courts could readily be deployed on a full time basis to the settlement scheme, and officials of my Department would be willing to enter settlement negotiations with solicitor firms as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware Ireland joined Partnership for Peace on 1 December 1999. The areas of interest to Ireland in Partnership for Peace are set out in the presentation document which was approved by Dáil Éireann on 9 November 1999 and which was presented to the NATO secretariat upon signature by Ireland of the PfP Framework Document on 1 December 1999. PfP is of importance in facilitating planning and co-operation for the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the NATO secretariat, an individual partnership programme is being developed for the year 2001, which will set out the level and extent of proposed participation in such areas as co-operation in peacekeeping principles, doctrine, training, exercises and inter-operability in peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in PfP in the year 2001 will focus on the enhancement of current skills and expertise in such areas as operational and generic planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures and logistics. This will take the form of participation at appropriate meetings, seminars and training courses.</P>
      <P>In line with the PfP principle of self-differentiation, Ireland retains the final say on the scope and content of the individual partnership programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland intends to participate in the PfP planning and review process, PARP, with a view to enhancing interoperability with our PfP partners in such areas as tactics, operational cohesion, logistics and language training. The aim is to create the conditions in which different contingents can work together efficiently and effectively. Ireland wishes to contribute its UN peacekeeping experience by playing an active part in humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks &ndash; the Petersberg Tasks &ndash; in support of the European Union's CFSP. Ireland <Col N="1117" /> sees PfP in general, and the PARP in particular, as having a significant role to role in co-operation and planning for participation in such tasks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the Doherty report, the then Government decided to reject the recommendation to purchase two Sea King type helicopters for operation by the Air Corps. The decision was taken in the prevailing circumstances where the Air Corps was not in a position to undertake these tasks due, <i>inter alia</i>, to a shortage of flying officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided to opt instead for the supply, on civil contract to the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, now the Irish Coast Guard, of one medium lift Sikorsky S61 type heli<Col N="1118" /> copter which is similar to a Sea King. This helicopter commenced operations in Shannon on 1 July 1991. This was followed up on 1 July 1998 with the provision, again on civil contract to the Irish Coast Guard, of another Sikorsky S61 helicopter which is based at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>The current Government fully recognise that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I was pleased to announce on 1 March 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with a option of a third, for Search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    <P>The tender competition is being carried out in two stages, a request for proposals stage and a request for tenders stage. Responses to the RFP were received in the Department on 21 September 2000. Six responses were received. Those responses are now being evaluated in the Department with a view to drawing up a short list of contenders for the RFT stage.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the RFT stage will commence early in the new year following which a clearer picture will emerge on possible delivery dates etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of enlisting non-nationals in the Defence Forces is not a new one. At present, the military authorities have the authority to approve applicants for enlistment who are not Irish nationals. Each application is taken on its merits and examined on an individual basis before a decision is made. I understand that about ten such people are currently serving in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the recent annual delegate conference of PDFORRA the question of targeting recruitment of non-nationals was discussed. The general secretary of PDFORRA addressing the conference called on the Ministers for Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to initiate immediate discussions with all interested parties, with a view to inviting and attracting non-nationals to join the Defence Forces in return for an accelerated entitlement to citizenship. The general secretary when speaking on the motion also indicated that he wished the issues raised to be considered with <Col N="1119" /> a view to presenting details of any scheme to next years conference for approval.</P>
    <P>In looking at this issue it goes without saying that Irish society has to become far more open and inclusive. There are many existing rules, attitudes and assumptions which will have to be challenged as part of this process. In that context it is opportune that we review the criteria for enlistment in the Defence Force. I will approach the review with a completely open mind concerned only to ensure that whatever rules need to be applied will reflect the realities of the 21st century. However, I would caution that the existing rigorous selection procedure and security clearance requirements will always be applied.</P>
    <P>The question of entitlement to citizenship is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Officials from my Department will work with the military authorities and with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other interested parties to review the current criteria in relation to enlistment.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Air Corps that the incident which took place on the recent rescue mission off the Donegal coast was not a failure of the radar equipment <i>per se</i>; rather it was a disconnection which occurred in a box between the radar itself and the display in the cockpit. This was identified when the preliminary investigation took place upon completion of mission, and was verified by the engineering investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disconnection was ascribed to the severe buffeting which the aircraft received from low level turbulence in the course of the rescue. The Air Corps consider that this was a relatively minor incident as the helicopter is equipped with adequate primary navigational equipment. In this regard, it should be noted that the mission was successfully completed with the pilot using the <Col N="1120" /> normal navigation equipment to fly the casualty to Carrickfin Airport without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>While any system may fail, failure prevention is based on the maintenance procedures which are appropriate and certified for each aircraft, aircraft system and ancillary equipment. The Air Corps have advised that the investigation did not perceive any requirement to amend the maintenance procedure in this instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 130 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any plans or proposals to establish a second airport at Gormanstown, County Meath. I have also no information regarding the status of lands adjacent to the aerodrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gormanstown Aerodrome is currently used as an army and military aviation installation. Whilst there has been a downgrading of its status for military flying purposes, in line with the recommendations of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers review of the Air Corps, there will be a continuing requirement to retain its status as a military aerodrome. The retention of this facility for Army purposes will remain and may increase. Proposals to establish a Flying Training Organisation at Gormanstown were considered by a steering group representing the Department of Pub<Col N="1121" /> lic Enterprise, Department of Defence and the Irish Aviation Authority. A draft report was submitted in late July 2000 and is currently being examined by the Minister for Public Enterprise, myself and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>The steering group in the course of their deliberations did invite proposals from commercial interests for the establishment of an approved flight training organisation at the aerodrome. Four proposals were initially received of which two were subsequently withdrawn.</P>
    <P>To establish any civil aviation operation at Gormanstown Aerodrome it will be necessary to amend section 3 of the Irish Aviation Act 1993 to enable that authority to regulate the safety aspects of any civilian aviation operation. This amendment is currently being considered by this House.</P>

      <P>On Sunday 15 October 2000, while commencing towing operations in the hanger at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, the cab of an aircraft towing tractor came into contact with the port mainplane of the Gulfstream IV, causing damage to it. As a result the aircraft was grounded.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection by a Gulfstream representative from the United Kingdom, it was decided that the leading edge would have to be replaced and as there was none in stock, a replacement was manufactured by Gulfstream in Savannah. This part is currently being replaced under the supervision of a specialist from Gulfstream and it is expected that this process will be completed by Thursday p.m., 26 October.</P>

      <P>Drug misuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been comparatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that, as a component of the wider community, they mirror that community to a <Col N="1122" /> large degree in that its members are drawn from all sectors of our society.</P>
      <P>Any question of drug abuse among members of the Defence Forces would present a serious and potentially dangerous problem, particularly as members of the Defence Forces may be required to carry firearms, as part of their normal duties. In addition, drug abuse is prejudicial to good order and discipline and therefore at variance with the ethos of the Defence Forces. It is considered desirable that a programme to deal with this issue be drawn up.</P>
      <P>The proposal to introduce a compulsory substance testing programme in the Defence Forces as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme is at present the subject of discussions in my Department and will be discussed at the conciliation council for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, which were agreed with the representative associations, provide that matters being discussed under it are confidential to the parties involved. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any detail on this matter other than to say that every effort is being made to effect a mutually satisfactory resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>My overall objective as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces that it <Col N="1123" /> needs and that the Defence Forces continue to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve. That is the overall objective of the White Paper and I can assure the House that implementation is moving ahead quickly and positively.</P>
      <P>The chief of staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. That plan will help us to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>My intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by end-2001, in accordance with the Government decision.</P>
      <P>It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces Personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The chief of staff is currently drafting a plan to this end. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Force. A campaign to recruit an additional 750 personnel began in April and I relaunched this last month.</P>
      <P>I have made my position clear that the representative associations are to be consulted fully in a spirit of partnership before the plans are finalised.</P>
      <P>Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by Price Waterhouse Consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me. I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will now be put in place while other elements of the plan are being developed.</P>
      <P>As in the case of the Air Corps, the Naval Service prepared a detailed implementation plan which I have approved. Implementation is proceeding, including the putting in place of the new organisation provided for in the plan. The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported to me last year. I believe that the recommendations contained in the report give us a general basis on which to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans are being drawn up for the launch of a consultative process to seek the views of <Col N="1124" /> members of the reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan. It is estimated that the implementation of any necessary structural and organisational change will take a period of about six years.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased earlier this year to announce an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. This will be funded from payroll savings and from the sales of property surplus to requirements and will include: about £55 million over three years on the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps with special priority being given to the procurement of new medium range helicopters for the Air Corps; more than £20 million for a second new state of the art fishery patrol vessel for the Naval Service, similar to <i>LE Róisín</i> which was commissioned in 1999; and about £25 million over three years for investment in light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment.</P>
    <P>All the foregoing are additional to: £40 million for a new fleet of armoured personnel carriers for the Army &ndash; the first of these will be handed-over in early 2001; some £22 million for a state of the art offshore patrol vessel, the <i>LE Róisín</i>, which was delivered in 1999; more than £10.5 million for new tactical VHF radios; more than £6.5 million on specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4s, and ¾ ton trucks.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, more than £100 million &ndash; this includes £50 million from the proceeds of the sale of property &ndash; is being committed to the development of buildings and other infrastructure at military installations.</P>

In the five year capital works programme, 2001-2005, provision is being made to upgrade billet accommodation at an estimated cost of £500,000.</P>

      <P>The tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report indicates the number of appointments for non-commissioned officers that were vacant as of 30 September 2000, the most recent date for which such figures are currently available from the military authorities. These figures provide a breakdown of the vacancies by rank for non-commissioned officers across each of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. The figures for the Air Corps and Naval Service are based on the proposed new organisational structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from 1 November 1998, a chief of staff's administrative instruction, implementing a new organisation for the Defence Forces became <Col N="1126" /> effective under the then Defence Forces review implementation plan. This resulted in a number of NCO's and Privates being technically designated as serving without appointment. For various reasons, SWA personnel could not be mandatorily posted or transferred to other geographical locations. This situation resulted in a surplus of NCO's in some locations and deficiencies in others.</P>
    <P>However, on 1 September 1999, the deputy chief of staff &ndash;  Support &ndash; directed that all substantive NCO vacancies &ndash; above the rank of Corporal &ndash; which arise due to the discharge of that specific appointment holder, be filled. The purpose of this direction was to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in regard to the current NCO strength versus the new establishment. The matter of further promotions to fill vacancies that existed prior to this date, which had not been sanctioned, is constantly kept under review.</P>
    <P>Since the 1 September 1999, the following is a list of authorised Permanent Defence Force promotions and the current status in each of the NCO ranks:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 3,500 personnel currently registered as being illegally absent for periods in excess of one year. However, some of these cases were originally recorded as being illegally absent quite some time ago and, in some cases, as far back as 1945. It follows that many of these individuals would now in fact either be very advanced in years or be deceased.</P>
      <P>An &ldquo;illegal absentee&rdquo; is anyone who is registered as being in excess of 21 days absent from the Defence Forces. On being registered as being illegally absent, notification is sent by the unit concerned to the Military Police and to the Garda inspector of the district in which the individual would normally reside.</P>
      <P>Thereafter, in consultation with the Garda, the Military Police will visit the last known address of the individual and, if found, he/she will be detained by the Military Police and returned to his/her unit.</P>
      <P>The procedure in military law with regard to such absentees is that a court of inquiry is held pursuant to section 147 of the Defence Act in respect of each such absentee. A record would exist in the service books of each unit to the effect that the person concerned had been declared to be absent without leave from a specific date. Pursuant to the provisions of section 135(2)(b) of the Defence Act, that person is also presumed to have deserted the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>There is a simple procedure available for long-term absentees to surrender themselves and for trial to be dispensed with. Furthermore a pragmatic approach is taken to the question of using powers against long-term absentees, particularly those who are advanced in years. The military authorities have pointed out that one must realise however, that due consideration will be given to the duration of the absence from the Defence Forces before recommending the dispensing of a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I should, however, clarify that contrary to recent erroneous press reports, the military authorities have not introduced an amnesty for illegal absentees and each case is treated on its merits in accordance with the procedures already outlined. The military authorities do however consider all relevant mitigating circumstances put forward in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The re-organisation of the medical corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, was embraced as an opportunity to redirect the focus of military medical care in the Defence Forces from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support would continue to be further developed.</P>
      <P>Nurses of the Army nursing service have taken up new appointments as members of occupational care teams in the Air Corps and Naval Service and it is planned that more nurses will be offered similar appointments in the larger barracks throughout the country, within the next year or two.</P>
      <P>Medical equipment is the subject of a continuing replacement and upgrading programme. Equipment being purchased this year includes spirometers and new vision screening instruments. Financial provision is being made for the purchase in 2001 of new field medical equipment, to support future peacekeeping missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key financial and managerial reforms set out in the strategic management initiative was to establish a system of expenditure reviews in all areas of public spending. The main purpose of these reviews is to ensure the most <Col N="1129" /> efficient use of resources by Departments within the financial envelopes agreed by Government. For instance, the White Paper and the completion of special studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service constitute very substantial policy and expenditure reviews in the Defence area. In addition, an interdepartmental group has also carried out a comprehensive review of the present arrangements for the provision of medical services for the Defence Forces. Their report has recently been completed and submitted to the central steering committee for the expenditure review programme for evaluation. I will be considering their recommendations shortly when this process is complete.</P>
    <P>In addition, as Deputies will be well aware, the wider body of health services which serve the general public are constantly reviewed. Therefore, I fully accept the need regularly to examine, and where necessary to re-evaluate, the services provided by the Medical Corps to ensure that these services, provided for military personnel, match those provided elsewhere and that they are provided in the most cost efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>A substantial proportion of the representative associations' annual income derives from the weekly or monthly subscriptions paid by their members. These subscriptions are deducted at source by my Department. For the year ending 31 December 1999, total deductions from pay were as follows: &ndash; RACO, Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, £184,000; PDFORRA, Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, £846,000; RDFRA, Reserve Defence Force Representative Association), £30,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to this income, my Department provides the following facilities and funding to the associations, RACO is provided with serviced office accommodation without charge and has access to the Department's telephone network for internal and external calls without charge; PDFORRA, receives an annual subvention of £54,000 towards the cost of its office accommodation; RDFRA is provided with free office accommodation and receives an annual subvention of £41,000 in respect of staff costs, travel and subsistence expenses, and postage and telephone charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RACO and PDFORRA have agreed arrangements in place to provide for the release of military personnel for the purpose of attending association business, including training, at both local and national levels. In 1997, I agreed to pro <Col N="1130" /> vide funding to RACO for the provision of a researcher and in 1998 a similar arrangement was agreed with RDFRA. I have recently agreed to provide some funding for partnership training.</P>
    <P>No request for funding in respect of extra training for representative association officials is currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of paramount importance. Safety issues are monitored on an ongoing basis by the military authorities. Any necessary work to ensure the continued safety of Defence Forces personnel in carrying out their various tasks will be carried out with my full backing as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>Following recent media reports, I was advised that an internal report had been prepared by Air Corps personnel for the military authorities dealing with the issue of crash rescue services at Air Corps installations. The report suggested that the crash rescue services at these bases were inadequate.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I take all safety issues very seriously. I arranged for an immediate briefing by senior military officers, including the General Officer commanding the Air Corps. The meeting took place on 10 October. At the briefing, I was presented with a copy of the internal military report. I received categoric assurances from the senior military officers present that any shortcomings identified in the report were being dealt with as a matter of urgency. I was also assured that there are no other safety questions of which I am not aware.</P>
      <P>In this regard, last May, I raised with the military authorities the issue of a fire tender for Finner Camp, County Donegal where the Air Corps operate a Dauphin helicopter for search and rescue purposes. I undertook to have the fire tender provided and I instructed the military authorities, to whom responsibility for these types of purchases has been delegated for some time now, to initiate a tender process to acquire a new fire tender for Finner Camp. The fire tender is scheduled for delivery early next year. A new tender is also on order for Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity at the meeting to again impress to the senior military officers and the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps that safety standards in both equipment and facilities are of paramount importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment.</P>

      <P>The Government supports the transparent and open approach regarding access to EU information which is embodied in the Amsterdam Treaty. Restrictions on the availability of information should be kept to a necessary minimum. However, there is also a need to ensure the protection of certain sensitive information.</P>
      <P>A decision of the EU Secretary-General/High Representative on 27 July and an interim decision of the European Council on 14 August entered into force, on a provisional basis, on the latter date. The effect of these decisions was to restrict public access to certain categories of EU Council secretariat documentation which concern the development of the European Union's means for military and non-military crisis management.</P>
      <P>The decisions in question have been adopted on a provisional basis to ensure the protection of certain classified material in the security and defence area, so as to facilitate progress in the elaboration of a European security and defence policy. In due course, longer term arrangements are to be adopted in accordance with Article 255 of the EU Treaty, as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty. Article 255 provides for a right of access by citizens to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, subject to general principles and limits to be determined by the Council.</P>
      <P>Against this background, a large majority of member states, including Ireland, accepted the interim decisions which came into effect earlier this year, made on the advice of Secretary General/High Representative Solana. The conclusion of definitive arrangements for access to documents can be expected by May 2001 in accordance with the timescale specified in the treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with UNIFIL since 1978. On 18 October 2000 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL comprising approximately 620 personnel all ranks for a six month period beginning 30 October 2000. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of approximately 620 personnel all ranks to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peacekeeping force beyond January 2001 in the event of the further extension of the UNIFIL mandate beyond that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the UN Security Council every six months. In July 2000 the Security Council extended the mandate for a period of six months to 31 January, 2001, the matter to be reviewed by the Security Council in early November on foot of a report to be furnished by the Secretary General by 31 October 2000. The report will examine the progress made by UNIFIL towards completion of the tasks assigned to it in the original 1978 mandate.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 3 October 2000 the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon was effectively completed between 22-24 May 2000. Following the withdrawal, UNIFIL began conducting extensive patrols in armoured vehicles in the former Israeli controlled area. In response to a request from the United Nations for additional troops and support personnel, the Government conveyed approval on 3 May 2000, for the deployment of an extra 50 personnel to augment the 87th Irish Battalion until the end of its tour of duty in October 2000 as well as for the deployment of an engineer party, together with necessary equipment, to undertake essential construction work in the Irishbatt area of operations.</P>
    <P>The extra 50 personnel joined the Irish contingent in June 2000. Four Panhard AML 90s were also sent to the Irishbatt area of operations in response to a UN request. In addition, UNIFIL supplied Irishbatt with a further five armoured personnel carriers, APCs, to meet additional patrol taskings which arose as a result of the Israeli withdrawal. The extra personnel were employed in crewing the extra APCs as well as supplying additional medical support. In August 2000 50 Defence Forces engineering personnel, together with their equipment, joined the contingent in order to construct new posts for Irishbatt personnel in the former Israeli controlled area, close to the Blue Line or border with Israel. These personnel are scheduled to complete their task by the end of this month at which time they will return to Ireland.</P>
    <P>United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 required Israel to end its presence in South Lebanon. UNIFIL was established in 1978 to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.</P>
    <P>The matter of Defence Forces continued participation in UNIFIL will be kept under continual review. Following the review of the situation by the UN Security Council early next month the future perspective for UN engagement in South Lebanon may become clearer.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the situation continues to be calm in the Irishbatt area of operations.</P>

The military board which is developing the integrated personnel management system has submitted a second interim report to the general staff in August 2000 and submission of the final draft report is expected at the end of December this year. Implementation of the plan, once approved, will commence in 2001. Concurrent development of a career skills training policy for other ranks personnel which will combine with the integrated personnel management system is ongoing at Defence Force Headquarters level.</P>

      <P>Regular contact with home helps to sustain the high morale of our personnel serving overseas and facilitating communication with home is seen as a priority.</P>
      <P>All personnel serving overseas are entitled to one free five minute 'phone call per month. Special arrangements are provided in relation to duration of calls for personnel serving on isolated missions or in places where there is no local telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In the case of personnel serving with Unifil, the United Nations provides free postal facilities to Ireland for letters and small parcels. Each person is allowed five aerogrammes home per week. For personnel serving with Untaet in East Timor, arrangements have been made to provide for five free airmail letters per week per person. These arrangements cater for the majority of personnel serving with overseas missions.</P>
      <P>In the event of emergency domestic situations arising for personnel serving overseas, action is taken to notify the personnel involved without delay.

In the case of officers who are accompanied by their spouses but who have children in full-time education in Ireland, the vouched cost of two return journeys per annum may be paid for the children to visit their parents, if the posting is of 12 months or longer duration. Alternatively, either or both parents may return home in which case a contribution equal to the combined cost of the fares of the eligible children may be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The management structures of the Department of Defence have changed substantially in recent years. In 1996, the Defence Forces strategic management committee was established arising from the reviews undertaken in the defence area at that time and has met some 14 times to date. This built on the existing more informal arrangements for addressing joint civil-military issues.</P>
      <P>The strategic management committee, SMC, provides an important forum for the discussion of all major policy issues. It is chaired by the Secretary General and its other members are the Chief of Staff, the two deputy chiefs of staff and the two assistant secretaries of the Department. The general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service also attend in respect of items affecting their services.</P>
      <P>It was decided that following the White Paper on Defence that the role of the SMC will be enhanced by means of a greater emphasis on strategic planning and on policy formulation and review. A more proactive role for the SMC will help to maintain a shared understanding of the policy objectives facing the Defence organisation with a view to ensuring that the Minister has the best possible advice available to him. It is envisaged that the SMC will now meet on a monthly basis and I propose to chair quarterly meetings. The first of these is scheduled to take place shortly.</P>

Positive professional working civil-military relations have always been a feature of defence management and this will continue to be the case.

      <P>The terms of the non-contributory pension scheme for civilian employees with the Defence Forces, and unestablished civil servants in my Department, are applicable to all non-established State employees across all Departments. The scheme provides for the payment of a pension and retirement lump sum on retirement, subject to certain service criteria. In addition, by virtue of their PRSI contributions, those employees in my Department who are covered by the terms of the non-contributory occupational pension scheme would also be eligible for a contributory retirement &ndash; old age pension from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs. The occupational pension scheme is designed to ensure that, for an employee with &ldquo;full&rdquo; service, 40 years, his/her total pension benefit, social insurance pension plus occupational pension, would amount to 50% of pensionable remuneration. Moreover, if the employee concerned has dependants, his or her total benefit would be in excess of 50% of pensionable remuneration.</P>
      <P>The pension terms of public servants employed in a number of areas, including those serving as civilian employees with the Defence Forces and as unestablished civil servants in my Department, are currently being examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. I understand that the report of the commission is expected to be presented to the Minister for Finance shortly and the Government will then consider the recommendations, if any, of the commission regarding the pension terms of those employees in my Department who are covered by the terms of the occupational non-contributory pension scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the possible use of St. Bricin's Military Hospital for civilian patients was first mooted in late 1997, following contacts between military medical staff and the Mater Hospital. Agreement in principle was reached in 1998 between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on a proposal to use part of St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred from the Mater Hospital. My Department agreed to a pilot scheme with the intention of entering into a long-term arrangement for accommodating civilian patients at St. Bricin's Hospital, if the pilot scheme proved successful.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has overall responsibility for the proposal. Accordingly, before any pilot scheme can commence, it is essential that the Department of Health and Children is fully satisfied with regard to all the arrangements surrounding the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients in St. Bricin's Hospital. I am informed that proposals were made by the Mater Hospital to the Department of Health and Children with regard to the use of St. Bricin's Hospital. While it was accepted that these proposals had merit, I am informed that a number of important issues still required clarification such as legal and insurance issues which are in the remit of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 March 2000 the new Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, is the statutory body with responsibility for health and personal social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The ERHA is currently examining the accident and emergency services and hospital waiting lists in their region with a view to bringing forward recommendations to improve services and address existing deficiencies in these areas of service provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> In the context of this review, the Department of Health and Children has asked my Department to consider providing access to the patient accommodation facilities at St. Bricin's Hospital. The exact nature and details of such a collaboration are currently under discussion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 209 together.</P>
      <P>The number of Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas is 951. Details of the various missions in which Defence Force personnel are currently serving are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report. This figure includes 50 additional personnel who were deployed in June 2000 to augment the 87th Irish Battalion following the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon as well as an engineering party of 50 personnel deployed in August 2000 to construct a number of new positions for Irishbatt in the former Israeli controlled area. These personnel are due to return home at the end of this month and will not be replaced in the 88th Irish Battalion.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House previously, Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to the United Nations stand-by arrangements system, UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under UNSAS. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>

    <P>The matter of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. There exists a standing inter-departmental committee on peacekeeping, under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs whose function, <i>inter alia</i>, is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy in this are a and to ensure that policy and its implementation can keep pace in a co-ordinated way with development in international peacekeeping. In addition, as I have indicated earlier today, when bringing proposals regarding Ireland's contribution to the headline goal to Government shortly, I propose to include the results of a completed review of the commitments of the Defence Forces to overseas tasks, as provided for in the White paper on Defence. This review will take account, <i>inter alia</i>, <Col N="1140" /> of the developing situation in UNIFIL in the post Israeli withdrawal situation.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL has been Ireland's longest and largest peace support contribution spanning a period of over twenty years. It is expected that the UN is likely to maintain a continuing role in Lebanon for some time. The nature and extent of this role will become clearer following a review early next month of the situation which the UN Security Council has decided to undertake following the presentation of a report in the matter by UN Security General at the end of this month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164, 165 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. Statistics on employment and unemployment are compiled, at a regional level, from the quarterly national household survey. The latest statistics show that there were 19,000 people classified as unemployed in the Dublin region in the March-May quarter of 2000, compared with 25,400 in the corresponding quarter of 1999. This represents an annual fall of just over 25%. Sub-regional statistics, of the kind requested by the Deputy, are not available from the quarterly national household survey.</P>
      <P>The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by postal district is not available.</P>
      <P>While the live register provides a regular monthly series, it is not an accurate measure of unemployment, as it includes part-time workers, who may work up to three days per week, seasonal and casual workers who are to unemployment assistance or benefit.</P>
      <P>The live register figures for each social welfare office in Dublin in September 1999 and 2000 are set out in the following table:</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The homemaker's scheme can enable persons who give up work to care for a child under 12 years of age or an incapacitated child/adult age 12 years or over, to qualify for an old age, contributory, pension on reaching pensionable age. To be considered as a homemaker under the scheme persons must not be engaged in full-time employment, however, they can earn up to £30 gross per week.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme, CE, is a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. Eligibility for CE is confined to persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows-widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme. On the above basis persons on the homemaker's scheme are not eligible for CE.</P>
      <P>However, in response to the recent recommendation of the report of the Partnership 2000 working group on women's access to labour market opportunities, my Department is considering the position of persons on carer's allowance with a view to accepting an appropriate period in receipt of the carer's allowance as eligibility for CE. This would facilitate persons on low income whose caring duties have ceased to return to the workforce. Persons in receipt of the carer's allowance are automatically registered on the homemaker's scheme by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>CE is a very popular programme and limited resources do not make it possible to provide places for all unemployed persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the question put by the Deputy is as follows: the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 2000, which was enacted in July, 2000, awaits commencement. It is expected that commencement will take place before end-year. The commencement order has not yet been made because it will be necessary to make a number of other orders and regulations prior to commencement in order to ensure that various elements of the legislation are capable of operating in practice. The terms and scope of these orders are currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Section 2(2) of the Competition Act, 1991, provided, <i>inter alia</i> that different days could be fixed for the repeal for different purposes of any provision of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972. To date no commencement order has been made providing for the repeal of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, an order made under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>Recommendation Number 40 of the final report of the competition and mergers review group, received by me earlier this year was to the effect that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, be repealed.</P>
      <P>I will make my position on that matter known when I have completed my deliberations on the report.</P>
      <P>Sections 248 and 249 of the Companies Act, 1990, provide for matters relating to the delivery of documents to the Registrar of Companies in legible and non-legible form. The commencement of section 248 has recently been requested by the registrar and is being considered. The need to commence Section 249 will be reviewed in the light of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>Sections 46 to 52 inclusive, 68(1)(c), 120(5) and 122(1)(f) of the Credit Union Act, 1997, have not yet been commenced. Consideration will be given to their commencement on foot of a request to do so from the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, following that Office's discussions, which are ongoing, with the credit union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commencement Orders in respect of sections 18, 19, 20, 36, 37 and 38 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998, have not been made. The staff of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are currently employees of Forfás on terms and conditions which provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for superannuation benefits. The above provisions would allow for the separate employment by these agencies of their own staff and for necessary provision of superannuation benefits to those staff. I have no immediate plans to bring these provisions into effect. In regard to commencement of section 50 of the Act, transfer of staff from Forfás to NSAI, there are ongoing discussions between all the parties concerned in regard to the transfer of the staff of Forfás, who are currently assigned to the National Metrology Laboratory, to the National Standards Authority <Col N="1146" /> of Ireland, which I expect to be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, which was sponsored by the Minister for Public Enterprise, was signed into law by the President on 2 December 1998. Detailed Regulations, which are necessary to give operational effect to the provisions of the Act, are currently being prepared by the Health and Safety Authority, in co-operation with my Department and in consultation with all relevant interested parties. The regulations are complex and involve roles and responsibilities for a number of Government Departments and other public bodies in order to ensure their adequate implementation and enforcement. The preparatory work is now awaiting finalisation of Department of Environment and Local Government input and as soon as the regulations are finalised the necessary order to bring the Act into operation will be made.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, (No. 10 of 1972) dealing with provisions in relation to the safety of explosives has not been commenced. This part, <i>inter alia</i>, would make the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, rather than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, responsible for explosives safety and the making of Regulations in connection with same. The issue of State security has delayed the commencement order on this part of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, automatically repealed specific provisions of existing enactments on safety and health, that is Factories Act, 1955, Safety in Industry Act, 1980, Office Premises Act, 1958, Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979, and the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987, from 1 November 1989, both in relation to sections as a whole, or certain provisions relating to penalties. The section, in conjunction with section 1(2), also provides for the repeal of all remaining provisions of these enactments, together with the Boiler Explosions Acts, 1882 and 1890, subject to the making of Commencement Orders under section 1 (2) of the Act in respect of any of those enactments or any of their provisions.</P>
    <P>Three such Repeals Orders have been made to date including the Safety, Health and Welfare at work (Repeals and Revocations) Order, 1995, (S.I. No. 357 of 1995). This order, <i>inter alia</i>, repealed the Office Premises Act, 1958, in full and repealed 46 sections in full and seven sections partially of the Factories Act, 1955. The order also revoked 55 sets of regulations in full and partially revoked 12 sets of regulations made under a range of statutes. The purpose of the exercise was to avoid overlapping or duplication between different statutory provisions and to remove enactments that had become obsolete. The legislation is currently under review to identify further provisions that may be considered for repeal at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> The Cement (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1999, was passed by both Houses on 18 October 2000 and has been sent to the President for signature. It is intended to make a Commencement Order without delay after enactment.</P>

      <P>The Donegal initiative programme was set up to address the employment and retraining needs of 1,596 workers who were made redundant in the county following a number of significant company closures and rationalisations.</P>
      <P>A skills analysis of the redundant workforce was compiled by FÁS when the workers became redundant. The analysis report was circulated to the industrial development agencies and to potential investors, with a view to securing employment for the workers.</P>
      <P>The position of the redundant workers in the Donegal initiative programme, as at 20 October 2000, was as follows: made redundant 1,596; registered with FÁS &ndash; 1,315; received FÁS training &ndash; 285; still on live register &ndash; 198.</P>
      <P>The skills imparted to the redundant workforce through FÁS training is registered on each individual's file in FÁS. The additional skills acquired are mainly in information technology, teleservices, childcare and care of the elderly. Any further retraining required will be provided by FÁS.</P>
      <P>Those who are still on the live register will be provided with intensive support by FÁS to improve their employability, upon referral from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The ongoing needs of the labour force in Donegal are ascertained through FÁS's employment, occupational guidance and training services. These services are available at permanent FÁS offices throughout Donegal and at FÁS outreach facilities for communities distant from the main FÁS locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS is currently completing interviews with 165 workers due to become redundant at the Fruit of the Loom plant in Ballymacarry, Buncrana, in November 2000. A skills analysis <Col N="1148" /> report is being compiled for this workforce and FÁS will provide training courses tailored to their needs.</P>

      <P>Draft net salmon fishing in the Erne Estuary in 2000 is regulated by way of the Salmon and Trout Conservation Bye-law No. 766, 2000. The fishing season opened on 1 July and closed on 31 July during which period fishing was allowed four days per week and 24 hours per day.</P>
      <P>Salmon stocks remain vulnerable and I propose to maintain all the conservation measures currently in place. It remains the case that where commercial netsmen and anglers working with the regional fisheries boards can agree a management plan for specific areas, the possibility of altering the season in those areas will be reviewed in consultation with the National Salmon Commission.</P>

      <P>The ice plant at Bunbeg, owned by BIM, was installed in 1992 and leased, on a commercial basis, to the local fishermen's association. I understand from BIM that demand for ice from the facility has been at such a low level that production has been minimal since its installation.</P>
      <P>Operating the plant at such low production levels, has made the cost of producing ice prohibitive and has placed a strain on the resources of the fishermen's association as the lessee. Given the operational costs and overheads, it is not economically viable for either the local fishermen or for BIM to operate the Bunbeg plant.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the association, BIM's decision to remove the facility from Bunbeg has been notified to the fishermen. The relatively small demand for ice can be adequately serviced from the BIM ice plant at nearby Burtonport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keenly aware that the disease of HIV-AIDS is causing extreme suffering and hardship for many individuals and their dependants in Uganda. Out of an overall population of 21.2 million, approximately 1.9 million Ugandans are infected with HIV according to the Uganda Poverty Status Report 2000. AIDS has been reported as one of the leading causes of death in adults and there were an estimated 1.7 million AIDS orphans in Uganda by the end of last year. Life expectancy in Uganda has fallen from 48 to 42 in the last decade and the HIV-AIDS epidemic has been the major factor in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> The extent of this problem and the impact it is having on development in Uganda and throughout sub-Saharan Africa requires a substantive and coherent response from the international community and from governments of affected countries. Though now late in the epidemic, there is at this point a much greater global recognition of the extent of the disease and as a result, a substantive volume of international resources has been mobilised for HIV-AIDS prevention and containment.</P>
    <P>The Government of Uganda responded early and comprehensively to the problem of HIV-AIDS in Uganda and the President has never wasted an opportunity to highlight the extent of the problem of HIV-AIDS and the need for a systematic and sustained response. Since the early 1990's, the Government has instituted a multi-sectoral response to HIV-AIDS that has resulted in a very significant decrease in the annual incidence of the disease. Recent data would indicate that the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in Uganda has decreased from over 14% of adults in the early 1990's to approx. 9% in 1999.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition also in Uganda that HIV-AIDS will continue to present a huge challenge to poverty reduction and development for many years ahead and that attempts to control the disease will need to be sustained. Furthermore, the response of the government of Uganda to HIV-AIDS is now being highlighted by the international community as an example to be followed by other poorer countries being faced with a similar burden of HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>A specific HIV-AIDS strategy was launched by Minister of State, Liz O'Donnell in January 2000, in response to the huge threat HIV-AIDS presents to the development of countries which benefit from the support of the Irish Government's bilateral aid programme, known as Ireland Aid. This strategy provides for the allocation of a very considerable volume of resources for HIV-AIDS activities across the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    <P>Uganda is one of Ireland Aid's six priority countries. Ireland Aid has allocated substantive financial resources in support of HIV-AIDS interventions in Uganda over the next three years, in line with its overall HIV-AIDS strategy and in response to the huge challenge of HIV-AIDS in Uganda. In addition, very substantial resources have been allocated for the development of the health sector. Clearly financial resources will be directed to interventions that are demonstrated to be effective and that are situated within the framework of the Government of Uganda's national strategic framework for HIV-AIDS activities. This framework has been agreed between Government, international agencies and civil society organisations.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate at this juncture, during the week in which the President of Uganda is paying a State visit to Ireland, to congratulate President Museveni publicly on the excellent leadership he has demonstrated, within Africa, in <Col N="1154" /> the wake of the enormous threat posed by this disease. Our Government remains committed to working closely with his Government and civil society in Uganda in addressing this disease and will ensure that support for HIV-AIDS remains an important part of our programme of cooperation with Uganda.</P>
    <P>In addition to support for HIV-AIDS interventions undertaken by the Government and civil society in Uganda, Ireland Aid has a budget this year of £7.37 million available to Irish aid organisations, under its co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations, for development projects which meet basic needs such as primary health care. Following the Taoiseach's recent announcement at the UN Millennium Summit in New York of the Government's commitment to reach the UN development target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007, it is anticipated that funding available to Irish aid organisations under the co-financing scheme will increase from next year.</P>

      <P>The amount of Exchequer subvention for CIE as published in the Estimates for the year 2000 is £115.181 million. The subvention is paid to CIE rather than to the individual companies in respect of the provision of socially necessary, non-commercial public transport services. The allocation of this subvention to the individual subsidiary companies is a matter for the CIE board. As the subvention is not based on detailed costings per route or on per passenger carried, it is not possible to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of increasing the State subsidy to CIE to 5p per passenger carried.</P>
      <P>There is no capital element to the subvention.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the concept of significant market power in the context of deregulation in the telecommunications industry and specifically unbundling of the copper local loop; and whether it unfairly discriminates against Eircom in so far as cable operators are not obliged to unbundle their network which is concentrated in the large urban areas and is significantly easier to service and access than Eircom networks and consequently more lucrative financially.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals contained in the draft EU Regulation on Unbundled Access to the Local Loop do not, in my view, discriminate unfairly against operators designated as having significant market power in the provision of fixed public telephone networks, such as Eircom.</P>
      <P>The concept of significant market power was established as part of the existing EU regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector. It is designed to allow national regulators impose specific requirements on operators with significant market power in particular markets to ensure the development of those markets and the growth of competition in the sector.</P>
      <P>In general, under this framework, an organisation is presumed to have significant market power when it has a share of more than 25% of a particular telecommunications market in the geographical area in a member state in which it is authorised to operate. The particular markets to which this may apply comprise the markets for interconnection, public mobile telephony, fixed public telephony networks and services, and leased lines.</P>
      <P>The scope of the draft EU Regulation on Unbundled Access to the Local Loop is limited to dealing with unbundling of the local loop of those operators identified as having significant market power in the fixed public telephone network market. In Ireland's case this, as of now, means Eircom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals contained in the draft regulation do not cover networks of cable television companies. While steps are being taken by cable operators to upgrade their networks, they are not yet seen as having the same functionality and ubiguity as the copper local loop. However, this does not mean that they will not be obliged to offer access to their networks at some future stage <Col N="1156" /> should be conditions at the time justify such an obligation. Unbundling obligations may be imposed on operators of networks like cable if, in the future, they are shown to have significant market power in a relevant access market and where the conditions at the time justify such an obligation. This will be possible under the proposed EU Communications Regulatory Framework to come into place by 2003 which, <i>inter alia,</i> will replace the proposed regulation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Questions Nos. 75, 76 and 81 on 19 October, 2000.</P>
      <P>Iarnrod Eireann has informed me that work on the doubling of the existing single track between Clonsilla and Maynooth completed by the end of this year. The company also expects that additional services will be introduced in early January 2001 and the draft schedule for these services reflects a fifty percent increase on current service levels during peak periods.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to disabled or mobility impaired people within the overall resources available to them.</P>
      <P>Up to now wheelchair accessible buses have been acquired exclusively for urban services. However, I am happy to say that Bus Éireann has placed an order for twenty low floor wheelchair accessible buses which they propose to use on rural services. These buses are due to be delivered by the end of this year and they will be tested on a number of rural routes throughout the country. I understand that the performance of the vehicles will be evaluated, particularly in relation to their operation over what may be difficult operating terrain and conditions for low floor buses.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the national development plan of £3.5 million for the development of pilot public transport initiatives in rural areas. The aim will be to encourage local or community-based initiatives to provide bus services in these areas. The projects to be funded will be selected following a national call for proposals.</P>
      <P>The criteria under which proposals may be considered will be elaborated on in a discussion document which it is intended to publish before the end of this year. The question of accessibility to transport for mobility impaired and disabled people will be taken into account in the preparation of these criteria.</P>

      <Quest>the budgetary provision she has made in the 2000 Estimates to meet the cost of the home insulation programme recently costed in a report by energy action at £1,300 million over ten years; and her plans to expand spending in this area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy which my Department published late last year recommended a substantial increase in our efforts to increase energy efficiency among targeted consumer sectors. This initiative has been followed through in the national development plan where £146 million has been allocated for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures over the period up to 2006. On average, this works out as a tenfold increase in the Exchequer provision for this area. In the 2000 estimates, £6.2 million in total has been allocated for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures.</P>
      <P>The approach set out in the Green Paper for the residential sector is to stimulate consumer awareness of energy efficiency in such housing stock and to establish an energy rating system which would encourage house purchasers to undertake insulation work in their own interest. £7.2 million has been allocated in the national development plan to establish a home energy rating system. In addition, £6 million has been allocated in the national development plan towards the achievement of basic standards of insulation and energy efficiency services for low income households. The resources of the Irish Energy Centre are in the course of being increased significantly to allow for the delivery of this greatly expanded programme.</P>
      <P>The report Homes for the 21st Century prepared by the energy research group, UCD on behalf of Energy Action Limited will also be of valuable assistance in designing the measures for this sector.</P>
      <P>My Department continues to financially support the work of Energy Action Limited, which is working to combat fuel poverty by installing energy efficiency material in low income households.</P>

      <P>Air Corps cadets undergo six months basic military orientation in the cadet school before reporting to the Air Corps to commence flying training and complete officer training. The duration of the flying training course is approximately eighteen months and successful cadets are conferred with &ldquo;Wings&rdquo; and commissioned as second-lieutenants in the Air Corps. Eleven Air Corps cadets who are nearing completion of training are due to be commissioned as second-lieutenants and be conferred with &ldquo;Wings&rdquo; at a ceremony in Baldonnel on 10 November next.</P>
      <P>In addition to the cadets due to be commissioned on 10 November, there are presently two Air Corps cadet classes in training &ndash; one class of 12 in the Cadet School, Military College, Defence Forces Training Centre who have recently started basic military training and the second class of 13 cadets in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel who are undergoing flight training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flying training course is divided into three phases &ndash; elementary, basic and advanced. The aircraft used on the elementary and basic phases is the Marchetti. Training for the advanced phase is carried on both the Gazelle helicopter and the <Col N="1160" /> Beechcraft. All flying training for cadets is conducted at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>As has been the policy for many years, maximum advantage is taken of the availability abroad of aircraft simulators for the training of flying officers. These simulators principally allow for inexpensive training of normal operational techniques as well as a full range of emergency procedures without risk to aircraft or crew.</P>
    <P>The use of hired simulators represents very good value for money as skills and procedures are learned at a fraction of the cost of operating the actual aircraft type. Meanwhile the service aircraft remains available for operational tasks for the maximum amount of time.</P>
    <P>About 20 officers train abroad each year on Gulfstream IV in the US, Beech King Air 200 in France and CASA Cn235n in Spain.</P>

The second new ship will replace LE <i>Deirdre</i> as it approaches the end of its economic life.</P>
      <P>The total cost of these vessels will represent investment of about £44 million.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 73 of 10 October 2000 my Department has put proposals to the three bodies which had been approved to inspect organic crop produce under Regulation 2091-92, Demeter Standards Limited, Irish Organic Farmers and <Col N="1164" /> Growers Association and Organic Trust, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. There is no suggestion that the three bodies should cease to exist. I have already expressed my appreciation of the contribution they have made to the development of the organic sector and I look forward to working with them in the future.</P>
      <P>Since putting its proposals to the three bodies, my Department has since had a number of meetings and other contacts with them to give further clarification. Furthermore, at their request, my Department has agreed to assist with funding to engage a facilitator to assist the three bodies in their negotiations with one another. A considerable amount of time and effort has been expended to date in endeavouring to assist the three bodies to arrive at a resolution of issues associated with the establishment of a unified inspection and certification system. I understand the three bodies are still considering my Department's proposals and I am hopeful for an early and positive response. As the new Regulation 1804/1999 has already come into effect, final decisions on the practical aspects of its application must be taken as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of standards to apply in Ireland, discussions have been held with the three organic farming bodies. A number of groups of organic producers have made approaches to my Department and discussions have also taken place with other bodies in the public and private sectors. Following these discussions, my Department has moved significantly to address a number of points which appeared to give rise to concern and has indicated that other issues may be considered subsequently by the organic development committee which is being established in accordance with the recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 committee. As a result, additional standards to those required by EU regulations will now apply to the organic livestock sector in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to bear in mind, however, the fact that produce certified as organic by the competent authorities in other EU member states cannot be excluded from the Irish market. My Department's information, from direct contact with other competent authorities, is that at least six other member states are adopting national standards which are equivalent to those set down in Regulation 1804/1999 or are otherwise less restrictive than those recommended by the three Irish organic farming bodies. While private certification bodies in certain member states may apply their own additional standards, it will be open to producers and processors to obtain certification to the minimum national standard from the competent authorities in those states and to market their produce as organic throughout the EU. In the market for organic produce, as else<Col N="1165" /> where, the consumer ultimately make his or her own choices.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to standards, and other matters relating to the organic food sector in Ireland, will of course form part of the deliberations of the organic development committee. I am seeking to ensure that the committee includes representatives of the widest interests in the organic sector &ndash; including those involved in production, marketing, distribution and retailing, as well as the areas of research, training, advice and regulation. The remit of the committee is to recommend a coherent developing strategy to achieve expansion in production, processing and marketing of Irish organic produce and to secure an increased share of the growing national and export markets; and to consider the broad actions necessary for the most advantageous long-term future development of the Irish organic sector while protecting its integrity. I envisage that the organic development committee will convene for the first time in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The AgriFood 2010 report included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2091/91. When Regulation 1804/99 covering the livestock sector was introduced on 24 August, my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulation.</P>
    <P>Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has moved significantly to address a number of points of concern and other issues may be considered subsequently by the organic development committee.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for special beef premium, a producer must be a registered herdowner whose holding is situated within the State. A &ldquo;holding&rdquo; is defined as all the production units managed by a producer. Each producer is obliged to comply with the 180 head limit per category regardless of the number of herd numbers allocated to that individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>To protect and develop our vital lamb trade it is essential that Ireland now puts in place a workable, credible and reliable system of sheep identification. Factors influencing this requirement include: the recommendation of the sheepmeat forum, which recognised the need for a sheep traceability system; market developments, most notably the introduction in Britain with effect from 1 January 2001 of a tag based identification system; the increasingly important need for identification and traceability for disease control purposes; the universally recognised unsatisfactory nature of our current system; and the general approach at EU level to traceability and identification.</P>
      <P>In designing the system to be put in place my Department has placed the emphasis on simplicity and on minimising both bureaucracy and cost. It is proposed that identification would be by means of tagging and will be based on flock numbers, although farmers will have the option of individually tagging for flock management purposes. All sheep would have to be tagged within six months of birth or on movement off farm, whichever is the sooner.</P>
      <P>My officials have just completed a full round of briefing and consultative meetings with the various farmer and other representative organisations with a view to implementation of the sheep identification scheme in March 2001 and is considering a number of practical issues raised. My Department will be working with all relevant organisations in progressing this item and all necessary advice and information will be given to farmers well in advance.</P>

      <P>In the Finance Act 1999, I introduced accelerated capital allowances of up to 100% for capital expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of park and ride developments in or near designated urban areas which provide parking facilities for commuters using public transport. Relief is also available for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of related residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities. Guidelines on the operation of the scheme were issued by my colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, Minister for Environment and Local Government in August 1999. The guidelines set out various criteria which a park and ride development and residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities must meet in order to qualify under the scheme. The scheme will operate for a three year period from 1 July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1999 Finance Act, also provided for capital allowances for commercial developments located at these park and ride facilities. However, guidelines are not yet available in relation to the commercial development element of these park and ride facilities because this aspect of the scheme was notified to the EU Commission as is required under state aid rules. Guidelines may not issue <Col N="1178" /> until approval is received from the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>Certification of a development for the purposes of obtaining relief under the scheme is carried out by the relevant local authority. The Dublin transportation office has indicated that interest has been expressed by a number of developers who have had pre-planning discussions with them, and it is understood that some schemes are currently being designed. However, on the basis of information to hand, it seems that no local authority has issued a certificate to date.</P>

      <P>According to the 1996 Census, 120,857 persons travel to work by bus and train. On that basis it is estimated that a £500 tax credit per person for using public transport would cost £60.4 million in a full year. This estimate would need to be qualified having regard to the following factors: the degree to which a tax credit would incentivise people to switch to public transport; the numbers now using public transport compared to 1996; the actual cost incurred by people on public transport and the degree to which an additional tax allowance could be absorbed by an individual public transport user having regard to his or her income position and his or her other existing tax allowances or reliefs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that up to date reliable statistics are not yet readily available to enable the cost to the Exchequer of eliminating stamp duty for all first time buyers of houses to be calculated. However, many first time owner-occupier buyers are, at present, either exempt from stamp duty or pay at a reduced rate. The position is as follows. In the Finance (No 2) Act, 2000, I increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 to £150,000 in the case of first-time owner-occupier purchasers. Also, rates of stamp duty for first-time buyers at values in excess of £150,000 and up to £300,000 are now 25% less than for other owner-occupiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner-occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house in such cases is more than 125 square metres, stamp duty <Col N="1179" /> is charged on the site value only, subject to a minimum site value of one quarter of the full house value. In such cases, the £150,000 exemption for a first time owner-occupier purchaser would also apply.</P>
    <P>In increasing the first time buyer limit from £60,000 to £150,000 and in giving a 25% reduction on the other owner occupier category of rates applying between £150,000 and £300,000, I believe I have responded fully, as recently as last June, to the needs of first time buyers. I will keep the position under review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year costs to the Exchequer, by reference to an income tax year based on 2001 incomes, of the change mentioned by the Deputy are estimated as follows: if the personal allowances for single and widowed persons were increased so that the combined total of the single allowance and PAYE allowance was equal to the level of the minimum wage, based on earnings of £4.40 per hour over an assumed standard 39 hour week and with a <i>pro rata </i>increase of double that amount for married persons, the cost would be of the order of £1,098 million; if the PAYE allowance alone was increased to this level, the cost would be in the region of £762 million; this is less costly as self-employed persons and their spouses are not entitled to avail of this allowance and, in addition, the allowance is not doubled for a married one-earner couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of exempting the minimum wage from taxation could also be achieved by increasing the general income tax exemption limit at an estimated cost of approximately £282 million. <Col N="1180" /> This would place a very high number of people in the marginal relief system where the marginal tax rate is 40% and would exacerbate the problems of poverty and employment traps for those wishing to return to work or earn more income. These figures are provisional and are likely to be revised.</P>

      <P>I have contacted the National Lottery Company and have received the following information. The main criteria for selection of a national lottery retail sales agent is as follows: location, type of outlet, opening hours, turnover, traffic-type of customer, number of staff, number of cash points, condition of outlet, proximity of other existing agents, general disposition of applicant, reason for wanting agency, existing scratch cards sales if applicant is seeking lotto, seasonal trade, credit worth, type of tenancy freehold or lease long-term, short-term, application experience in business and owner operated or staff managed business. The same criteria applies to all applicants. The criteria for selecting agents has not changed in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>At present there is no priority rating given to factors involved for consideration as a national lottery agent.

      <P>It is the policy of the National Lottery Company to ensure that good geographical cover and easy access for all our players exists throughout the country. The number of lotto terminals in a particular area depends on various factors, such as, population density, local markets requirements and location, lotto terminals are located where the majority of the local population regularly shops. Unfortunately it is not possible to locate a lotto terminal in every community. The national lottery does its utmost to ensure that the larger villages in rural areas have lotto terminals. The population of each area has been examined to determine the agent network requirements. International norms would have been used as guidelines to carry out this exercise. At present the ratio of lotto agencies and scratch card agencies are 1:1,763 and 1:1,002 respectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> I am aware that the establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service.</P>
    <P>At present personal assistance services are provided as part of a range of home support services, funded by health boards, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. These services are designed to enable people to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. Current policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To date this Government has provided a total of £72.560 million additional funding for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments. This year £7 million development funding has been allocated for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, rising to £14 million in the year 2001. This funding will be primarily targeted at the provision of additional day care places and home support services. To this end, I have targeted £3 million, rising to £6 million in the year 2001, for home support services, which include personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to introduce an independent living fund as a means of funding personal assistance services. Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service agencies, including centres for independent living and service users are represented on these committees.</P>

      <P>The annual cost of employing an additional medical consultant or any consultant, is not standardised as it is dependent on various factors including the number of sessions sanctioned; the number of support staff required; the type of support staff, whether medical, nursing or ancillary; the specialty involved, the agreed level of services being provided by the particular hospital and the type of hospital involved. The numbers of support staff required would be dependent on whether they have to be newly recruited &ndash; for new developments &ndash; or shared with existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, an indicative figure for a consultant, including support staff, including non-pay costs of <Col N="1185" /> drugs or medicines and support services, would be approximately £800,000 per annum in total.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 332 together.</P>
      <P>The cost per bed depends very much on the mix of support services to be considered in making up an average cost.</P>
      <P>The total project cost* of a major teaching and tertiary referral hospital with the full range of support services at October 2000 price base date is in the region of £450,000 per bed.</P>
      <P>The total project cost* of an additional ward bed to a major teaching and tertiary referral hospital at October 2000 price base date is in the region of £100,000 per bed.</P>
      <P>The total project cost* of a long-term community nursing unit with full support services i.e. rehabilitation and catering etc. at October 2000 price base date is in the region of £150,000 per bed.</P>
      <P>*Total project cost includes construction costs, design team fees, equipping and other costs.</P>
      <P>The in-patient revenue cost per bed-day for the 31 acute public hospitals which participated in the national casemix programme in 1998, the latest date for which audited data is available, is detailed in the following table. It should be noted that there are many factors which affect in-patient cost per bed-day and these include the complexity of the workload, teaching obligations, tertiary referrals, etc. The figures exclude costs and activity attributable to day-cases, out-patient services, long-stay cases, dialysis, obstetrics and psychiatry and do not take account of capital costs.</P>
      <P>The cost of maintaining a person in a public nursing unit or long-stay hospital, within which convalescent care can also be provided, varies considerably, from high dependency units at £91 per day to lesser dependency units at £30 daily.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subvention to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subvention would meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. Based on the latest figures available to my Department, there are 6,095 persons in receipt of <Col N="1187" /> nursing home subventions and the budget for the scheme this year is £38.4 million. To increase the rates of subvention by 50% across the three levels of dependency is estimated to cost approximately £17.5 million.</P>
    <P>The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government since 1997 and my priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet the increasing demands on the scheme in respect of rising numbers and growing levels of dependency. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Government policy in regard to services for homeless people is outlined in &ldquo;Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy&rdquo;, which was published in May 2000. The cost of hostel accommodation for homeless adults is shared between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with the responsibility of the provision of staff being a matter for the health boards. There are considerable variations in the numbers of staff required for such units depending on variations in client profile, variations in numbers of clients and level of care required. It is currently estimated that the salary costs of providing a hostel place for a homeless person can range from £5,000 for low level support up to £36,000 if the individual is being supported in a high level support hostel for drug users or chronic street drinkers.</P>

      <P>Section 50, subsection (7) of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998 (No. 29 of 1998) has not yet commenced.

      <P>The Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, was not brought into force as its provisions were overtaken by provisions in international law which require different safeguards against improper detention than those provided under the Act. The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas will provide for such safeguards and will repeal the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the North-Western Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of that board. I have had inquiries made of the board who inform me that orthodontic services are provided in specially designated departments in both Sligo General and Letterkenny General Hospitals. The services are under the overall direction and supervision of a consultant orthodontist who attends both hospitals.</P>
      <P>In addition to the consultant orthodontist the health board has the services of two dentists with specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Since 1999, the board also has the services of a specialist orthodontic registrar.</P>
      <P>Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I am providing an additional £0.150 million to the Northern-Western Health Board on an on-going basis to further the development of their orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board has made numerous efforts to recruit additional dentists with specialist training in orthodontics whose numbers are limited nationally. This difficulty has led to an increase in the waiting list numbers. The board is also actively pursuing a number of options such as recruiting abroad to expand the complement of staff providing the service. If successful, these efforts should have a positive impact on the orthodontic waiting lists and lead to a reduction in waiting times.</P>
      <P>The existing consultant orthodontist is due to retire in the near future. Interviews to fill the resultant vacancy have been held at the Local Appointments Commission and the board is awaiting their outcome.</P>
      <P>At my invitation the North-Western Health Board has submitted proposals to me as to how orthodontic waiting lists might be significantly reduced and I will be responding to the board's proposals in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of residential, respite, day and other support services available to persons with autism over 18. These are provided within autism specific services and also through the generic intellectual disability services. As part of the overall development of services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability, both the level of service provision and the range of support services available have been enhanced in recent years and this will continue over the next few years.</P>
      <P>With reference to the level of co-ordination which exists between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, both Departments, together with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, have worked together to enhance the level of educational and health related support services available to children with special needs. In relation to children with autism, additional funding of approximately £5 million has been invested by my Department between 1998 and 2000 to expand the level of health related support services to this group. While the major proportion of the work undertaken by both Departments relates to children, where the Department of Education and Science is involved with vocational training services, there would also be liaison, where necessary, between the two Departments and the boards. The implications of the recent High Court judgment for both the educational and health related support services are currently being examined. In relation to the Department of Finance, my Department works closely with that Department, through the Estimates and budgetary processes, to progress the development of the overall health services, including services to persons with autism. My Department would also support proposals put forward by the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Finance which are related to children or adults with disabilities.</P>
      <P>While the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority are increasingly providing more comprehensive directories of services for persons with disabilities, I will discuss the Deputy's suggestion of a checklist or some other method of providing more comprehensive information on services to persons with autism with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board had 259 people on the waiting list for ENT procedures, including patients awaiting tonsil operations, at 30 June 2000, the latest date for which figures are available. I understand from the North-Eastern Health Board that ENT procedures for the Louth-Meath area are carried out by Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda with the average waiting time being three months for children and 12 months for adults. ENT procedures for the Cavan-Monaghan area are carried out in Omagh as part of North-South co-operation initiative, the average waiting time for procedures being 12 to 24 months. The scheduling of procedures is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the overall numbers on waiting lists as at 30 June 2000 fell by 5,004 which is a reduction of 13.58% on the end of the December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year, I announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable additional waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This brings the dedicated funding to waiting list procedures to £34 million this year.</P>
      <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer-term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

    <P>*Information from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and South-Eastern Health Board is not yet to hand. It will be forwarded to the Deputy when available.</P>
    <P>The number of inspections carried out include first, second and third annual inspections as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Article 32 (1) of the regulations requires health boards to furnish a report in writing to the person carrying on the pre-school service of the outcome of an inspection, following an inspection by an authorities person. I understand from the health boards that where appropriate they confirm to pre-school providers &ndash; either by letter or as part of the inspection report &ndash; that their facility was found to be in compliance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>All deficiencies identified during an inspection are detailed in the inspection report and forwarded to the pre-school provider. The provider is given a timefame to reply to the report, outlining what measures are to be put in place to deal with the deficiencies. The health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. If the deficiencies, noted during inspection, are of a serious nature and the team feel that there is a potential risk to the safety of the children, the provider is so informed and a follow-up inspection will be carried out within a shorter period of time to ensure compliance with the recommendations of the inspection team.</P>
    <P>The type of deficiencies found during inspections include: a requirement to reduce places mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and-or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times; inadequately equipped first aid box &ndash; a list of suggested contents is forwarded to the provider, where necessary; incomplete record keeping in respect of the register of children, details of staff, fire safety and maintenance records etc; inadequate sanitary accommodation for adults and children-water not thermostatically controlled; inadequate storage of toxic materials; inadequate rest and outdoor play facilities; inadequate fire safety equipment; and a <Col N="1194" /> second adult not being present on the premises in sessional services.</P>
    <P>Health boards offer an advice and support service to pre-school providers who are proposing to commence a new pre-school service, in order to outline to them the requirement for a pre-school service.</P>
    <P>In addition, health boards have indicated that they provide information and advice in relation to accessing funding and-or other supports which may be useful to providers in addressing the recommendations of the inspection report. The boards have also indicated that on their second and third annual inspections pre-school providers are complying with the majority of the requirements of the regulations.</P>

    <P>The study &ldquo;Women and Crisis Pregnancy&rdquo;, commissioned by my Department from the Department of Sociology, Trinity College, Dublin and published in 1998, included among the women interviewed a number of pregnant teenagers. This study contained conclusions rather than recommendations and did not address teenage pregnancy as a separate issue. Nonetheless, its findings in relation to such issues as access to family planning and pregnancy counselling services and the need for education to encourage more responsible behaviour by those in sexual relationships have helped to inform the development of policy in these areas.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with a number of agencies, my Department is currently implementing a pilot initiative on teenage parenting support as part of the national child care investment strategy. These projects, located in Dublin, Galway and Limerick, will identify and develop models of good practice <Col N="1224" /> in the planning of services for young parents, particularly those deemed to be at risk. The objectives include increasing access to services, increasing the support services available to teenage parents, improving the safety and well-being of children and improving family functioning. The teenage parenting support initiative will be evaluated in order to assess its impact and to identify key themes and issues.</P>
    <P>In 1997-8 the Eastern Health Board, now the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ran a teenage health initiative as a primary preventative programme aimed at teenagers at risk of pregnancy. Its objectives were to educate young people in a positive way and to bring about changes in attitudes and behaviour in relation to their personal development and sexual activity. Training was offered to youth organisations, youth projects and resource centres dealing with young people. Evaluation showed that the programme had been effective and it is planned to develop the initiative in the future.</P>
    <P>At national level, this year an additional £1.6 million has been provided to health boards for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. Health boards have been asked to concentrate service developments on measures aimed at reducing unwanted pregnancies in the 15-34 age group and among the initiatives being undertaken are the funding of additional GP family planning clinics; the recruitment of additional personnel to work in the area of teenage pregnancy and support for single parents; and increased grant aid to voluntary organisations providing family planning or pregnancy counselling services.</P>
    <P>Work is under way at the moment on the planning of a public education and information campaign, to be launched later in the year, which will be aimed at those aged 18 and upwards. This will seek to encourage responsibility in attitudes to relationships and sexual health and to inform and educate people about the range of issues involved. Among the issues to be addressed are the promotion of responsible behaviour among those who are sexually active; education about how pregnancy occurs, the effective use of contraception and prevention of sexually-transmitted infection; cultivation of more responsible atti<Col N="1225" /> tudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity; and increased awareness of reproductive health and pregnancy counselling services.</P>

      <P>Data on births are published in the annual and quarterly reports on vital statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office. The most recent figures available refer to the first quarter of 2000. The number of births in Ireland to mothers aged under 23 years is set out in the following table for 1980 to 2000. Data by health board, county and marital status of mother are being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy in the near future. Further information on family and socio-economic circumstances is not routinely available.</P>
      <P>The ESRI has responsibility for the perinatal reporting system which collects additional data on occupation and maternal characteristics. It is at present analysing data for the period 1994 to 1999.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to ensure that a haemovigilance programme is in place in each of the public hospitals in order to minimise the potential risk to patients and staff by the implementation of best practice in the management of blood and blood products.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the tribunal of inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board chaired by Mr. Justice Finlay recommended the establishment of a procedure for the reporting of abnormal reactions to blood and blood products. The report also indicated that health professionals have a clear professional duty to report such adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>Following detailed consultations between the Irish Medicines Board, the Blood Transfusion Service Board, now the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board, and my Department, procedures for the reporting of abnormal reactions to blood or blood components have been now put in place. The procedures mirror those that already apply in the case of abnormal reactions to medicinal products.</P>
      <P>A national haemovigilance office has been established within the IBTS. The main functions of the office are to receive, collate and follow up reports from hospitals and general practitioners of adverse reactions to blood components. The Establishment Order of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service was amended by S.I. 22 of 2000 to provide a statutory basis for the office and also to require it to furnish reports of adverse reactions to blood components to the IMB. The office provides dedicated training and advice to hospitals and health professionals throughout the country and is led by a consultant haematologist.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the establishment of the national haemoviligance office, my Department in March 1999 requested hospitals to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that abnormal reactions to blood components are reported. To ensure that hospitals were in a position to achieve this important objective, my Department provided dedicated resources to hospitals to develop and strengthen transfusion medicine, including their haemovigilance support service. Hospitals which did not already have multi-disciplinary transfusion committees were requested by my Department to establish such committees, and hospitals were also requested to review all aspects of transfusion practice. In 1999 £1.35 million was made available to hospitals to improve transfusion practice and to support the implementation of the national haemovigilance programme. A further £1.6 million has been made available this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year will see the first full year of operation of the newly established reporting system. To ensure the effective implementation of the haemovigilance programme, my Department in conjunction with the IMB and the IBTS will review the operation of the current system at that stage and determine what further measures <Col N="1231" /> including legislative are necessary to improve this system.</P>

      <P>The report entitled &ldquo;Ageing with Confidence&rdquo; was adopted by the Southern Health Board in June 2000 and outlines proposals for the provision of services for older people from 2000 to 2010 in the board's area. The development of specialist departments of medicine for older people in acute hospitals is one of the recommendations of the plan. There are currently 29 specialist departments of medicine for older people nationally, including units at Cork University Hospital and Tralee General Hospital. My Department has approved the planning of a further four departments at the Mercy Hospital Cork, South Infirmary-Royal Victoria Hospital Cork, Bantry General Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, funding of approximately £208 million has been made available to the health boards to enhance services for older people. It is anticipated that this funding will lead to an improvement in specialist led services by increasing the number of assessment of rehabilitation units and day hospitals. This will ensure more focused treatment under the direction of consultant physicians in old age medicine, thus significantly reducing length of stay in hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>No submission has been received in my Department from Cork University Hospital concerning the extension of the national breast screening programme. However, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Deputy of progress to <Col N="1233" /> date with regard to the implementation and future plans of the programme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997 the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the eastern, north eastern and midland health board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
      <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; on-going evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
      <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting Phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that Phase II of the programme should follow Phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. At my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the National Cancer Forum. I have received this report and it is currently under consideration.</P>

Under the national development plan, the level of investment in information and communications technology, ICT, has been significantly increased and health agencies have been requested to ensure that a high priority is given to enabling services to be delivered at the most appropriate location, supported by relevant ICT initiatives, such as tele-medicine applications. A number of telecommunications projects, including tele-medicine projects, have already been successfully piloted. My Department, in conjunction with health agencies, is currently working on the development of an overall e-health strategy which is expected to include provision for the development of a range of tele-medicine and related projects.</P>

In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department is supporting a range of important initiatives across the health sector which focus on quality improvement. Examples of these national initiatives include the introduction of a hospital accreditation programme, governance and management development, risk management, clinicians in management, clinical audit, patient advocacy and the development of hospital performance indicators. My Department does not routinely collect quality improvement reports in respect of individual hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, pointing out the breach of a number of medicinal products regulations, has contacted the magazine which has been instructed to cease this particular advertisement and any other such advertisement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 311 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of drug treatment services in the eastern region is the statutory responsibility of the eastern regional health authority and the three area health boards. The authority has raised the matter with the methadone treatment list based at Trinity Court, Pearse Street, and I am advised that 144 pharmacies are participating in the methadone protocol in the Dublin region with a total of 160 pharmacies in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>There are 216 pharmacies participating in the methadone protocol nationwide. In areas outside Dublin pharmacies participate in the programme as the need arises. In the eastern region, the three area health boards are working to involve as many pharmacies in the protocol as possible. Three liaison pharmacists have been appointed who, as part of their job description are actively involved in this process. Further patients could be referred from central services if more general practitioners and pharmacists became involved in treatment of drug misusers in their own local areas. I would therefore encourage more pharmacies to become involved to ensure that the numbers receiving treatment in the community is spread among a large number of pharmacies.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to a breakdown of pharmacies by postal district is currently being collated and will be forwarded to him in a few days.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310, 312 and 313 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A payment structure and appropriate fees for pharmacists involved in dispensing methadone was agreed between my officials and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union at the commencement of the methadone protocol scheme in 1998, following the introduction of the methadone (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998. I am satisfied that <Col N="1237" /> this payment is fair and in keeping with other health board schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition, pharmacists are provided with support and advice through a liaison pharmacist based in each area health board in the area of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and through regional drugs co-ordinators in other health boards. The liaison pharmacists communicate also with other pharmacists who are not providing services at present in order to encourage them to become involved. The methadone protocol scheme also has the full support of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that since the introduction of the scheme in 1988 the number of pharmacies participating has increased significantly and now stands at 160 for the eastern regional health authority administrative area. More drug users could be treated if there were more pharmacists involved in the protocol. It is important to have as many pharmacists as possible involved in order to spread the availability of services, particularly in terms of the number of locations available.</P>
    <P>Of course my Department is always anxious to explore ways of encouraging more pharmacists to participate and if the Deputy has any suggestions to make in this regard I will gladly arrange to have them considered.</P>

      <P>The operation of the methadone protocol is contingent on support from general practitioners and pharmacists living in the locality of drug misusers. On publication of the protocol, it was circulated to a wide range of agencies including An Garda Síochána and voluntary and community groups. Support of all agencies involved in drug demand reduction is an essential element in the success of the protocol.</P>
      <P>My Department has regular contact with the national drugs strategy team and the local drugs task forces which has representation from the gardaí and other agencies.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.</P>
      <P>The nature of the business being conducted in pharmacies, in dealing with a wide range of controlled drugs, makes it essential that all pharmacies would make provision for security, regardless of the specific drugs concerned. All pharmacies, therefore, should already have good security systems in place. The grant, referred to by the Deputy, is intended to help pharmacists in the provision of additional security facilities where these are required.</P>
      <P>During 1999 a capital grant of up to £2,000 was made available to pharmacies involved in the methadone protocol to allow them to cater for supervised dispensing of methadone in their premises. The grant covered such items as minor structural alterations but could also cover additional security equipment or a larger drug safe. Each grant application was assessed by a liaison pharmacist employed by the health board in consultation with health board officials. The availability of the grant was publicised throughout the health boards. It was also publicised by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union in its general memorandum to members in January 1999 and again in May 2000. Earlier this year the grant was increased to £5,000 and pharmacies in the greater Dublin area have been informed of this through the liaison pharmacists.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current grant of £5,000 is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has circulated a briefing paper on proposing reforms to the existing arrangements for medical indemnity cover for doctors working in the public health service. One of the objectives of the enterprise liability proposal is to bring a greater degree of financial stability to the provision of indemnity cover. The steep and rapid escalation in the cost of claims arising from infants who suffer cerebral injury at birth has caused problems for all of the insurance and indemnity bodies providing cover to doctors and hospitals. Making the change from the current fragmented arrangements to a system based on enterprise liability is a complex process which will raise many difficult questions. The objective of the exercise is to ensure that the interests of patients who have legitimate claims, and doctors on whose behalf these claims must be settled, are protected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 and 362 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I received the report of the National Cancer Forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. I have considered this report and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, as I feel some further refinement is needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level I established an advisory group to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast disease services. This advisory group is chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, Professor of Surgery and Consultant Surgeon, St. Vincent's Hospital. The membership of the group consists of Dr. Bernadette O'Keefe, deputy chief medical officer, Department of Health and Children, Dr. Ann O'Doherty, consultant radiologist, <Col N="1242" /> national breast screening programme and Ms Catherine Bannon, higher executive officer, Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The advisory group met with Western Health Board officials and clinicians on 12 October 2000. The recommendations contained in the report were discussed, including the specific recommendations relating to the provision of breast disease services in the Western Health Board area. As the provision of health services in this area is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board in the first instance, following this meeting I understand that the board will formulate its proposals for the development of breast disease services and submit them to this Department for approval and funding.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> The need for further places for the young chronic sick &ndash; constant nursing care &ndash; is part of the overall picture in relation to pressures on acute hospital beds and also in relation to the service needs of people with severe physical disabilities.</P>
    <P>There are currently 93 long-term residential places and sic respite places available for the young chronic sick in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, in St. Mary's Hospital, Cherry Orchard Hospital and Peamont Hospital. A project team has recently been established by the ERHA to plan the provision of young chronic sick units in the ERHA region. It is proposed to provide one new unlit in each of the three area health boards and it is currently estimated that the units will take at least two years for completion. In the meantime, the ERHA will provide alternative placements in a number of private nursing homes for 15 young chronic sick and five individuals with brain injuries currently being cared for in the acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>The ERHA also provides funding under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, to the Ardeen, Barrett, Cara and Richmond Cheshire Homes. These homes currently provide 118 residential places and 12 respite places for people with physical disabilities.</P>
    <P>I have referred the Deputy's question on numbers awaiting admission and waiting times for admission to young chronic sick units to the ERHA for direct reply.</P>

      <P>The strategy being pursued by the health promotion unit of my Department in relation to breastfeeding is in accordance with the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. This policy has guided developments and initiatives in relation to the promotion of breastfeeding. While many recommendations have been implemented, it is acknowledged that the incidence of breastfeeding in this country continues to be lower than that of our European counterparts.</P>
      <P>However, the health promotion strategy published in July this year calls for a more structured approach to the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy. As part of this new strategy, it is proposed to appoint a national breastfeeding co-ordinator who will advise the health promotion unit on the effectiveness of current policy actions in Ireland and on measures required to increase breastfeeding rates. I will consider what new structures may be required in this context, including the reestablishment of a national committee on breastfeeding.</P>

      <P>The Delta Centre, Carlow, provides a range of services for people with disabilities. Foremost among these services are, day activity, rehabilitative training, residential services and a high support unit.</P>
      <P>The statutory body with responsibility for funding the Delta Centre is the South Eastern Health Board. The South Eastern Health Board provides an annual block allocation to the Delta Centre on the basis of net operating costs as evidenced by certified accounts. These accounts cover all income, including any income from other health boards for services provided. The board's allocation for any specific year is based on all net costs, including services provided to clients from other health board areas. Any increase in income from other health boards would have a diminishing impact on the net costs and on the allocation from the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>At present there is one person from the Mid Western Health Board availing of day activity services in Delta for whom the Mid Western Health Board is currently paying a capitation rate of £2,755 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Day activity services are being provided for six persons from the Midland Health Board. In addition to a capitation rate of £1,412 per annum, the Midland Health Board is paying a weekly tra<Col N="1248" /> vel allowance of £10.50 in respect of five of these persons. The sixth person has multiple disabilities giving rise to greater service needs and a rate of £8,000 per annum has been agreed between the Midland Health Board and Delta.</P>
    <P>On the basis of data received by me, there do not appear to be any clients from other health boards currently in the Delta Centre.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 341, 345, 346, 347 and 357 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tables.</P>
      <P>The data are derived from the hospital in-patient enquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system which covers all hospitalisations in publicly funded acute hospitals. This system records hospital episodes and is not a patient based database. Thus where a patient is admitted into hospital on more than one occasion these individual hospital episodes are recorded separately. For specific conditions it is not possible to use the HIPE database to ascertain the underlying cause of the illness or procedure. This is particularly true for conditions which have more than one cause or have a long-term effect.</P>
      <P>Table 1 contains all discharges recording self-poisoning. The table also identifies whether those discharges include a specific indication of paracetamol type poisoning. Poisonings from other similar analgesics, that is, acetanilid and phenacetin, cannot be excluded from this category but numbers are not likely to be significant. In addition the data are broken down by gender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position in relation to the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol, both in pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets, is based on the policy and recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board which are implemented by the board in the granting of product authorisations in respect of medicinal products to be placed or maintained on the market in this country. This board is the competent authority for the granting and renewal of product authorisations under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998. These authorisations set out the conditions subject to which medicinal products may be placed on the market. The primary aim is to promote public health by ensuring that medicinal products available to the Irish public meet the required standards of safety, quality and efficacy in accordance with the obligation arising from current EC and national legislative requirements.</P>
      <P>Due to concerns over the serious effects arising from overdosages of paracetamol, the Irish Medicines Board in 1997 drew up a series of recommendations in relation to the sale of paracetamol, including a recommendation to restrict the sale of paracetamol in non-pharmacy retail outlets to packs containing not more than 12 500mg tablets or equivalent. Following extensive consultation, almost all of the manufacturers concerned have supported the recommendations and have agreed to conform with the board's recommendations with a view to implementing them in order to enhance public safety.</P>
      <P>Regulations to restrict the availability of paracetamol, which would give statutory effect to the recommendations made by the Irish Medicines Board, are currently under consideration in my Department. These recommendations relate to pack size and availability in both pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets and will, as already outlined, subject packs of paracetamol above particular pack sizes to pharmacy-only or prescription-only control as appropriate. I understand that most manufacturers are already operating within these guidelines in anticipation of the introduction of the new regulations.</P>

      <P>The United Kingdom authorities, in respect of Britain and Northern Ireland, introduced restrictions on the sale of paracetamol products by means of statutory instruments which took effect from the 16 September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations concerned required the introduction of (a) additional warnings for all paracet<Col N="1254" /> amol containing products, as follows: (i) on the labels &ndash;&ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even if you feel well&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do not take with any other paracetamol-containing products&rdquo;; (ii) where there is a patient information leaflet, the following expanded version of the first warning statement above is required to be included in the leaflet: &ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even if you feel well, because of the risk of delayed, serious liver damage&rdquo;; (iii) where there is no patient information leaflet, the full version of the warning statement as in (ii) must be included on the label; and (b) reduction of paracetamol and aspirin pack sizes by: (i) limiting the pack-sizes in non-pharmacy outlets to not more than 16 non-effervescent tablets or capsules; (ii) limiting the pack-sizes in pharmacy outlets to not more than 32 non-effervescent tablets or capsules; (iii) larger pack sizes are to be available on prescription, with some discretion remaining available to pharmacists for those who have regular or long-term requirements.</P>

      <P>My Department will continue to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services. It must be acknowledged that major progress has been made since the launch in 1997 of the action plan for the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy. Since then, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to each health board for the development of these services. Among developments in the cancer services have been additional consultant appointments approved in the specialties of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care. Phase one of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, has commenced as has the cervical screening programme. In this context, I will keep the question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer under review, having regard to the most up to date advice on the medical effectiveness of the available screening techniques. The national cancer forum, which advises me on all aspects of cancer services, will continue to have an important role in this regard and I will be asking the forum to ensure that all relevant research is taken into account in arriving at a conclusion on the introduction of new screening programmes and techniques.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients was introduced in August 1992. It provides guidelines for good stan<Col N="1256" /> dards of practice in acute hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis, its objective is to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of the individual patient and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>On the specific issues of the scheduling of appointments, section 2 of the charter states that:</P>
      <P>You have the right, when your family doctor refers you to hospital for an out-patient appointment, to:</P>
      <P>receive confirmation within a reasonable time of the date of your first appointment;</P>
      <P>be given an individual appointment time;</P>
      <P>be seen by a consultant or senior doctor on your first appointment.</P>
      <P>You have the right, should your appointment at an out-patient department be cancelled by the hospital, to receive adequate and timely notice of such cancellation and to be given a new appointment on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>A previous response to the Deputy indicated that 11 acute hospitals had not fully implemented the patient's charter guidelines regarding out-patient appointments due to logistical and other factors. I now understand that almost all of the hospitals concerned are allocating individual out-patient appointments whilst the remainder, St. Michael's Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, and Mayo General Hospital, are currently putting in place structures with a view to meeting in full the provisions of the charter.</P>
      <P>The patients' charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients' rights and I intend to develop a comprehensive policy which will build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the provision of booster immunisations are a matter for the individual health boards in the first instance. My Department has made inquiries of the Western Health Board about the matter raised by the Deputy and has been informed that a local immunisation <Col N="1259" /> committee has recently been established to consider a number of issues, including the arrangements for the delivery of booster immunisations. The board has indicated that difficulty with the recruitment of area medical officer personnel is one of the constraints on the development of this service at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of dental treatment to children in County Mayo is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I have had inquiries made of the board who inform me that the current situation with regard to dental services in the Erris/Belmullet area, which is included in the scheme, is as follows; there are 19 schools in the area with a total of 1,201 pupils. Children in 2nd, 4th and 6th classes are screened for dental treatment and receive treatment as necessary. All children receive emergency treatment for relief of pain or trauma.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of schools, nine are under the care of a private dental practitioner who provides services on behalf of the health board. The other ten schools are in the care of two health board dentists. One of these dentists is a full time officer of the board and travels to Belmullet one day a week and the other works the equivalent of one day a week on a sessional basis. All children are screened for orthodontic treatment need in 6th class by the regional orthodontic department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has difficulty in recruiting dentists to work in geographically disadvantaged areas but proposes to base a dental officer on a permanent basis in the area as soon as circumstances permit. The board is anxious to extend routine treatment <Col N="1260" /> services to children in the area up to 16 years of age as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August last. The Act is due to be commenced in stages with the first provisions, including Part V on Housing Supply, scheduled to be brought into force in November. It is intended to bring the rest of the Act into force early in 2001.</P>
      <P>Following commencement of Part V, each local authority will have to develop a housing strategy and incorporate these into their development plans. Guidelines for local authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies are currently in drafting for publication in November along with a model housing strategy. Planning authorities will have a maximum of nine months from commencement to prepare their housing strategy and start the procedures to vary their development plans. The strategies must be incorporated into the plans within a maximum of three further months. I will be urging the local authorities to complete the process well ahead of these time limits so that they can operate the social and affordable housing provisions as soon as possible. The agreement on the transfer of land to a local authority will be a condition of the granting of planning permission. A series of regional seminars for local authorities on the implementation of Part V is planned to follow the publication of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Guidelines and explanatory notes on the Act and regulations will issue to all planning authorities as each stage is commenced. It is intended to hold a series of training seminars in the new year to assist local authorities in the implementation of other parts of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Governemnt (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;dead weight&rdquo;, that is, development likely to proceed without the benefit of tax incentives, was identified in the Irish context in the KPMG-led study of urban renewal schemes published in 1996. The application of tax incentives to selected development represents income foregone to the Exchequer and, therefore, should only be used in circumstances where the use is justified in terms of greatest need and has the potential to assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development. The guidelines covering urban and town renewal schemes adopted since the study have specified that, in the preparation of integrated area plans and town renewal plans and the subsequent selection of sites within the plans, care must be taken to avoid selection of sites which could constitute dead weight.</P>
      <P>The primary criterion used to assess whether dead weight may be relevant in regard to a specific proposal is whether the incentive is required to overcome identifiable, substantive barriers to development. In the preparation of the town renewal plans by county councils and the assessment of these by the expert panel, the application of the term &ldquo;dead weight&rdquo; would have been considered in those situations where there was no identifiable barrier to development and where the location and character of a site suggested that development was feasible without the aid of incentives.</P>

It was not, however, assigned a high priority by the council. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced in July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time. It would, however, be open to the council to consider advancing the scheme under the devolved small schemes programme.</P>

      <P>The framework for the national car test &ndash; NCT &ndash; which was decided by the previous Government and continued by this Government, involves its operation on a public-private partnership and self-financing basis. The NCT is required under EU legislation to provide for virtually universal coverage of private vehicles; accordingly only minimal exemptions have been granted from its scope.</P>
      <P>The contract for the NCT has been awarded on a competitive basis so as to ensure a high level of service and value for money to its users. The two-yearly test, which costs £35, provides a high quality diagnostic service using computerised testing equipment. The retest fee has been fixed at £19.80 where use of test equipment is necessary; otherwise, retests will be carried out free of charge.</P>
      <P>Private motoring costs have not in the past received public subsidies, apart from the reliefs of VAT-VRT, motor tax and fuel tax afforded for the benefit of persons with disabilities.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, 28 local authorities have formally adopted waste management plans under the Waste Management Act, 1996. They are Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin, Tipperary (North Riding), Tipperary (South Riding), Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow and Waterford County Councils; and Dublin, Limerick and Waterford Corporations. Meaningful and comprehensive planning are a key prerequisite to improved waste management performance and, accordingly, considerable effort has been devoted at national, regional and local level to delivering effective results in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligation to make waste management plans was imposed on local authorities under Part <Col N="1270" /> II of the 1996 Act, and the subsequent Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997, specified the nature and scope of certain matters to be addressed in such plans.</P>
    <P>From the outset, local authorities were encouraged to adopt a regional approach to the planning process, with a view to the more efficient and cost-effective provision of services and infrastructure. This approach was reinforced in the October 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways. Grant assistance of over £1.1 million was provided for local authorities under the EU funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-1999, in respect of nine waste management strategy studies carried out by or on behalf of local authorities, for the purposes of informing the preparation of the proposed local and regional plans.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the planning process, which entails considerable public consultation, is to ensure comprehensive, high quality waste management plans which will fully address the complex issues arising in relation to the prevention, minimisation and recovery of wastes, and which provide for the environmentally sound disposal of residual wastes. Accordingly, it was important that adequate time be allowed for the completion of this process.</P>
    <P>However, the planning process has proved to be lengthy and, in light of current EU legal proceedings against Ireland, it is imperative that it be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Increased costs of oil based products are a reality of present international market conditions. Within the overall limits of the local government budgetary process, I intend that regard should be had to this factor <Col N="1271" /> in determining the allocation for non-national roads.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, that road construction cost increases should also act as a stimulus for the development by local authorities of effective counter measures, which may involve use of alternative construction methods or other initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398, 404 and 405 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are available to people aged 66 or over, people with disabilities and carers who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone, or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition. In addition, widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement, to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin in April this year, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance for those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes examined the many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups, including widows and widowers, using the above objectives as the criteria for decision. In this regard, it was noted that widow-widowers under 66 years may experience social exclusion but they are not groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of extending the free schemes to widows under 66 years with dependent children would be in the region of £5 million annually. However, it must be noted that such an extension would increase demands to extend the schemes to other groups with similar income needs, such as lone parents and the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The review considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability. The review noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes. Overall the proposals in the review are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Free travel is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to people with disabilities under 66 years who are in receipt of long-term disability type payments from this Department, for example, invalidity pension, blind person's pension and disability <Col N="1276" /> allowance. The scheme is not available to people in receipt of short-term payments, such as disability benefit. This matter was examined in the review of the free schemes and it was considered that the free schemes should not be extended to recipients of payments that are short term in nature.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Christmas bonus, this has been paid at a rate equivalent to 70% of a person's normal weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of £20 since 1989. This year, the bonus has been increased to 100% or double the person's normal weekly payment. This measure is estimated to cost £66 million.</P>
    <P>Payment will be made in early December to 716,000 social welfare recipients in receipt of long-term payments, including: disablement pension; death benefit by way of pension; old age contributory and non-contributory pensions; retirement pension; invalidity pension; widow/ers contributory and non-contributory pensions; orphan's contributory and non-contributorypensions; pre-retirement allowance; blind pension; carer's allowance; one parent family payment; payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit-allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance; unemployment assistance at the long-term rate; and disability allowance.</P>
    <P>The bonus is paid to those who are sick or disabled and in receipt of invalidity pension or disability allowance. It is not payable to people in receipt of short-term payments such as disability benefit or injury benefit.</P>
    <P>At present there are approximately 48,000 persons in receipt of disability benefit or injury benefit payments. It is estimated that the cost of extending the 100% Christmas bonus to this group would be an additional £4.4 million. As the Deputy is aware, such substantial expenditure would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support for carers on low incomes who look after people, including children, who need full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. There are currently 16,137 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
      <P>The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The effect of these changes means that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up £19,500 could still qualify for a minimum carer's allowance, and also receive an annual respite care grant and the free schemes.</P>
      <P>It has been previously estimated that increasing the means disregards to £125 for a single person and £250 for a couple would increase the payment of approximately 2,200 existing carers at a cost of approximately £3.5 million. It is very difficult to estimate the number of additional carers who would qualify as income data are not available. However, additional costs in the region of £15 million would be incurred if an estimated additional 3,000 carers qualified leading to a total increase of £18.5 million approximately in overall expenditure.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of abolishing the means test and extending carer's allowance at existing levels to all full-time carers would be in the region of £179 million annually. If one were to cost this proposal using the number of carers estimated by the care groups, this figure would rise to £547 million annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those who are most in need. There are a wide range of services required, including community care and respite care, to support carers in their caring role. It is doubtful if a payment to all carers, regardless <Col N="1278" /> of their income, could be considered to be the best use of resources. However, the position in regard to the means test will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme administered by my Department covers the line and instrument rental and the equivalent of 20 call units in each two-monthly billing period. The scheme is expected to benefit some 190,000 people this year at an estimated cost of £33.2 million.</P>
      <P>Under present arrangements appropriate credits are applied directly to the relevant customer accounts with Eircom using a data transfer and database matching structure developed over the years by the Department.</P>
      <P>Beneficiaries under the free telephone rental allowance scheme who switch to other service providers continue to receive full credit in respect of line and instrument rental on their Eircom bills and are billed separately by their new supplier for call charges.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that beneficiaries under the scheme will be able to avail themselves of any benefits accruing from competition in the telecommunication service market. To this end, work is under way in my Department with a view to adapting the scheme structure and administration.</P>

      <P>Under the treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department, persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and their dependent spouses can avail of benefit in respect of a certain range of dental, optical and aural services subject to satisfying certain contri<Col N="1279" /> bution conditions. The insured persons covered for these benefits are those who pay PRSI contributions at class A, E, H or P. A dependent spouse may qualify for benefits on the basis of his-her spouse's PRSI insurance record.</P>
      <P>The extension of entitlement to dental benefit to the stay at home spouses along the lines proposed by the Deputy would lead to a demand for the extension of the benefit, in the first instance, to the insured persons not currently covered. It is tentatively estimated, based on the existing levels of take-up that the overall cost of such an extension would amount to almost £10 million per annum, of which over £1 million would relate to claims in respect of dependent spouses.</P>
      <P>Any changes in the coverage of dental benefit would have financial implications and is a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources. While I have no specific proposals, at present, for extending the coverage of the dental benefit or other services under the treatment benefit scheme the operation of the scheme is subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department.</P>

      <P>The annual cost of extending cover for disability benefit to the self-employed &ndash; class S PRSI contributors &ndash; would be in the region of £26 million. This costing assumes a level of take-up by the self-employed similar to that currently experienced in relation to insured workers. Disability benefit is currently available to certain employed contributors who are unfit for work due to illness. In addition, these contributors are also covered for invalidity pension which is a payment made to those permanently incapable of work. The self-employed are not covered for disability benefit or invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the National Pensions Board examined the question of extending cover for invalidity pension to the self-employed and, in its final report, 1993, recommended against extending such cover at that time. The board felt that cover for permanent incapacity for the self-employed would be best met through a means-tested invalidity allowance. The board's recommendation for the introduction of a means-tested invalidity allowance has since been met by the introduction of the disability allowance in October 1996. However, it also recommended that the question of introducing social insurance cover for invalidity pension for the self-employed <Col N="1280" /> should be reviewed not later than five years after the introduction of the proposed means-tested scheme, in the light of experience in its application.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to extend social insurance cover for disability benefit, or invalidity pension, to the self-employed. The self-employed and others who are not covered for disability benefit are eligible to apply for supplementary welfare allowance if they experience a need for an income maintenance payment during periods of illness. All persons who are suffering from an illness or infirmity which may reasonably be expected to last for a year or more and who do not qualify for invalidity pension are eligible to apply for disability allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is made to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April regardless of the temperature.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions of the scheme is that the person must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance schemes are different in nature to the free schemes and, therefore, qualification conditions differ significantly. In particular, the fuel allowance schemes are means-tested and are not age-related. The free schemes, on the other hand, are mainly payable to certain categories of recipients, such as pensioners, carers and people with disabilities to support care in the community.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were recently extended to all people aged 75 years or over regardless of income and household composition and carers in receipt of carer's allowance. It is quite possible, therefore, for a person to qualify for free schemes and not qualify for fuel allowance on grounds of means or household composition or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the importance of fuel allowances to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. However, the question of aligning the <Col N="1281" /> qualifying conditions for fuel allowances and free schemes has to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided for people with heating needs.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department discriminates against self-employed PRSI subscribers in refusing consideration of contributions paid in the 1999-2000 tax year for maternity benefit purposes in view of the fact that a current maternity benefit claim by an employed worker may be adjudicated on the basis of PRSI contributions paid in that tax year; if he will take immediate steps to correct this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to maternity benefit was extended to self-employed women with effect from April 1997 on broadly similar lines to that which applies in the case of employees. No changes in contribution conditions have been made since April 1997. As a result of those changes, there are certain differences in the qualifying conditions for entitlement as between employed and self-employed women and these differences reflect the different arrangements which apply to each group for the purposes of liability and payment of PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>Final tax and PRSI payments are not due to be paid by self-employed people for up to two years after the end of any particular income tax year. For instance, in the case of the income tax year ended 5 April 2000, final tax and PRSI returns can be forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners up until the end of January 2002, while final payment of any outstanding tax and PRSI liabilities can be made up until the end of April 2002.</P>
      <P>As PRSI contributions for self-employed people cannot be awarded until the full liability has been paid, it will be seen that it can take some time after the end of a particular tax year before a self-employed person's PRSI contribution record for that year can be finalised.</P>
      <P>The end of year tax and PRSI returns for employed women are due to be forwarded by employers to the Revenue Commissioners within 45 days of the end of the tax year, that is, by late May 2000 in the case of the 1999-2000 tax year. Therefore, the contribution conditions for maternity benefit which apply to employed women and which allow for recent PRSI contributions to be taken into account towards qualifying for benefit are not appropriate in the case of self-employed women. However, in recognition of the different PRSI arrangements applying to self-employed women, contributions paid in an earlier income tax year, currently the 1997-98 tax year, can be taken into account.</P>

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in County Mayo is entitled to arrears of benefit from the date he was disallowed unemployment assistance on 9 December 1992 to the date of payment of a carer's allowance in January 2000 in view of the fact that his circumstances did not change in that period and particularly as he appealed his unemployment assistance disallowance decision but heard nothing on it.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from July 1992 to 9 December 1992 when his claim was disallowed on the grounds that he was not available for and-or genuinely seeking work. He <Col N="1283" /> appealed the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>On 8 April 1993 an appeals officer upheld this decision and a letter informing the person concerned of this decision was issued to him by the appeals office. An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 6 January 2000 in respect of his father and his claim was subsequently awarded from 6 January 2000 at the maximum weekly rate payable.</P>
      <P>It has been decided to backdate the date of award of carer's allowance to 6 July 1999, that is, six months prior to the date of application as the conditions for carer's allowance appear to be satisfied for this six month period. Arrears of allowance will issue shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to possible further backdating the case is now being referred to an investigator of my Department for further examination. On receipt of the investigator's report, the matter will be further considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's commitment to establish a national folklife museum in Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo, 13 new posts were approved. These posts are in addition to the five posts that currently exist in the folklife division of the National Museum. The 13 new posts are as follows: one keeper-manager; one curator at assistant keeper grade II level; one technical assistant, conservation; one executive officer; nine support staff.</P>
      <P>The keeper-manager was recruited through a confined competition which was run by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission and the appointment was made on 1 June 1999. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently holding a competition to recruit the curator. It is intended to fill the technical assistant position from an existing Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission panel. The recruitment of the executive officer will be carried out in the normal manner by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The nine support staff will be recruited through open public competition by my Department prior to the opening of the facility to the public in the summer of 2001.</P>
      <P>I should also mention for the information of the Deputy that proposals for the creation of five additional posts are currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 419 and 420 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has no specific policy on the siting of telecommunications masts in the vicinity of archaeological sites provided such developments do not have a negative impact on the site in question.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development referred to by the Deputy, the position is that there is an embanked enclosure which has been formally recorded as a national monument, in the same field as this development. As a recorded monument, this enclosure is legally protected under the National Monuments (Amendment) Acts, 1930 to 1994. Preliminary development work at this site, which involved the installation of an access road, did not in any way encroach on the physical remains of the monument.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council has granted planning permission for the development which takes into account the recommendations made by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. Rather than having a specific policy relating to telecommunications masts each case is examined on its merits to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the heritage.</P>

Is mar gheall go háirithe ar an soláthar airgead breise a d'éirigh le mo Roinn a fháil i mbliana &ndash; agus atá ar fáil do mo Roinn ar feadh tréimhse an Plean Forbartha Náisiúnta Forbartha &ndash; chun Bóithre Stráitéiseacha sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú, a shocraigh mé na cruinnithe seo a bheith agam chomh luath seo.

      <P>Policy in the law would seem to cater for the various circumstances in which a person may not be able to give three months notice of marriage.</P>
      <P>The Family Law Act, 1995, provides a simple procedure under which the court may on application to it by both parties exempt the intended marriage from the three months notice requirements in that Act. The court order is granted where it is justified by serious reasons and in the interests of the parties concerned. However, there is no provision in the law for retrospective validation of the marriage where the notice requirement has not been complied with. While there are no proposals for change in relation to this particular provision, family law is kept under review, generally, in my Department.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Drimnagh area is policed from the Sundrive Road Garda station on a 24 hour basis. There are regular routine uniform and plain clothes patrols, which are also supported by a very active drugs unit which concentrates on Drimnagh and its environs. In addition to these patrols, a special patrol is in operation at weekends to deal specifically with public order offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed that there are also full-time community gardaí who, among other things, <Col N="1299" /> operate in the Drimnagh area and liaise with the co-ordinators of neighbourhood watch schemes in the area. I understand that they have regular meetings to discuss areas of complaint and progress made in dealing with complaints. Community gardaí operate a call-back system to advise victims of burglaries and such crimes in relation to their personal and home security, and reassurance of Garda support. The juvenile liaison officer for the area deals with juveniles who come to the attention of the Garda. Community gardaí also visit local schools, and give talks on crime, vandalism and road safety.</P>
    <P>In relation to underage drinking, the Garda authorities expect that the new Dublin Corporation by-laws will assist in combating underage drinking in parks, laneways and streets, which are sources of complaint from the public. I am informed that representations from public representatives about complaints are dealt with expeditiously. Generally, in these cases I understand that complainants are visited by the Garda, and are updated on progress of the investigation.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Drimnagh area is given comprehensive Garda attention and that the level of policing is continually under review to ensure optimum use of resources to counteract public order and anti-social behaviour which may arise from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The directorate for asylum support services was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department with responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. Due to the acute shortage of accommodation in Dublin, the Government decided that newly arrived asylum seekers should be dispersed throughout the country. Prior to this, most asylum seekers had been accommodated in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Following inspection of the premises at Great Western House, Frenchville Lane, Eyre Square, Galway city by the directorate, it was found to be suitable for the accommodation of asylum seekers and a contract was entered into with the proprietor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation centre is a hostel which has Bord Fáilte approval to accommodate 280 guests per night. The directorate has contracted for the full use of the hostel to accommodate 207 asylum seekers &ndash; 75% of the centre's capacity &ndash; on a phased basis and commenced accommodating asylum seekers there in September. The current occupancy is 135. The directorate has asked management at the centre to maintain liaison <Col N="1304" /> with the local environmental health services in relation to the bedroom plan for the centre so as to ensure that any regulatory requirements in this regard are met.</P>
    <P>The centre provides TVs in bedrooms where possible. There is a dedicated television room and a games room. There is also a self-catering kitchen and dining room with TV which acts as a further communal facility.</P>
    <P>The capacity for seating in the restaurant area during meal times is 60 persons and an additional 40 persons can be seated in an additional dining room. Management at the centre is satisfied that the seating provided is adequate to cater for the numbers to be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The premises is located in the city centre with access to a full range of services. In common with the practice in place in relation to all accommodation centres contracted for use by the directorate, the operation of this centre is monitored, by reference to a number of issues, on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>Where possible, prisoners are accommodated at locations most convenient to their homes. Naturally there are limitations to the extent to which this can be achieved. Some prisoners may not be suitable for a particular institution because of their age, security status or suitability to the regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most institutions run at full capacity with the result that there are limited opportunities for transfers. In that event transfers generally take place on a &ldquo;swap&rdquo; basis. This can mean that <Col N="1305" /> although a transfer is approved there can be delays before it is effected.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was committed to St. Patrick's Institution on 24 May 2000 and was transferred to Fort Mitchel on 16 August 2000 for operational reasons. Transfers for operational purposes may be necessary for a variety of reasons, including the need to protect a prisoner from other prisoners, to prevent planned disruption, to separate groups of prisoners who are in conflict, or simply to reallocate cell space to another prisoner or group of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has applied for a transfer to either Loughan House or Castlerea Prison. While I have given this case every consideration, I am not prepared to authorise his transfer to Loughan House at this stage of his sentence.</P>
    <P>I have, however, authorised a transfer to Castlerea Prison and he has been placed on a waiting list. The population in Castlerea is very static with few vacancies. It may therefore be some time before this move takes place. I understand that the person concerned is currently number seven on a waiting list of nine to transfer from Fort Mitchel to Castlerea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 453, 455 and 456 together.</P>
      <P>In September 1999 my Department established the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS. The aim of this service is to assist all students to develop to their potential and to maximise the benefit of their educational and other experiences. This service has a particular focus on students with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>In pursuing its objectives, NEPS is co-operating with the clinical services of the health boards. It is also developing a training module for teachers to assist in the screening of children from infant classes. In addition, NEPS, in co-operation with the National Disability Authority, is continuing to provide a psychological service for children with sensory and physical disabilities. An important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are in need of an early appointment. In many cases, the psychologist discusses individual students in the light of the student's assessment results with teachers and parents and advises on appropriate remedial strategies. This means that some students can benefit from the psychologist's advice without the need for an individual psychological assessment.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service, which is in the process of being developed on a nationwide basis, currently provides an assessment service for all second level schools and a limited number of primary schools. I am currently doubling the service by appointing an extra 50 psychologists.</P>
      <P>In areas where the national educational psychological service is available, teachers and parents who have concerns regarding particular children should report these concerns to the school's dedicated psychologist for attention. Where a NEPS service is not yet in place, the teacher or parent should refer the matter to the relevant director of community care.</P>
      <P>A range of responses is available to meet the professionally assessed needs of children with dyslexia. In some cases the level of need can be such as to be capable of being met by the remedial teacher service. This service is now in place in every primary school in the country with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. In other cases, children with dyslexia may require the assistance of the resource teacher service which supports children with special needs in integrated settings. More than 430 resource teachers are now deployed in the primary system to assist such children. Where the level of need is of a more serious nature, provision is made for children with dyslexia in four special schools and 19 special classes throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> I recently established a special task force on dyslexia to review the adequacy of the current range of educational provision and support services available for children with dyslexia and to make such recommendations as are considered necessary to ensure the delivery of an effective and efficient education service to children with dyslexia in the future. The task force, which is comprised of experts in the field of dyslexia, has already commenced its work and I have asked that it report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to consider, in collaboration with the relevant health authorities, how the problem of costs incurred by parents in securing private assessments where no service is provided by the State might be alleviated.</P>

All 26 students were assessed by NEPS personnel as soon as possible after the referral was made.</P>

      <P>My Department is in the process of implementing the Education Act, 1998. At present 51 of the 59 sections have been commenced. The Act provides that all sections must be commenced by 22 December. It is my intention that the remaining sections will be formally commenced before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 was passed into law on 5 July of this year. Initial planning <Col N="1309" /> for commencement, including consultation with the education partners, is now under way with a view to having the Act commenced in full well in advance of the two year period provided for in the Act itself. As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board. My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Government Departments. I will be in a position to establish the designate board once all of these have been received.</P>
    <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, was enacted on 13 July 1999. Much of the pre-commencement planning for this Act is now completed and I have recently indicated that I intend to bring the Act into operation in January 2001.</P>

      <P>Many of our young people today study a modern continental European language up to leaving certificate level. I am aware of the relatively low number of leaving certificate students learning Spanish. Spanish is now spoken by some 400 million people worldwide. Recently I have taken some important steps to increase the uptake of Spanish in our schools.</P>
      <P>A £4.5 million second level languages initiative has just got under way with the appointment of a national co-ordinator. This initiative seeks to build up our national language capacity in the areas of Spanish, Italian and Japanese. My Department has issued a circular to all second level schools inviting them to participate in the initiative. Some 98 schools have already declared an interest in introducing Spanish or in increasing their current provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative will help to fund in-service training for teachers of the languages concerned, to provide grants for the purchase of materials and to address the problems of teacher supply. My Department is about to place an advertisement in the national press to invite teachers who are qualified in one or more of the three languages <Col N="1312" /> concerned but have no opportunity to teach them at present to participate in the initiative. One way in which their talents may be used is in the creation of a team or teams of visiting teachers.</P>
    <P>There are at present 55 primary schools offering Spanish as part of our pilot project for modern languages. Great enthusiasm for learning the language is shown by participating teachers and pupils. The second level languages initiative will help to address the current problem of continuity of the study of Spanish up to leaving certificate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 to 466, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I will be pleased to meet the group concerned at a mutually convenient time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed in principle to the setting up of a body which will provide compensation for victims of abuse in childhood. This decision was taken as part of ongoing initiatives which arose from the horrifying accounts in recent years of abuse of children in reformatory and industrial schools and other residential institutions. The decision relates to people who, as children, were in the residential care of institutions in respect of which the State had significant, and in most cases statutory, regulatory and supervisory functions. In such cases the children concerned were separated from their parents and therefore did not have any opportunity to enjoy the care and protection which children in the care of their parents enjoy. For that reason they relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them. The decision to establish a compensation body therefore was to find ways in which people, who as children were abused in State care, can now be compensated. It is wrong to characterise the decision as one to exclude a particular category of abuse victims. It <Col N="1313" /> is in fact an initiative whereby the State seeks to compensate people for whom it had a special responsibility and who, notwithstanding that, were abused.</P>
    <P>In the case of children in primary and post-primary schools, the State did not exercise the kind of regulatory and supervisory functions which applied to children in residential care and indeed, in general, the schools operated with considerable independence from the State. In those circumstances the Government considers that the payment of compensation from public funds for acts of people over whom the State had no control and in schools in respect of which State bodies had very limited functions would not be appropriate. However, the Government is concerned to ensure that victims of such abuse have available to them other remedies for legal redress. To that end, the Statute of Limitations has been amended to allow people who were sexually abused, and especially those who assisted in criminal investigations, to sue their abusers and-or the employers for damage caused to them. In addition, in the case of physical abuse, the Government has asked the Law Reform Commission &ndash; LRC &ndash; to consider the issue and make recommendations. The LRC has now issued a discussion paper as part of a wider consultation process on this issue.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by my officials that they are aware of 11 former or retired primary school teachers who have been convicted of offences relating to sexual abuse of children and of five retired or former post-primary school teachers. Apart from this, information of the kind requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department. </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The judgment to which the Deputy refers runs to 69 pages and three appendices of over 100 pages. It deals with a range of complex issues and has very significant implications, not just for the education of persons with special needs, but, more generally, for the education system. It raises fundamental issues regarding the State's obligation to provide education services for persons over 18 years and the nature of such services. The full implications of the judgment are currently being studied in my Department and the Deputy will appreciate that I am, therefore, <Col N="1314" /> somewhat constrained in commenting in detail on the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>Since October 1998 my Department has formally recognised the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this decision, children with autism have been catered for in special dedicated classes in special schools or attached to ordinary schools. Each such class has operated at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has had the support of a special needs assistant. To date, a total of 63 such classes have been established and further classes will be established in response to assessed needs.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced a range of important new measures which will significantly enhance the support services provided by my Department for children with autism. These include: the immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for all children with autism; the extension of the school year through the month of July, in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided for each special class catering for children with autism; the appointment of an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism to advise my Department on the development of services in this area and to liaise with the special task force on autism which I recently established and which is due to report to me within three months; the appointment of a clinical psychologist to assist my Department in the process of identifying individual children with autism for whom a special response is required.</P>
      <P>I am also establishing an interdepartmental team of high level officials involving my Department and the Department of Health and Children to co-ordinate our response to the needs of persons with autism. I am confident that this arrangement will further strengthen the close co-ordination which already exists between my Department and the Department of Health and Children and its agents in this area.</P>
      <P>My Department is also in ongoing contact with the Department of Finance in relation to developments in the special needs area. Indeed, I wish to acknowledge the Department's positive response in this area as reflected in the very significant growth in the level of additional resources which have been devoted to the special education area in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue raised by the Deputy in relation to access to information on the full range of available services is very important. It is my intention to ensure that parents of children with special needs are facilitated in having ready access to all the information they require. In this connection, a planning group was established in my Department in 1999 to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure that the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities. The objective is to develop a system which is responsive to the needs of children with disabilit<Col N="1315" /> ies and their parents. I expect to receive the report of the planning group very shortly. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The current operational capacity of St. Michael's remand and assessment unit is 15 places. Children are normally referred to St. Michael's by the courts for short-term remand and remand for assessment. However, the unit's capacity to carry out assessment is reduced from time to time because the courts place children in the unit while why are awaiting long-term placement elsewhere. Currently, there are eight such cases being accommodated in the unit.</P>
      <P>There are currently 13 young persons awaiting assessment at the unit. The young person to whom the Deputy refers was scheduled on 15 October 2000 for admission for assessment on 15 January next.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the shortage of places for assessment to which the Deputy refers. My Department is actively pursuing the development of a non-residential assessment service in the probation and welfare service and the health authorities. It is expected that the service will provide an additional option for the courts with effect from early 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department is also currently pursuing a five year development plan in the young offender area. The development plan includes the replacement of St. Michael's remand and assessment centre by a new facility to be known as the National Remand and Assessment Centre. The capacity of the new centre will be 20 places. The overall cost of this development is estimated to be £13 million. It is expected that the project will be going to tender early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers. The pupil in question was assessed as having a mild general learning disability and was originally enrolled in a special school in Cork which caters for these children from four to 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>I understand that following the family's move to the Bandon area, the boy was enrolled in a special class for pupils with mild general learning disability at Bandon boys' national school. I understand that he remained there until June 1999 when he completed his primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following his departure from Bandon national school, consideration was given to placing the boy <Col N="1318" /> in question in a special class at Bandon post primary school. However, such a placement was not considered appropriate to meet the child's particular special needs and he returned to the special school in which he was originally enrolled.</P>
    <P>My Department has allocated funding to this special school to facilitate the appointment of escorts on each of its special transport services. The school authorities have recently informed my Department that they are currently in the process of recruiting escorts for each of their special transport services, including the service previously availed of by the boy in question. Bus Éireann, which operates the service in question, has indicated that the boy will be accommodated on the service as soon as the escort is in place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual programmes of care and education are provided for the young people referred by the <Col N="1319" /> courts to Trinity House school. The main objective of these programmes is to rehabilitate the young people concerned so that they may return to live normal lives with their families and community. Attendance at courses away from the school and home leave programmes can form an integral part of care plans that are intended to gradually prepare the young person for their re-entry into the community and family. Such absences are normally of short duration. The young people in question are required to return to the school following such absences and the school has a responsibility to be able to accommodate the boys on their return. The school must also retain the capacity to accommodate boys who abscond from care at the school. Consequently, a placement allocated to a particular young person is required to be available to the young person in question while in the care of the school and cannot therefore be made available to another young person.</P>
    <P>On the night of 16 October 2000, Trinity House school had a capacity for 22 young people. Fifteen of the places were allocated to boys who were in residence on the night; four places to boys who were on short-term leave with their families; and three places to boys who had absconded and were at large. </P>

      <P>The director and board of management of Trinity House school are responsible for ensuring that all relevant legislation, including the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, is complied with within the school. The position is that the majority of young people admitted to Trinity House school have been smoking for a number of years and are already addicted to the habit by the time they are referred to the school. Once admitted to the school, the policy of the school is to educate the boys to stop smoking. Young people who smoked prior to admittance to Trinity House are given cigarettes which they are allowed to smoke in a restricted way within the school. Young people who do not smoke in Trinity House or who give up smoking are rewarded positively. Cigarettes are not sold to the young people in Trinity House school, nor are they given as a reward.</P>
      <P>Management of the school is currently undertaking a review of smoking at the centre with a view to making the school a smoke free area.

      <P>The unit cost per place provided at Trinity House school, including staff and equipment, for 1999 was £97,792.72. Trinity House school is the only secure centre in operation for juvenile offenders in the State and requires high staffing levels and security measures.

      <P>The budget allocation that was agreed between my Department and the management of Trinity House school for the year 2000 is £2,505,893. This allocation covers the cost of the pay and the non-pay expenditure of the school, excluding the salary costs of the teaching staff. The school is licensed to accommodate 30 boys but has a normal operational capacity of 24.</P>
      <P>There are 34.5 wholetime care staff and ten teachers employed in Trinity House school.

The compulsory school starting age in a primary school is six years of age while a child must be at least four years of age before she-he can be enrolled in a primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boards of management of primary schools are charged with the direct governance of schools and the enrolment of pupils is a matter for those boards. While parents are usually able to have their children enrolled in the school of their choice, local circumstances may be such at a particu<Col N="1321" /> lar time, that a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to those children from a particular area or a particular age group.</P>
    <P>Similarly, enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of the individual school and my Department does not have a role in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. It is accepted that where schools receive more enrolment applications than they can cater for, a selection procedure is necessary. Schools adopt different selection procedures in such cases.</P>
    <P>My main responsibility as Minister for Education and Science is to ensure that there are sufficient places available to cater for the needs of pupils at primary and post-primary levels.

      <P>In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios were advised that they could seek a remedial service where they could demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department allocated an additional 148 full-time remedial teacher posts and 27 part-time posts to facilitate the extension of the service to all primary schools. A further 15 remedial teacher <Col N="1322" /> posts were subsequently allocated to meet the remedial needs of a number of very large schools which had only one post. All available posts have been utilised to ensure that no primary school in the country is without a remedial service.</P>
    <P>The school to which the Deputy refers already has the services of a full-time remedial teacher. However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy applied for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project in 1996. All applicant schools were assessed by the Educational Research Centre as to priority of need on the basis of criteria devised by the centre. Unfortunately, based on the data received at that time, the schools referred to did not rank high enough on the priority list to warrant inclusion in the pilot project.</P>
      <P>The schools in question are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and receive supplementary capitation funding at a rate of £30 per pupil. In addition, because of their disadvantaged status, the schools share the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and are included in the home-school-community liaison scheme. </P>
      <P>The operation of the current phase of the Breaking the Cycle project is being monitored by my Department's inspectorate and is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre. A key objective of the review process is to establish the appropriateness and effectiveness of the distinct approaches to urban and rural disadvantage, which are being tested under the pilot project. The question of extending the project to additional schools will be considered in the light of experience gained in the pilot phase.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system. To this end, I am currently finalising a tailored package of resources for each school with significant concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. I will be making a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly. </P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. Should the Deputy require information on any particular school I would be glad to provide it.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress to construction for a capital project depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and a fire certificate and the outcome of the tender competition.</P>
      <P>These processes are by their nature complex and can take a considerable period of time to complete. Delays can arise at any point in the process, consequently it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will proceed to construction.

In all cases, the school authorities will be kept informed of progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 487 and 493 together.</P>
      <P>Teaching posts may be sanctioned provisionally to primary schools which qualify for developing school status. Such schools must satisfy specific criteria as follows: a school which has less than 298 pupils is required to increase its enrolment by 25 pupils over the previous school year, and must also exceed the point on the schedule where the next post is due by a minimum of five pupils; a school which has 299 or more pupils is required to increase its enrolment by 30 pupils over the previous school year, and must also exceed the point on the schedule where the next post is due by a minimum of ten pupils.</P>
      <P>A total of 71 such posts have been provisionally sanctioned for the current school year. The enrolments at 30 September 2000 in the relevant schools are currently being verified so that the posts can be made permanent, where applicable.</P>
      <P>Teaching posts may also be sanctioned provisionally to disadvantaged schools where the maximum class size is greater than 29:1. Such schools may apply for an additional post when they cannot organise their classes in compliance with the above guideline based on 30 September enrolment for the current year. A total of seven such posts have been provisionally sanctioned for the current school year. Again, the enrolments at 30 September 2000 in the relevant schools are currently being verified so that the posts can be made permanent, where applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by a staffing schedule, which is formulated annually following discussions with the education partners. These discussions usually take place in the months of December and January, when details <Col N="1325" /> of all schools' enrolments are available. It would not be practical to change the existing regulations as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question on 30 September 1999 of 52 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and one mainstream classroom teacher, which is the same staffing as the school had for the 1999-2000 school year. The school also has the services of a shared learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>An enrolment of 56 pupils on 30 September 1999 was required in order to appoint the second mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year. As the staffing schedule for the 2001-02 school year has not yet been finalised, the staffing for that school year cannot be predicted at this stage. Unfortunately, therefore, it is not open to me to sanction the appointment of a temporary teacher for the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds the provision of PE facilities in second level schools on the basis of each individual school's enrolment. Schools with enrolments in excess of 450 students may qualify for a PE hall of 806 mf7&gt;2 while schools with an enrolment below 450 students qualify for a hall of 608 mf7&gt;2? In the case of schools with an enrolment of less than 200 students, the size of the PE facility to be provided is assessed on an individual basis. Clearly, this policy position reflects the realities of the larger schools having greater demands than smaller schools.</P>
      <P>Ideally, where two or more second level schools operate in close proximity to each other, my Department would prefer that a single enlarged PE hall facility be provided to accommodate the needs of the schools concerned. In this way, an entire community can derive benefit from a significantly larger facility. However, the provision of such facilities requires agreement between all parties. Where the schools cannot reach such an agreement, the standard size facilities, based on their enrolments, are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A long-term enrolment projection for a post-primary school is arrived at following a detailed analysis of previous enrolment patterns at the school, together with projected output from primary schools in the catchment area over the next <Col N="1327" /> eight years. Account is taken, also, of other factors such as significant housing development, which might affect the school-going population in the area. If the authorities of a school do not agree with my Department's assessment of its long-term enrolment, my Department undertakes a review of the projections, having regard to any additional influencing factors of which my Department was not initially aware.</P>

      <P>The position, generally, is that eligibility for school transport is determined by reference to age and distance from the nearest suitable school. In order to be eligible for free transport, children under ten years of age must live at least two miles from, and be attending their nearest national school, while older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
      <P>Where a child is attending a school other than the nearest, it is necessary to obtain the written agreement of the board of management of the nearest school to the provision of fare paying transport. By seeking the written agreement of the nearest school before allowing this concession, there can be no question of my Department facilitating a change in enrolment patterns or encouraging children to leave their appropriate nearest school.</P>
      <P>A board of management is entitled to refuse to sign a written agreement in respect of pupils who are eligible for transport to its school, and who wish to avail of concessionary fare paying transport to another school. In circumstances where written agreement is not forthcoming, my Department is not in a position to provide transport facilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of indi<Col N="1328" /> vidual schools.

    <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting.

    <P>The information in the above table is based on data submitted to my Department by the managerial authorities of primary schools. The Deputy <Col N="1329" /> may be aware that an overall maximum class size guideline of 29:1 operates for schools designated as disadvantaged. The staffing schedule for the 2000-01 school year is structured to ensure that primary schools operate to a general maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
    <P>Although the overall enrolment within a school may be organised within the recommended guidelines, some schools choose to organise their classes in such a way that some classes exceed the guidelines while others are well within the guidelines. Where the guidelines are breached in a particular class, therefore, this usually results from a conscious decision taken by the school management with a view to facilitating much smaller classes elsewhere in the school.</P>
    <P>The Government since taking up office has introduced a range of initiatives to help reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio has declined from 22.2 : 1 in the 1996-97 school year to 20.4 : 1 in the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
    <P>The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the current year together with the creation of an additional 200 posts primarily to tackle educational disadvantage will reduce the overall pupil-teacher ratio in the 2000-01 school year to 19.6:1.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is proposed to appoint an additional 900 primary teachers in the course of the next few years. These additional posts will ensure that the overall pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools will continue to decline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Students aged at least 23 years on 1 January of their year of entry to third level education are defined as mature students. While the total number of mature students currently in universities and institutes of technology is not readily available, a number of estimates have been made. The final report of the commission on the points system, published in December 1999, states that the most recent figures then available suggested that about 5% of those entering full-time undergraduate higher education courses were mature students. Statistical information from the Higher Education Authority for the 1998-99 academic year indicates that mature students account for almost 6.3% of all new entrants to full-time undergraduate programmes in the Higher Education Authority sector. In the 1998-99 academic year out of a total enrolment of 23,823 on post-leaving certificate courses, 5,457 students were aged 23 years or over.</P>
      <P>The commission on the points system recommended that by 2005, each institution should set aside a quota of at least 15% of places for students entering at age 23 years or over. It also highlighted a need for greater opportunities for students to return to third level education on a part-time basis. The points commission did not cost this recommendation.</P>
      <P>The report of the review committee on post-secondary education and training identified the need to increase provision for mature students and recommended the provision of an additional stock of up to 10,000 places for mature students to be built up over a period of years, primarily but not exclusively by increased part-time provision and other flexible options such as distance learning. It estimated that the recurrent cost of an additional 10,000 flexible places would be £30 million per year when all places are on stream. This estimate assumes the maintenance of the existing ratio of full-time to part-time places and the application of an average weighting of 0.5 to the part-time element. The report also estimated a capital cost of nearly £60 million.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of information about the demand from mature students which was highlighted by both the points commission and the review committee on post-secondary education. My Department has requested the Higher Education Authority to undertake market research to establish the level and range of demand from mature students. The authority has also been requested to bring forward proposals in relation to the provision of mature student places.</P>
      <P>I have recently established an action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by mature and disadvantaged students and students with disabilities to third level education. The group will provide a report on its findings and recommendations to me within three months of commencing its work.</P>
      <P>The group will make recommendations in relation to the barriers to participation by mature students in higher education and will have specific regard to the commitment in the PPF that colleges will aim to provide that by 2005, 15% of their intake each year will comprise students aged 23 years or over.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): Since the Government decision of October 1998, which allowed for an automatic response to all children with disabilities in primary education, a total of 447 full-time resource teacher posts and a further 4,525 part-time resource teaching hours have been allocated. Over the same period, a total of 1,311 special needs assistants and a further 4,609.5 part time special needs assistant hours have been allocated. The total annual cost of these allocations amounts to approximately £13 million in respect of resource teacher support and approximately £20 million in respect of special needs assistant support.</P>
    <P>The equivalent of 70 whole-time child care assistants posts and 240 whole-time resource posts have been allocated at second level at a total estimated cost of £6.7 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned with the issue of early school leaving. The main focus of my Department in relation to early school leaving is to have the particular pupil return to school as quickly as possible. In this regard, my Department liaises with the school authorities with a view to having the pupil returned to his-her former school or securing an alternative suitable school placement. Each case, which comes to the attention of my Department, is treated on an individual basis having regard to the child's educational needs.</P>
      <P>To combat the problem of early school leaving, I have initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently enacted Education Welfare Act, 2000 will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board to co-ordinate and implement services for children in difficulty within the school system on a national basis. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and to foster an <Col N="1334" /> appreciation of learning among the students. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. Planning for the implementation of the Act is currently under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to targeted initiatives, a number of pilot projects were introduced in selected primary schools including the Early Start pre-school project, Breaking the Cycle and support teacher project. At second level, curricular reform, including the introduction of the junior certificate school programme, the transition year programme and the leaving certificate applied, has increased the range of options available to meet young people's educational needs.</P>
    <P>More recently, the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative and the stay-in-school retention initiative were introduced. One of the key objectives of the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. In addition, a key focus of actions under the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative is on targeting young people in the eight to 15 year old age group who have already left school, focused on their progression over time from an alternative form of provision to mainstream schools. The initiative, which involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas, was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. I have decided to extend the existing 17 projects for a further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002.</P>
    <P>The stay-in-school retention initiative at second level marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates.</P>
    <P>I am currently working on proposals for a major new scheme aimed at addressing educational disadvantage at primary level. This scheme will target those areas with the greatest needs in order to maximise participation and the potential for achievement in education. The supports will involve a mixture of additional teachers and resources. I will be making a further announcement in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is available to advise on the management of difficulties which pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports, which might be required to ensure that a pupils time in school is as productive as possible. At primary level, my Department has introduced a range of improvements in the level and quality of special education supports. There are currently 1,480 remedial teachers <Col N="1335" /> and the equivalent of 560 resource teachers in primary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 504, 505, 507 and 508 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not prescribe any special rules for the treatment of pregnant schoolgirls by school authorities. However, my Department would expect that in dealing with any particular case, school management would have regard to the sensitivity of the situation and would have as its priority the well-being of the pupil concerned. My Department would hope that pregnancy would cause no more than a temporary absence from school and each pupil would be in a position to resume her education following the birth of the child.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that no two sets of circumstances will be identical and, accordingly, management practice will vary from case to case. Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving suitable medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl's needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.</P>
      <P>Home tuition is provided for pregnant schoolgirls who are pupils at recognised schools. It is provided for pupils who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby, when attendance may be impractical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> The intention is to provide compensatory instruction during the time immediately before or after the birth of their babies when attendance at school may be impractical. It is intended that the tuition will minimise the disruption to the girls' education and so maximise their chance of continuing in school to complete the senior cycle, which is in line with Government policy to improve school retention rates; that it will enable pupils to sit the junior certificate or leaving certificate examinations at the earliest possible opportunity, and that it will be an indication to schools which are expected to support pregnant schoolgirls that my Department is willing to offer these pupils some practical support.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made at examination time for a pregnant school girl depend on her particular circumstances at the time.</P>
    <P>A candidate may not wish to sit for her examinations in the main centre, in which case she may take her exams in a special room in the school. If a candidate is in hospital, arrangements can be made for her to take her exams there.</P>
    <P>If a candidate feels unwell during the course of the examinations, she may be allowed to leave the examination centre and be readmitted provided that she has been in the care of the principal or a representative of the school authority during her absences. In exceptional circumstances, a candidate may take the examinations at a later time than the scheduled time but on the same day.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have any research data available on teenage pregnancy, information on the number of teenage pregnancies in the years 1995 to 2000, the number of young women who have been unable to remain in second level education in these circumstances, the number of young pregnant women continuing in second level education or details on the practice in other EU countries.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase the rates of third level maintenance grants annually in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant and 5% in the qualifying income limits for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to February. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
      <P>Tentative indications are that in the region of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incen<Col N="1339" /> tives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>
    <P>These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage, rather than an across the board increase in grant levels which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>While My Department has no specific scheme for the purpose of paying an allowance to meet expenditure incurred in the purchase of third level textbooks, it does operate a number of student support schemes, which provide for means-tested higher education maintenance grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the support schemes, the reckonable income of a candidate, other than an independent mature candidate, for the purposes of the means test is his-her gross income from all sources, and the gross income of his-her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt, including the means-tested one parent family payments administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>As the person to whom the Deputy refers is under 23 years of age she cannot be assessed as a mature student and, therefore, parental income must be taken into account. If she has not already done so, she should contact the relevant local authority in order that her eligibility for grant assistance may be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the maintenance grant schemes, support is also available to students through my Department's student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions <Col N="1341" /> and provides direct financial support for disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Deputy may wish to advise the person in question to make application to the student welfare officer, or other officer responsible for administering the fund, in the college she is attending, for assistance from the fund.</P>

      <P>In general terms, enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>My Department is actively working to find a suitable school placement for this student. I wish to assure the Deputy that should there be any delay in this regard home tuition will be sanctioned by my Department.</P>
