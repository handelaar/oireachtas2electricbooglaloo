      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Quinn and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to give notice of my intention to seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely the continuing serious disruption to second level education and in particular the problems for students facing examinations arising from action taken by members of ASTI and the urgent need for a Government initiative to try to seek a solution to the dispute, especially in light of the threat of increased action over the coming weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 23, motion re Referral to Joint Committee of the Report on Clinical Vaccine Trials; No. 47, Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 1, Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage; No. 48, Statements on the Irish Language in the 21st Century &ndash; Ráitis maidir leis an nGaeilge san 21ú hAois &ndash; to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of Matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) No. 23 shall be decided without debate; and (2) the proceedings on No. 48, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes; and (iii) Members may share time.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 23 agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantive amendment has been tabled by the Fine Gael Party to this motion. There is a clear divergence in that we believe a committee of the House should investigate this issue and that sending it to the Laffoy commission is a way of long-fingering it. The committee should be empowered to investigate it.</P>
      <P>If the Government proceeds in the way it suggests, the committee will not be able to do anything because the Government has foreclosed any activity the committee may undertake on this matter which is of concern to public representatives and the people they represent. For these reasons, we should be allowed to make these points, however briefly, in a debate. Perhaps the Taoiseach would agree to a debate of approximately 20 minutes or 30 minutes on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" />
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points of concern. The report should go to the committee. I am disappointed that the Government has not accepted the excellent legal advice from the Labour Party. It might have been considered belt and braces, but I have seldom seen lawyers reject an additional belt where one is offered in good faith. The advice I received from my Whip is to the effect that the Government do not think it is necessary.</P>
      <P>Many cases have subsequently failed in another court because adequate protection was not taken when offered in a constructive way. However, that is the prerogative of the Government. Despite the reasons that the Government has decided not to accept it, we believe there is an unnecessary risk and, therefore, the motion in its current form is unacceptable. I support the proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Party that there should also be a debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports are usually referred to a committee without any debate in the House. However, if the House feels a short debate during the morning of approximately 20 minutes is desirable, I will not object to it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for raising the issues. I undertook to consider them and there are two points that may resolve the matter. I have been advised by the Attorney General that the definition of abuse in the Inquiry into Child Abuse Act, 2000, includes any wilful infliction of physical injury or failure to prevent such injury to a child and any failure to care for a child or act or omission towards a child which has serious adverse effects on the child's behaviour or welfare.</P>
      <P>In so far as clinical trials are alleged to have been conducted without the appropriate consent and in so far as these trials are alleged to have included the use of injections and intra-nasal administration of drugs, clearly an issue arises as to whether any such trial amounts in law to an assault or unlawful invasion of the physical integrity of the children involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, the consequences of participating in any such trials are matters relating to the welfare of the children. All these issues fall within the scope of the commission as expressed in section 1 of the Act. The suggestion, helpfully made by Deputy McManus, was that acts must be proved to amount to abuse and to have affected the welfare of the child before the commission can inquire into them and therefore, it does not stand. The wording of the Act, in particular section 4(1)<i>(v)</i> makes it clear that one of the functions of the commission is to establish whether acts capable of amounting to abuse actually occurred or whether it is a matter of fact such acts amount to abuse rather than what effect they had on any children concerned. On the second point made by Deputy Quinn, that we must make sure we tie this down and do not run into difficulties, I asked the Attorney General to consult the Laffoy commission to make sure that we know about all matters. The Laffoy commission proposes to consider <Col N="280" /> the issues raised by the report as a separate heading within its inquiry. They will examine what they need separately within the inquiry. The commission will consider whether any order under section 4(4) is necessary or appropriate to assist the commission in this respect. They will examine the report and if there is any aspect they believe under section 4(4) that they need to tie down tighter, they will come back to us. I assure the House that the Government's intention is to fully consult the commission on that issue as envisaged by the Act and to make that necessary order which is provided for in the Act under section 4(4). If any such order is made, it will need the approval of the House. I hope that deals with the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I clarify with the Taoiseach whether he is making an amended proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton suggested &ndash; and Deputy Quinn agreed &ndash; that we would have a 20 minute debate. The Government Whip has told me that we could do that at 12.30 p.m. today. My amendment is that we have a 20 minute debate between 12.30 p.m. and 12.50 p.m. today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reasonable and the fact that the Taoiseach has read so much into the record will be of use to Members participating in the debate, who will be able to respond at that time in the debate to the points made by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil resumes next Tuesday, it will be the day after the entire DART <Col N="282" /> system will have closed down leaving 80,000 Dubliners who use that means of transport stranded and the day before the suburban and national rail system is to close down, leaving 50,000 daily users of that transport system stranded. In the past 24 hours, what has the Taoiseach done about this situation? Has he any sense that he is in charge of transport or of Government as far as this vital service is concerned? Has the Taoiseach himself done anything about this matter in the past 24 hours?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same matter, a Cheann Comhairle, you have ruled out of order, as is your prerogative, a request from me on Standing Order 31 and the House will be riveted in discussing the future of the Irish language in the 21st century this afternoon. Since the Taoiseach indicated yesterday that industrial relations machinery is available to the State and that machinery does not appear to be adequately working in respect of either the teachers, the drivers in CIE and elsewhere, perhaps he might go looking for the person in his Cabinet who is responsible for the industrial relations machinery, the Scarlet Pimpernel of Dáil Éireann, the Tánaiste, who refuses to come in here until she skulks in for a vote. Perhaps we might receive some explanation from the person charged with Cabinet responsibility for the operation of industrial relations as to why there has been a breakdown in State run services where recommendations from the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court are not being accepted by one section of the social partners. It is time the Tánaiste was in the House speaking on the matters for which she is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had several discussions with the Minister for Public Enterprise over the past 24 hours. The Minister and senior officials of her Department met the management of Iarnród Éireann, yesterday, 15 November. A meeting is taking place at present between the Minister and senior officials of the Department with the Congress of Trade Unions, SIPTU and the NBRU representatives and a meeting is arranged with IBEC for this afternoon. The Minister and the Government are doing all they can to resolve the range of disputes covered under CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any personal sense of how appalling the public transport system is in Dublin? Even when the DART is working &ndash; and I know the Taoiseach is familiar with Clontarf DART station because he lives not too far from it &ndash; people who want to take the DART in the morning at Clontarf must take the train out to Raheny because it is so full when it arrives in Clontarf they cannot get on. They must go out to Raheny to get on the train to come in past Clontarf into Dublin. That is a system that would have been described as squalid if it had occurred in the Indian sub-continent in the 19th century but it is not acceptable in Ireland in the <Col N="283" /> 21st century. The Taoiseach is presiding over these crowded trains where there will have to be pushers to push people on the trains soon because there is no room on them. Everything is slowing down to a snail's pace, the Taoiseach is in charge and he is not able to do the job.</P>

Is the Civil Defence and the emergency relief it provides not a priority with this Government? Does that account for the delay?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been described as non-contentious and technical. I could think of a few other adjectives to describe it, such as turgid and boring. It is not the type of legislation on which one is likely to be accosted on a regular basis in the local public house or to have representations from constituents. However, it is necessary. It highlights the importance of intellectual property rights and their capacity to act as the economic engine which drives industrial development and creates job opportunities. It also gives us an opportunity to raise a number of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plethora of legislation which has been enacted in this House in the 1990s alone begs the question of whether the Patents Office, which I understand is now in Kilkenny, has the necessary staff to carry out the additional duties and responsibilities which are being foisted on it. I ask the Minister of State when replying to assure the House that that office has the financial and human resources to implement and administer the legislation and to deal with public inquiries on patents. There is an increasing awareness of the patent issue. This is a relatively innovative society and it would be regrettable if we could <Col N="289" /> not capitalise on that as a result of inadequate staff or financial resources in the Patents Office.</P>
    <P>Innovation is not a guarantee of economic prosperity. We have often met people with great ideas who cannot see them through to fruition. This raises another question about the potential of each invention. Are we adequately facilitating business angels and providing technical supports to bring on stream those innovations? We could look at the curriculum in our education system to see if we support innovation and if we are capable of matching it with the necessary entrepreneurial skills and financial resources. If we can do that, we will have a recipe for economic success.</P>
    <P>Much legislation was passed in this area during the 1990s. The Patents Act was passed in 1992, the Trade Marks Act was passed in 1996 and the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was passed in 1998. This section of the Department has been extremely busy and have come under pressure from events outside its control.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> for this Bill is twofold, namely, the World Trade Organisation talks, the TRIPs agreement and the European patent convention. It highlights the growing importance of intellectual property. My understanding of the necessary trade off in terms of the World Trade Organisation is that the European Union placed considerable importance on intellectual property rights. However, in doing so it may have traded off certain areas of interest about which I have reservations.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the <i>raison d'être</i> at European and world trade talks level that there is an attempt to harmonise the legal framework for patents. That is desirable because we are increasingly operating in a global village where an idea in Bangkok, if it is placed in an appropriate legal framework, can be exploited in Ballyvourney in my constituency to the benefit of the originator of the patent and the person capable of bringing it to economic reality. There is, therefore, a need to put in place a world-wide framework.</P>
    <P>The history of this originated in the Industrial Revolution. The first attempt was the Paris Convention, 1883, which has been revised on several occasions. Approximately 157 countries have signed up to it. I am not sure if it has a legal framework but it is indicative of the growing importance of putting in place the kind of framework proposed in this legislation. The Patent Co-Operation Treaty, signed in Washington in 1970, was followed by the European Patent Convention in 1973, which established the office in Munich. A number of directives have arisen from that and I understand more are envisaged in the near future. The relevant section in the Minister of State's Department will be very busy dealing with these provisions. When replying to this debate I ask him to assure the House that the necessary resources will be provided, not only within his Department but in the Patents Office.</P>
    <P>We have received a number of submissions by innovative people who have approached the Pat<Col N="290" /> ents Office. It has been suggested that the <i>modus operandi</i> of the office is not user friendly and that considerable financial costs are incurred by those pursuing to a successful conclusion the issue of a patent through the office. This week the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business received a presentation from the Inventors Association of Ireland. Given the shortcomings they perceive at the Patents Office they are seeking Exchequer funding to make up the shortfall. They also want to establish the title of Global Inventions Management Limited, a company that will be more user friendly and approachable than the Patents Office.</P>
    <P>The association raises serious allegations because the inference is that people with very worthwhile ideas are being short changed by the Patents Office, that they find the technical and administrative side unhelpful and that excessive cost barriers are being put in their way. In view of this they say people are not pursuing the issue of a patent. While the Minster of State may not wish to comment on the proposal to establish Global Inventions Management Limited, of which I am sure he has received a proposal, it would be appropriate for him to comment on the issue of resources and on the need to make the Patents Office user friendly and approachable and on the need to ensure that it is not excessively expensive to have the issue of a patent successfully concluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, raised the issue of exemptions to the rule of patentability. He outlined three permissible exemptions. First, where the commercial exploitation of same would be contrary to the public order or morality. That is understandable. Second, inventions concerning diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for treatment of humans or animals may be exempted. I am not sure what is involved here. Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate. Third, member countries may exclude from patentability plants and animals other than micro-organisms and what are essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals other than non-biological and micro-biological processes. This is a potential minefield.</P>
    <P>Legislators, both here and elsewhere, have been exposed as being inadequate in terms of keeping up with advances in genetic engineering and micro-biology. The Government has established a working committee to look at this. Recently there was much fanfare about the mapping of the human genome. I do not understand all of its potential uses, but would it be desirable for somebody to patent that and thereby secure exclusive rights to the commercial exploitation of the human genome? I am not sure if there is a vocabulary and lexicon associated with this area, or if these two issue are entirely related. Nevertheless, there is considerable public concern about the lack of an adequate legal framework within which this industry operates. Do the patent <Col N="291" /> exemptions outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, apply to the human genome? Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify this.</P>
    <P>This is by and large a technical Bill. There is unlikely to be any strong objection to it in principle. We will study it in greater detail before Committee Stage with a view to assisting the Minister of State in passing optimum legislation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission has proposed the introduction of a common Community patent system, saying that it will save small businesses thousands of pounds in patenting costs while at the same time giving EU wide protection to the inventions of many who have been unable to afford it in the past. At present, businesses may apply to a European patent office for a European patent, but in reality what is available is a collection of national patents, each subject to a set of different national rules.</P>
      <P>The purpose of any patent regime is to strike a balance between the interest of the inventor, the investor and the public, so that there is an incentive to produce knowledge and to use it as widely as possible. Lawsuits on the basis of patent infringement, particularly patents issued for the business method of using technologies in a particular way, are currently the subject of debate in the US. The criticism of such patents is that the patents throttle new markets by giving a formidable first mover the advantage to file first for a patent on a general process &ndash; an idea of how something might be done rather than a concrete invention like a machine. Supporters of such patenting in the digital age say that ideas and knowledge, not inventions, should be capable of being patented property.</P>
      <P>The cost of applying for a patent for a small company is prohibitive in Europe because of an expensive document translation service. In effect this means that applying for a European patent is three to five times more expensive than, for example, applying for an American or Japanese one.</P>
      <P>The criterion for granting a patent to an inventor is that the invention must be novel &ndash; no other person can have made it public. It must also be innovative and useful and cannot simply be a discovery. Software development is a particularly confusing and complex area, one which is developing with enormous speed. Without an adequate licensing agreement, developers could lose control of their intellectual property while companies which hire a firm to develop software for them do not have ownership of the programme unless an agreement assigns the rights to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patenting of the human genome is a new area in which patenting is already big business. To date, some 9,364 patents relating to the human genome have been filed. The applications cover 126,672 genes or partial sequences. For example, nine patents have been applied for on the genes <Col N="292" /> which determine a person's eyeball and 40 for a person's heart. Two genes where mutations give women a predisposition to develop breast cancer have been identified and a dispute is ongoing about the ownership of that gene. A Japanese firm has been granted a worldwide patent on an unnamed human gene, the natural chemical which produces it and the use of that chemical for the treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary escalation in the rush to patent the blueprint for life in all its forms from the tiniest microbe to the mouse. The reason for this rush is not difficult to understand. The fast developing genetic sciences and patent law are two areas of interest and enormous complexity. Chromosome 22 is the smallest of the 23 pairs of chromosomes and is significant in that it contains genes related to, among other things, schizophrenia, mental retardation and congenital heart disease. Once the other 22 chromosomes have been decoded, it is believed that we will be on the brink of a revolution in medicine. Drugs will be customised to patients' needs based on their genetic make-up and earlier and more specific diagnoses will be possible. A study completed earlier this year suggested that by 2009, sales of DNA based treatments will exceed £45 billion.</P>
    <P>A patent is no more than a temporary protection which prevents others from making money from one's discovery. Once businesses have filed a patent claim, they can publish and other researchers throughout the world can use what could be valuable information in a variety of ways. If people can afford a patent, they can risk the ten years and £100 million required to take a drug from idea to pharmacy counter.</P>
    <P>The first gene based patents were made 20 years ago but these were few in number and many were never exploited. In the past few years, the biotech companies have been sprinting from the laboratory to the patent office with armfuls of applications. There has been intermittent anger and anxiety but very little debate on this issue. The level of awareness and concern about this issue is dangerously low. Genes have become intellectual property to be kept on a shelf, licensed to the highest bidder or simply lost in the tangle of takeovers and bankruptcy which is inevitable in the new high risk industries. Even modest sized biotech companies have been filing patents at the rate of 100 per week.</P>
    <P>The opponents of gene patenting argue that genes are pure discovery. However, the modern automated gene analysis technology makes gene innovation doubtful. Naturally occurring life forms cannot be patented but genetically engineered plants and animals, such as genetically modified maize and laboratory mice designed to be prone to cancer, can. So, too, can the naturally occurring chemical codes and substances which allow all plants and animals, including humans, to function on a cellular level, like genes or hormones, as long as the inventor can specify a use for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Holding a patent on human, animal or plant genes gives the holder control over the commercial exploitation of that gene. If it is a human gene, that may involve diagnosis or therapy for a disease. If it is a plant or animal gene, it may also involve disease, the promotion of desirable characteristics such as a sweet taste or the transfer of a gene from one organism to another. Many biotechnology companies hold that genes must be patentable to allow firms to recoup their investment in identifying them. Other firms fear that allowing genes to be patented before any specific proven use has been established will hold back medical science.</P>
    <P>Doctors and scientists in search of causes and cures for diseases started the systematic search for this information 20 years ago on diseases such as Huntingtons, muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis. At that time, charities and families who were hoping for a cure or mitigation often raised the money for this research. The search has since widened and accelerated. It has gone from muscular dystrophy to maize and has covered many other areas in between. It will be wonderful if the new products and new cures which may emerge are widely available. Their wide availability is a key point in this debate. There is a concern that natural resources, intended to help the hungry, sick and desperate will be hijacked and cornered by the rich and powerful who will use them to get richer. The gain is likely to be at the cost of those who are most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The two main reasons for worrying about the patenting of genes is that patents could increase the cost of medical research or even inhibit it. While patents clearly have a role in protecting investment and research, researchers could be deterred by the pile of patents they will have to negotiate before a drug will get on to the market. Given how little we know about how our genes work, slapping a patent on them will only slow down the advance of publicly available scientific knowledge. Developing countries argue that the knowledge economy is being stitched up for decades to come to their gross detriment, thus reinforcing a pattern of technological inequality.</P>
    <P>Now and in the future, the control of gene patenting must be carefully monitored and managed. The greed of large multinationals which have the muscle to control and manipulate must not be allowed to dominate. It is because of Third World countries, the deprived and the uninformed, that gene technology must be free and widely available. The part-sequencing of the human genome earlier this year was a huge development, one which went largely unnoticed. I believe its import will be manifested not this year or next year but in the next couple of decades. Thereafter, the financial, moral and ethical implications of this development will be very significant but it may be too late for anyone to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. There is still time to ensure the enormous ethical implications of this discovery can be managed in a positive and constructive fashion with its benefits being made <Col N="294" /> universally available. The first step would be to ensure the patenting of the genome is prohibited.</P>
    <P>Recently in Ireland, we have been confronted with the prospect of genetic testing being used by insurance companies to determine premia for life insurance purposes. The possible outcome of this is that life insurance will be denied to many people because of a potential predisposition to certain diseases. In the UK, the Government has permitted gene testing for certain diseases. The most unfortunate consequence of this decision is that people who really need to have gene testing carried out are likely not to in order to avoid the risk of being refused insurance cover. This is just one aspect of the implications of a developing technology which should be addressed urgently. The implications of this development for everyone in the community have not been appreciated. We are merely witnessing the tip of the iceberg in terms of the potential opportunities and risks associated with gene detection.</P>
    <P>The human genome project is on a scale parallel to the invention of the printing press, digital technology and any other invention which has had a profound influence on the way we live. Unless it is used positively, this information could be badly mishandled. On the positive side, properly managed and used, it could provide a cure for haemophilia, cystic fibrosis or other genetic disorders. There is a danger, however, that gene therapy could well be placed beyond the reach of the ordinary citizen as well as allowing employers to discriminate against people on the basis of their genetic predisposition. What will be the likely decision of an insurance company when a gene which predicts a predisposition to Alzheimers, cancer or heart disease can be detected?</P>
    <P>In the agri-bio industry, there is a danger of a growing concentration of ownership in the hands of a small number of major companies. Large companies continue to merge with the result that the ownership of information falls to a smaller number of companies and a monopoly develops. The expanding global food market is at stake in this regard. Population growth and economic expansion is driving up demand. The International Food Policy Research Institute expects a 40% rise in grain demand within 20 years. Arable land is becoming less available and the use of biotechnology for increasing yields is becoming attractive. However, ownership of the relevant genes, controlled by a small number of powerful brokers makes the weak and underprivileged very vulnerable. Once again it is back to the patenting of the genetic information and allowing a small powerful group, because they can afford the risk involved, to be in a position to completely control future markets.</P>
    <P>Given the scale of the issues in terms of human well-being and development, it is a scandal that the subject of gene patenting has been so neglected. Debate is urgently needed, and as the knowledge economy gathers pace, it is vital that concerns of public interest are built into its regulation through patent law. The knowledge econ<Col N="295" /> omy should be for all and not for the most powerful, who can, if they choose, be ruthless in its application and implementation.</P>
    <P>As it stands in the patents rush, there are thousands of absurd applications which are so speculative or vague that they are very unlikely to be granted. Companies and public laboratories have been applying for patents on genes of which they do not even understand the function. There are anomalies such as different patents being granted on the same gene sequence for different purposes. Only one thing is certain and that is in the years ahead patent lawyers will become very rich because it can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to defend or challenge a patent. Probably what is most worrying is the speed and scale at which patent applications are being made. It is not possible that this is prompted by a sudden outbreak of creativity and inventiveness. Unless people look at the issue seriously, unless the rules are changed, in a few years we will find the very basis of knowledge and information has been privatised.</P>
    <P>In June this year the French President, Jacques Chirac, wrote to the head of the European Commission saying gene patenting should not be permitted. Yet delegates to the conference to revise the treaty governing European patent law, opening in Munich next Monday, are not even planning to discuss gene patenting. Fears that investors will pull out of a country if patenting is prohibited has forced many countries to retain patenting of the genome.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the proposal to offer a European wide patenting system has much merit, in that it gives EU protection to inventions for those to whom it was prohibitive in the past for cost reasons. It should also offer a greater degree of legal certainty and consistency as disputes are referred to national courts which adjudicate on the basis of national law.</P>
    <P>Movement to the American market could, however, continue to present problems and without careful preparation Irish technology companies moving in to the US risk losing ownership of intellectual property such as software designs. Without an adequate licensing agreement, developers could lose control of their intellectual property, while companies which hire a firm to develop software for them will not have ownership of the programme unless an agreement assigned the rights to them. Ownership to the rights of a programme must be clear because no one will buy a property where a clear ownership trail is not established.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination of patent law is welcome at European level and in particular the making available as a right licences under this patent, thereby reducing by half the renewable fees payable to keep that patent in force, but wider implications of patenting of the human genome must also be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity it gives to debate very important issues in relation to patenting. I welcome Deputy Upton's contribution as she was fundamental to me taking an interest in this area a long time ago in Belfied.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill as the use of patents, particularly in relation to biotechnology and genetic engineering, has not been debated in Ireland. We have tried to brush it under the carpet. The debate has taken place over a number of years in the scientific community and to a certain extent is now over. The public, the Parliament and many other parliaments in the EU have failed to recognise the important impact it will have in the years ahead and the tough decisions which need to be made regarding the future of this technology and patenting legislation.</P>
      <P>While the vast majority of countries in the EU now realise this will have a major impact on the future development of their economies, and have set about introducing legislation, establishing parliamentary committees to debate it and have had debates on the floor of their Parliaments, we have failed to grasp the issue. It is a huge disappointment that we have ignored and continue to ignore the issue. We see from legislation which is pending and debates on the Order Paper that there is little relating to this area. Indeed the motion for a debate on biotechnology and genetic engineering, which commenced in the House about 12 to 18 months ago, is still on the Order Paper and the debate has not yet resumed. We need to discuss the area more thoroughly and I ask the Minister to seriously consider the report of the Oireachtas sub-committee on science and technology, which recommends that under the auspices of his Department an Oireachtas committee should be established specifically for the area of science and technology, with outside representatives from the scientific community so that some of these issues can be debated. This would perhaps allow us to come up with some of the answers which are urgently required, rather than brushing the issue under the carpet and waiting for the EU to make decisions in which the Irish Government does not seem to take an active role.</P>
      <P>Patenting concerns getting a balance between the protection of the rights of and encouraging innovation and ensuring it is not used to stall future innovation or block new developments for the benefit of the community. The points I will raise highlight some of the inadequacies which exist and show where we need to improve legislation and reform the current situation.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Creed, spoke about Ireland in general being a very innovative country, which is true. Statistical tables in this regard show Ireland mid-way in terms of EU countries when it comes to lodging patents, particularly in manufacturing. However, throughout the EU we have been slow in patenting services. The US has gone to the opposite extreme in patenting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> An important point raised by Deputy Creed was the criticism being laid at the door of Enterprise Ireland in relation to facilitating small, individual inventors who want to patent particular inventions which would hopefully be of benefit to them and the country. One issue is the cost of doing a patent search, which can range from £300 to £1,000. This may not seem much money to some people or to big industries, but it can be a prohibitive cost for individuals who may not have the financial backing or resources and may mean an innovative idea or project will not get off the ground. I ask the Minister, with his European colleagues, to examine the feasibility of establishing a proper search engine and database, such as exists in relation to DNA which allows us to check particular patents on a database over the Internet. I see no reason the same cannot be done in regard to patents. It has been an extremely useful tool in the whole area of biotechnology in the past in relation to finding out the background to a particular sequence of DNA, the genes it may form and the uses for it. Yet in the whole area of patenting the position is archaic. I am not up to speed on the procedures involved in searches but it is important to structure a proper database and use a proper search engine that could be funded through the European Union. That would dramatically reduce the cost of these searches for individuals.</P>
    <P>The second criticism which small individual inventors have is the cost of lodging their initial application, which can cost approximately £700. Those resources are not available to these inventors. I wonder whether Enterprise Ireland can be flexible in relation to these individuals and encourage innovative new ideas of net benefit to the whole community that can be patented in the future. I ask the Minister to look at the proceedings on Tuesday last of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport in which some of these criticisms were outlined.</P>
    <P>It is much easier in the US to get a patent than in Ireland or the EU where there are additional costs for those lodging a patent. There are pros and cons. There is no question but that we need to improve and streamline the position within the EU and in Ireland. It is important not to go to the extreme as in the US. Perhaps the Minister will outline how the Reach project will impact on patenting in Ireland? It is one of the key objectives of the Government and the Taoiseach to introduce the Reach project over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The position in the US, where there is too much flexibility, is stifling innovation particularly in areas of e-commerce by granting patents too liberally. This means people are facing barriers when they want to develop a new product or implement a new service because of all the patenting bureaucracy they have to go through. The decision by the EU in relation to this matter will be of fundamental importance to the development of ecommerce within the EU and Ireland. One of our key strategic goals is to develop <Col N="298" /> Ireland as the e-commerce hub of the European Union. It is important to ensure that case is made within the EU to ensure we do not go the route of the United States, especially in the area of software, where there is already a protection under the copyright Act. Given that it is already protected under the copyright Act why the need for this additional tier of bureaucracy, which will stifle innovation, as happened in the United States? A number of reports have been published which highlight the fact that research and development in the whole area of software has fallen since the new patenting regime came into force in the US. We should seriously consider going down that route before taking a decision. Perhaps the Minister will outline the Government's views on this matter and the position it will take within the European Union in relation to software patenting to protect the future viability of e-commerce here.</P>
    <P>To give an example of how far the US has gone, a new method of booking an hotel bedroom over the Internet has been patented. The US has gone to extremes. If we were to go down this avenue in the EU not only would it make the whole situation farcical and hinder the development of e-commerce, it would be a bureaucratic nightmare for the Patents Office to have to deal with all these Mickey Mouse patent applications and would seriously damage the efficiency of that office.</P>
    <P>I understand that additional patenting legislation will come before the House in the next couple of months. In a parliamentary reply on 3 October the Minister pointed out that there needs to be a revision of the European Patents Convention. Is it his intention to amend this legislation on Committee Stage or to introduce an additional Bill? It is important that we have a thorough look at any new additional amendments he may introduce rather than introduce large new sections of legislation on Committee Stage, which is unfair on members of the committee and those who debate these issues on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 enables the wording of paragraph (f2&gt;a) of section 10 of the Principal Act concerning exclusion from patentability of inventions whose exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality to be brought into line with Article 27.2 of the TRIPs Agreement.</P>
    <P>Public order or morality is one of the fundamental issues that need to be resolved in the whole issue of patenting. The headline of an article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 9 July 2000, read: &ldquo;Iceland's £100 million DNA sale has Irish implications&rdquo;. The article mentions that Ireland has decided to sell its rights to their citizens' DNA to a commercial firm for approximately £100 million. Most Members or the majority of the general public would not be aware of this but some people in the scientific community would be conscious of the fact that a huge proportion of Icelandic genes are the same as Irish genes. Basically, the Icelandic Government has sold the vast majority of the genes of the Irish population <Col N="299" /> to a commercial company for £100 million. This is a fundamental issue relating to the whole issue of why and how genes should be patented. It is a fundamental issue as to why Iceland or any other country can sell its DNA pool to major multinational companies. A huge debate needs to be opened up in this area. As we map human genes additional genes will continually be patented. As Deputy Upton said, the large biotechnology companies are running to patents offices to register genes. It will stifle development in this whole area, including the use of gene therapy and the treatment of genetic disorders. Yet we seem unwilling to debate the issue and are willing to turn our backs on it. Genes should not be patented. A gene is not an invention as it has existed for thousands of years. However, because multinational companies decide this is the way to go everyone will have to go to such companies. We have failed to address the issue and this legislation does not do so either. There is a need for a thorough debate in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for legislation because, as the human genome project is completed over the next two to three years, many more genes will be registered and patented. This will cause significant problems over the next ten to 20 years while these patents last. To the best of my knowledge most patents last up to 20 years. This will mean that, over the next 20 years, medical research and developments will be in the hands of a few large multinational companies and other research facilities will not have access to or permission to use these genes.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that any country can sell its DNA and gene pools to a multinational company. This development has major implications for Ireland because of the gene pool involved, our historic connection with Iceland and the impact this will have on the treatment of disorders which are specific to or more prevalent in countries such as Ireland and Iceland. The Minister of State needs to examine this issue and it is fundamentally important that we introduce legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Legislation is important, not only for future medial developments, but also because of the ethical problems which will arise. There was much discussion this summer concerning the Adam Nash case which opened up the debate in the area of patenting human life and the use of human genome technology and research. Senator Henry unsuccessfully attempted to introduce legislation in the Seanad in this area. An interdepartmental committee is examining biotechnology and these issues need to be addressed. Legislation must be brought forward and Ireland must be to the fore in leading ethical opinion rather than the current situation where we are dragging our heels and waiting for the EU and the US to make decisions. The US, in particular, is dictating the way forward to the EU and other countries.</P>
    <P>We are also failing to even consider the impact of these issues on the future development of the <Col N="300" /> Third World's biotechnological capabilities. Fundamental questions need to be addressed and we must have a thorough and frank debate. I ask the Minister of State to examine the science and technology recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science. The way to proceed in this area is by way of an Oireachtas committee. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate which goes back over seven months. I am conscious of the fact that this is a technical Bill. I agree with Opposition Deputies who stated that this should not be a contentious Bill as it is necessary legislation. However, valid points were raised, some of which are not specific to this Bill but are connected to it.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done in the area of intellectual property in the past few years. There was a reference to the Copyright Act which was a long drawn out process. I wish Deputies Naughten and Upton well in their new portfolios. My ministry covers trade, labour and consumer affairs and the Government has done much work in the area of intellectual property. The unit in the Department has been expanded and the Patents Office has moved to Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>There have been many positive recent developments. However, there have also been delays which have been acknowledged on this side of the House. We are dealing with important legislation, some of which will go over many people's heads, but it is important to pursue this issue and debate is important to that process.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte stated that he will table amendments on Committee Stage but the overall response to the Bill has been positive. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, opened the debate on the Bill because I was out of the country. Deputy Rabbitte quoted a passage from the speech of the Minister of State regarding proposed amendments to the existing provisions on compulsory licences. That passage tried to show that some of the existing grounds in Irish patent law on which a compulsory licence could be sought, which include, in particular, that the demand for a patented product in this country was being met by imports, are contrary to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPs.</P>
      <P>TRIPs provides that patent rights shall be enjoyed without discrimination as to, <i>inter alia</i>, whether patented products are imported or locally produced. We then indicated that, under the amendment proposed, if a patented product is produced in any WTO country and is subsequently imported to another country in amounts sufficient to satisfy local demand, it would not be possible to obtain a compulsory licence in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also inquired about the delay in bringing this measure forward when it was supposed to be enacted over three years ago. The <Col N="301" /> delay arose because work on the measure began at a time when matters relating to patent policy and legislation were in the process of transferring from the Patents Office to the intellectual property unit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Staff resources for dealing with patent matters within the intellectual property unit were constrained at the time, which I have already acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it initially appeared that it would be possible to transpose the patent provisions of TRIPs into Irish law by way of a statutory instrument and the measure was first prepared in that format. The Attorney General's office subsequently took the view that the measure would have to be in the form of primary legislation and work proceeded on that format immediately. These are the reasons for the delay in introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Creed asked for the justification for the exemption from patent protection of inventions concerning diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans. Irish legislation exactly reflects the requirements of the European patent convention. The policy behind the exclusion of such methods from patent protection is to ensure that those who use such methods as part of the medical treatment of humans or the veterinary treatment of animals should not be inhibited or restricted in their work by patents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a number of Deputies referred to the issue of gene technology and the patenting of biotechnological inventions. On the comments of Deputies Creed, Naughten and Upton, the human genome project is not capable of being patented. Patenting of bio-technological inventions is based on a Community directive which Ireland has recently implemented. Deputies Naughten and Upton have referred extensively to this area and I agree with them that it is an area which needs very detailed discussion. During my period as Minister of State, I have been conscious that I am coming to this at the end of a lengthy process of debate not just at European ministerial council level but at European Parliament level, as the Deputies would be aware. I am referring here to the directive on the patenting of bio-technological inventions. It has been contentious and has warranted very careful debate. I have represented at EU level, the kind of concerns which have been expressed here. Rightly there were references to the fact that new cures would be widely available. Everybody recognises the huge potential for cures, particularly for AIDS and other diseases, which result from the patenting of these bio-technological inventions but it is important that they be widely available. The debate has been going on for several years. It began under the last Government with extensive debate at political level and at official level, but I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for a wider debate on this subject. The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is that we have endeavoured to get the right balance at EU level. I have endeavoured to reflect <Col N="302" /> the views to which the Deputies referred here. It is equally important that the public and the NGOs, which are quite active in this area and with which I have tried to liaise, would be involved as much as possible in this debate. It is important to point out that we have always worked very closely with our EU colleagues and any developments in this area are conducted firmly under the umbrella of EU legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton also referred to other issues regarding initiatives at EU level. There have been several initiatives at EU level to reduce the cost of patenting, focusing especially on the cost of translation of patent specification.</P>
    <P>On the question of patenting software-related inventions, to which Deputy Naughten also referred, the EU Commission has launched a consultation process with interested parties in Europe. This process will be completed before Christmas and the Commission will propose measures based on the outcome of that process. At present it is possible to patent software-related inventions provided they comply with the general criteria for patenting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte sought information on the submissions made to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment by the Association of Patent and Trademark Agents. The association has made submissions covering the matters it wished to have dealt with in the Bill. I have included some, but not all, of these matters in the Bill. The association has, in effect, asked the Government to reconsider its position on those matters which have not been included and we have replied to it. While none of the extra amendments proposed by the association are controversial or complex, I concluded that it would not be timely to provide for them now.</P>
    <P>Apart from Deputy Rabbitte's comments on the substantive part of the Bill, other Deputies made points of a more general nature. Deputies Stanton, Rabbitte and Creed raised the matter of resources &ndash; this has come up on a number of occasions &ndash; for both the intellectual property unit and the Patents Office, especially in the context of the extra work requirements flowing from the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, which has now been enacted. The Government is satisfied that the Patents Office is sufficiently well staffed for the demand being made of it now and we will ensure that any further net new demands will be met by a well-staffed technologically up-to-date office.</P>
    <P>I am especially pleased at the way the Patents Office has bedded down in Kilkenny in such a short space of time and I acknowledge the effort made by all the staff, most of whom had not worked in the patents area before taking up office in Kilkenny. While this is an especially busy time on all fronts for the intellectual property unit of the Department, the Government is satisfied that the unit is sufficiently well staffed to meet the demands being made. However, I stress that this areas is being continually reviewed. I am conscious, as the Deputies have said, that this is a vibrant area and the agenda continues to move on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Deputies Stanton, Perry and Naughten mentioned the importance of the small inventor, whether in the form of an SME or an individual person. In that connection, the Deputies also raised the importance of widespread dissemination of information on the patenting process. It is a valid point, to which thought is being given at EU level. The EU Commission has indicated its intention, as part of its programme to advance innovation, to act in this front and it will in due course issue a communication on the subject of better dissemination of information among inventors, researchers and SMEs. On Deputy Naughten's suggestion that we examine carefully what was said at the recent committee meeting on Tuesday, I will ask my officials to look at the reports of that debate. I watched some of that debate on the television in my office and I feel it is important that we listen to what was said.</P>
    <P>On patents search, which was raised by Deputy Naughten, it is possible at present to carry out a search of patent documents in the Patents Office. Many of these documents are available on CD-ROM.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten also raised the revision of the European Patents Convention. A diplomatic conference to reverse the European Patents Convention will be held in Munich from 20-29 November. Our legislation will need further amendment as a consequence of changes which will be effected in the European Patents Convention following this diplomatic conference. The question of amending this Bill to incorporate the necessary change is under consideration.</P>
    <P>I hope I have addressed most, if not all, the points made by the Deputies in the course of the Second Stage debate. I will obviously be able to deal on Committee Stage with any areas I did not cover. I again thank the Deputies for their contributions. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will amend the Health Act, 1970, the Tobacco <Col N="304" /> (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, and the Health (Nursing Homes Act), 1990. This composite Bill sets out the Government's proposals: to improve and update the statutory basis for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and community drugs schemes; to raise the age at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons from the present age of sixteen years to eighteen years and to raise the maximum fine on persons convicted for selling tobacco products to under age persons from £500 to £1,500; and to empower the Minister for Health and Children to prescribe any necessary administrative and technical details to facilitate the efficient administration of the scheme for the payment of subvention in respect of patients in nursing homes, and also to empower the Minister to make regulations governing standards in private convalescent homes under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. As this is a composite Bill with three distinct elements, I propose to speak about each of these elements in turn and then to outline the contents of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>Section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is the statutory basis for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and the community drugs schemes, the schemes which allow the reimbursement by the State of medicines taken by patients in the community. It is generally accepted &ndash; this point came through in the debate on the Bill in the Seanad &ndash; that the original legislation was very good. However, this legislation is 30 years old and we are now dealing with increasingly complex pharmaceutical issues in this millennium which could not have been foreseen when the Health Act, 1970, was drafted.</P>
    <P>The Minister's purpose in amending section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is threefold. The proposals before the House in this Bill are made with a view to: improving and updating the regulation of the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and community drugs schemes; promoting an equitable and more accountable service in this regard; and better providing for the delivery of community pharmacy services.</P>
    <P>Under present arrangements, drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances are supplied without charge to persons with full eligibility, that is, medical card holders, under the general medical services scheme in line with criteria for reimbursement. Generally speaking, these items are provided through community pharmacies.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, where a general practitioner has a centre of practice three miles or more from the nearest community pharmacy, the doctor dispenses for those patients served from that centre who opt to have their medicines dispensed by him or her. In these circumstances, the general practitioner is known as a &ldquo;dispensing doctor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the provision of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for persons with limited eligibility &ndash;<Col N="305" /> non-medical card holders &ndash; is that community drugs schemes have been in operation over the years whereby the State meets a proportion of the cost of prescribed products. Under the current scheme, the drug payment scheme, an individual or family pays the first £42 in respect of expenditure on approved prescribed drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances and the balance of the cost is met by the State. I stress that a fundamental aspect of a scheme such as the drug payment scheme is that it is not means tested and is open to everyone.</P>
    <P>A third arrangement, known as the long-term illness scheme, is in place for persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature whereby drugs are made available without charge in respect of the treatment of the primary condition.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will continue present arrangements. Drugs continue to be supplied without charge to persons with full eligibility. Expenditure incurred by persons with limited eligibility in respect of themselves or their spouse or a dependent member of their family will continue to be recouped in part. In this regard, a dependent member of the family is defined as a child under the age of 18 years or under 23 years, if in full-time education, or a child of any age with a mental or physical disability to the extent that it is not reasonably possible for the child to maintain himself or herself fully and who is living at home. The Bill also continues to provide for the long-term illness scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister's concerns, which I share, are to ensure that arrangements for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances in the community are equitable, that all arrangements meet accountability requirements and that the service to patients is a quality service.</P>
    <P>Section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, as it stands, does not facilitate a clear and transparent approach to reimbursement, does not explicitly provide for accountability and is not adequately structured to promote a quality driven community pharmacy service. Expectations in this regard have changed since 1970 and steps must therefore be taken to bring the legislation into line with current demands and requirements.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for making regulations concerning the granting of approval of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for reimbursement purposes and the withdrawal of this approval for stated reasons. This will ensure an equitable, transparent and coherent approach to reimbursement. The Minister is also concerned to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility in how the State responds to the potential pharmaceutical needs of a patient. In some cases, it may not be appropriate to make a product universally reimbursable. For example, an over the counter product with a very wide application may be used by the general public in circumstances that do not warrant the use of the product from a clinical point of view &ndash; in other words, its use may not be necessary. If such a product is universally <Col N="306" /> reimbursable, a consequent waste of taxpayers' money is inevitable. However, that same product may be of therapeutic necessity for patients with particular conditions and it is important to provide the flexibility to reimburse such products in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is concerned with the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances in the community. The Bill, therefore, provides for the supply of reimbursable products through community pharmacies as the most appropriate dispensing arrangement in most instances for medicines taken in the community. This reflects current practice and policy in the provision of community pharmaceutical care in line with the contractor agreement for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which was introduced in 1996 and which is pro-active in promoting a quality driven service to the patient.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient, including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. In addition, the contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Bill makes specific provision for the making of regulations, designed to foster the best possible community pharmacy service in regard to agreements between the proprietor of a community pharmacy and a health board pursuant to which community pharmacies supply drugs and medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and community drugs schemes.</P>
    <P>However, in terms of supply and value for money &ndash; and, in some cases, patient convenience &ndash; it is recognised that community pharmacies may not be the most appropriate source of some non drug items and that expertise in this area may lie elsewhere. On this basis, the Bill will also allow the reimbursement of some non drug items supplied through other outlets approved by the Minister in accordance with regulations. The Bill also takes account of the fact that some medical card patients in remote areas will rely on their general practitioners, dispensing doctors, for the supply of medicines.</P>
    <P>The general medical services and community drugs schemes are fundamentally concerned with <Col N="307" /> medicines prescribed, dispensed and taken in the community under the supervision of a general practitioner. However, the provisions of the Bill acknowledge the dramatic pharmaceutical advancements of recent years which are likely to continue, perhaps at an even faster pace. In some circumstances, while the patient remains in the community, it may be appropriate for patient safety and monitoring purposes for certain sophisticated drugs to be dispensed in a hospital or clinic setting on an out patient basis. The Bill, therefore, provides for the reimbursement of products provided by an institution that provides a specialist service under the direct supervision of a medical consultant, where approved by the Minister in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of value for money and accountability, the Bill will empower the Minister to make regulations to provide for the manner in which payments to community pharmacists and others who supply items under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, are made by the relevant State agencies with responsibility in this matter and for the furnishing of information on items supplied, services provided and the costs involved. Regulations may also be made for the furnishing of information that the relevant State agencies may require by suppliers of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to those dispensing these products. The Bill, therefore, provides a good legislative basis for verification of claims on the State by those supplying products reimbursable by the State.</P>
    <P>I will return to the amendment of section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, when outlining the contents of the Bill but will move on now to the amendment of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988. The Minister and I regard the battle against smoking as one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium and this area is one of the Minister's main priorities as Minister for Health and Children. The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on public health is enormous. Tobacco related illnesses kill half of those who use tobacco. Tobacco is a significant burden to individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. It is estimated that smoking related illnesses account for about 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland. There are a number of diseases such as lung cancer, emphysema and heart disease associated with tobacco consumption. Within the European Union, the tobacco epidemic is killing more than half a million citizens each year.</P>
    <P>There is particular cause for concern over the reported increase in the level of smoking among children and teenagers. One of the most disturbing facts about smoking is that for the majority of smokers the addiction begins in their childhood or teenage years. In this context, the Minister launched a new multi-media anti-smoking advertising campaign for young females on 10 October as part of our new Ireland Needs a <Col N="308" /> Change of Heart Initiative. The sale of tobacco products to children and underage persons in particular is a most reprehensible practice and is one that has to be tackled aggressively. The report Towards a Tobacco Free Society launched by the Minister on 7 March this year recommends, among other things, raising the age limit at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons to 18 years, as does the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on Smoking and Health published in November 1999.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 before the House today will have the effect of raising the age at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons from 16 to 18 years and will raise the maximum fine on persons convicted for selling to underage persons from £500 to £1,500. The increase in the maximum fine to £1,500 is the highest amount that can be included in this type of amendment and will act as a further deterrent to retailers. Work is under way in my Department to prepare a new comprehensive tobacco Bill which will take on board many of the other proposals recommended in the report Towards a Tobacco Free Society.</P>
    <P>Tobacco advertising plays an important role in promoting tobacco products particularly in relation to young people. A complete ban on all forms of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products is necessary if we are to reduce children's exposure to inducements to tobacco products. The House will be aware that the Minister advised the tobacco industry here that no further advertising or sponsorship, other than limited retail and trade advertising, would be allowed after 1 July 2000. With regard to an overspill of UK newspapers, magazines and other foreign publications here, new regulations were introduced on 11 July last to prohibit or restrict the importation for sale of newspapers, magazines or publications containing tobacco advertising. My concerns in this area are the promotion and protection of public health and children and the elimination of childhood addiction to tobacco. I have no apologies to make to anyone for introducing the ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship.</P>
    <P>Ireland has for many years been a leading advocate for world-wide control and ultimate elimination of tobacco use from society. We were one of the first countries to introduce restrictions on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the industry. These measures were later adapted for the whole of the European Union and are now the gold standard internationally. We are also one of the first countries to recognise the impact of environmental tobacco smoke and to introduce prohibitions on smoking in public places. This is a proud tradition of world leadership and we are determined that Ireland will continue in this role.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 3 of the Bill which amends the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high <Col N="309" /> standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act. The second is to provide a system of subventions for dependent persons in need of nursing home care.</P>
    <P>With regard to subventions, section 7(2) of the Act provides that the Minister may by regulations prescribe the amounts of subvention that may be paid. Such amounts may be specified by reference to specified degrees of dependency, means or circumstances of dependent persons or such other matters as the Minister considers appropriate. The rates of subvention were duly fixed by the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993. To facilitate the operation of the subvention scheme, provisions relating to the administration of the scheme are required. These provisions would cover such areas as making of applications for subvention; onus on applicant to furnish information; assessment of degree of dependency; assessment of means and circumstances; calculation of amounts payable; notification of decision on applicants; review of subventions decision; death or discharge of patient; services to be covered by subvention; appeals against decisions and recoupment of subventions. It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 7(2) to provide the powers to prescribe any necessary administrative and technical details.</P>
    <P>In addition, a further amendment of the Act is required to take account of the introduction by the Minister for Finance of a scheme of tax allowances in respect of capital expenditure on private convalescent homes in the Finance Act, 1999. The allowances apply to expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a convalescent home as well as the conversion of an existing building into a convalescent home. To ensure the standard of care in convalescent homes is satisfactory, it is proposed that such homes be required to be registered under the Nursing Homes Act.</P>
    <P>Regulations have been made under section 6 of the Act for the purpose of ensuring proper standards in nursing homes. It will be necessary to make similar regulations governing standards in convalescent homes, which may include provisions requiring convalescent homes to have adequate medical, nursing and para-medical staff and facilities consistent with the patient profile of the home. It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 6 of the Act to give ministerial power to prescribe different requirements for such homes.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to outline the contents of the Bill. Section 1 amends section 59 of the Health Act, 1970 by the substitution of a new section for the existing section. Subsections (1), (2) and (3) provide for the supply of approved, prescribed, drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with full eligibility and people with limited eligibility and their dependants. Subsection (4) provides for the supply of approved, prescribed medicines to medical card holders by dispensing doctors and for the supply of non drug items to people with full eligibility and limited eligibility by other persons, as <Col N="310" /> approved by the Minister. Subsection (5) provides for the supply of approved, prescribed drugs by an institution that provides a specialist service under the direct supervision of a medical consultant and stands approved by the Minister. Subsection (6) provides for the making of regulations specifying the terms and conditions upon which, and the extent to which, health boards may defray the cost of supplying a particular drug or drugs, or drugs for the treatment of a particular condition or conditions. Subsection (7) provides for the granting of an approval by the Minister for the purposes of the previous subsections and for the withdrawal of an approval for stated reasons and in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) is a standard provision to the effect that the Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section. Subsection (9) provides that regulations may provide for the manner in which payments may be made in respect of drugs supplied by community pharmacies and persons referred to in subsections (4) and (5) and in respect of fees for services. The regulations may also provide for the furnishing of information required on drugs supplied and services provided and for the refusal of payment if a request for information is not complied with. Subsection (10) provides for regulations on agreements between the proprietor of pharmacies and health boards pursuant to which community pharmacies supply drugs for the purpose of this section. Subsection (11) provides that where a supplier of drugs to community pharmacies fails or refuses to comply with a request under regulations, the supplier shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the report of the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Children following his enquiries into three clinical trials involving residents in children's homes, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 9th November, 2000, be referred to the Joint Com<Col N="311" /> mittee on Health and Children for its consideration.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the interest of Members in the report of the chief medical officer. There are two clear issues. The first is the model of subsequent investigation which should take place into the report and the second is the legalities for rounding the powers the Laffoy commission has or may seek, to deal further with the issue.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe the Laffoy commission is the best vehicle for the further examination and investigation of this issue. I made that point to the House last week. There is a clear synergie between what the Laffoy commission is currently engaged in and this issue. A strong research team has been built up as well as a secretariat and legal infrastructure. A raft of preparatory work has been undertaken which will be conducive to dealing expeditiously with the issue.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to infer, as has been done, that to refer the matter to a commission which was established by the Oireachtas is an attempt to long-finger or bury the matter. My motivation in sending the matter to the Laffoy commission is to make absolutely sure it can be thoroughly and comprehensively dealt with and that no one, least of all the Department, any of its agents, or any of the agencies or health boards which may or may not have been involved, can avoid being questioned about the issue. The suggestion that sending the matter to the Laffoy commission lets someone off the hook defies logic. The commission is a statutorily based inquiry with the capacity to summon health boards or the Department of Health and Children if that is deemed necessary. It is the better model in this instance. The institution was established by the Oireachtas. It is wrong to suggest that people are being devious and I take issue with that suggestion. My motivation is to get to the truth and the Laffoy commission is a guarantee that the truth will be found. It has the capacity to search for the truth and to establish it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has queried the legality of referring the issues raised in the report to the Laffoy commission. I appreciate the good faith of the Labour Party and I accept that its amendment was intended to be helpful. The advice of the Attorney General on this matter was stated to the House by the Taoiseach earlier this morning.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's advice is that the definition of abuse in the Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse Act, 2000, includes any wilful infliction of physical injury or failure to prevent such injury to a child and any failure to care for a child or act or omission towards a child which has serious adverse effects on the child's behaviour or welfare.</P>
    <P>In so far as clinical trials are alleged to have been conducted without the appropriate consent and in so far as these trials are alleged to include the use of injections and internasal administration of drugs, quite clearly an issue arises as to whether any such trials amounted in law to an <Col N="312" /> assault or an unlawful invasion of the physical integrity of the children involved. Likewise the consequences of participating in any such trials are matters that relate to the welfare of children. All these issues fall within the scope of the commission as expressed in section 1 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by Deputy McManus that acts must be proved to amount to abuse and to have affected the welfare of a child before the commission can inquire into them is erroneous. The wording of the Act, and particularly section 4(1)<i>(b) </i>makes it clear that one of the functions of the commission is to establish whether acts capable of amounting to abuse actually occurred, whether, as a matter of fact, such acts amounted to abuse and what the effect of them was on the children concerned. That is the advice the Government has received.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has also been informed that the Laffoy commission proposes to consider the issues raised by the report as a separate heading within its inquiry and that the commission is considering whether any order under section 4(4) is necessary or appropriate to assist the commission in this respect. It is the Government's intention to consult fully with the commission on that issue, as is envisaged by the Act, and to make any necessary order under section 4(4). If any such order is made it will, of course, require the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>The Laffoy commission offers a comprehensive vehicle for dealing expeditiously and rigorously with the totality of the issues involved. The Government motion proposes to refer the report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children for its consideration. The joint committee may wish to raise other issues. That is a matter for the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;its consideration&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;investigation, especially, into the role of the Department of Health and Children in authorising or approving vaccine tests on children in institutions and what connection, if any, exists between these tests and a batch of vaccine used in 1968 to 1970 which was manufactured by the same company and which caused adverse reactions, including brain damage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I play the role of counsel for the prosecution. The Minister should not be surprised that I question him or his Department or raise issues which are in the public interest. I have always operated within decent standards as Opposition spokesman. However, when I smell a rat I call &ldquo;foul smell&rdquo; and I do not care if that upsets the Minister's nice guy appearance. I smell a rat in this case. The Constitution requires the Minister and his Department to account to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has not been handled properly. The Minister wanted this motion to be referred without debate. He did not want the statements <Col N="313" /> last week referring the matter to the Laffoy commission or this morning's debate. He put this issue on the long finger throughout the summer when the joint committee was led to believe the report would be referred to it, not for consideration but for investigation.</P>
    <P>It should not be left to the Minister, his Department or any of his predecessors who have questions to answer to decide where the report should go for investigation although I accept the referral of the report to the Laffoy commission is a <i>fait accompli.</i>The role of the Department of Health and Children needs to be examined. An expert group was established by the then Minister for Health in 1977 to examine persons who it was claimed had been permanently damaged by the whooping cough vaccination in the 1960s and 1970s. That group found that in 16 of the 93 cases presented to it there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible. An <i>ex gratia </i>payment of a paltry £10,000 was offered to each of the 16, and 15 took the payment. In 1992, the Supreme Court found in favour of the sixteenth, Kenneth Best. The vaccine was administered to at least 143 children in 1968 and 1969, according to research I have seen.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because there must be a reasonable suspicion that there may be a connection between the bad batch of whooping cough vaccination and the reaction to it by so many children and the trial tests subsequently carried out on children, particularly children in institutions, to which the report the Minister has referred to refers.</P>
    <P>Is it coincidental that the children in the 1960s and 1970s fell foul of vaccine manufactured by Welcome, the same company which tested other vaccines &ndash; without lawful authority, according to the implication of the Minister's report to the House &ndash; on children, some of whom were in institutions and whose parents were not in a position to give consent?</P>
    <P>That issue has been referred to the Laffoy commission and I can do nothing about that. However, the Minister and his Department have questions to answer on that to Dáil Éireann. Why should the Minister, who has those questions to answer, be the person to decide where it should go? That would be similar to an accused before a court&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department have questions to answer. It would be similar to an accused before a court determining how the jury should be made up. Therefore, my amendment seeks the deletion of the words &ldquo;its consideration&rdquo; and the substitution of:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>investigation, especially, into the role of the Department of Health and Children in authorising or approving vaccine tests on children in institutions and what connection, if any, exists <Col N="314" /> between these tests and the batch of vaccine used in 1968 to 1970 which was manufactured by the same company and which caused adverse reactions, including brain damage.</P>
    <P>This would ensure the matter was sent to the Joint Committee on Health and Children for investigation.</P>
    <P>This issue is separate from any issue of abuse that the Minister may have referred to the Laffoy commission. It is of relevance to the House and if there is any shade of doubt, the Minister should make a statement on it and answer questions about the role of his Department. His Department should not decide to where the report should be referred. It should account to the House for its actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The vaccine trials apparently are to be referred to the Laffoy commission on the grounds that they involve the deliberate reckless and negligent infliction of personal injury. The only question that arises is whether a person asked to appear as a witness before or otherwise to co-operate with the commission might have an argument for refusing to co-operate on the grounds that these trials and the issues arising from the way in which they were organised did not involve the infliction of personal injury at all on any reasonable interpretation of that act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's argument appears to be that the use of a syringe to inject the vaccine means that technically an injury was inflicted and, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Laffoy commission can be invoked. There are two separate legal concepts if one wants to treat this as a technical issue of statutory interpretation. First, lack of consent or a lack of valid consent to an injection would, technically speaking, make the administration of that injection an assault and the victim of that assault could sue for damages. However, the Laffoy commission's jurisdiction <Col N="315" /> does not turn on the question of whether a technical assault or any civil wrong was committed.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the commission turns on the question of whether a personal injury was inflicted. Since it appears to be agreed that the contents of the syringe, the trial vaccine itself, did not cause any personal injury, the Government's argument gets even narrower. It is claimed that the process of injection by a syringe involves inflicting a personal injury. This appears to involve a confusion about the meaning of words; not every act of assault amounts to the infliction of an injury. In ordinary English, an injury must, by definition, be injurious. Either a child suffered a personal injury or it did not.</P>
    <P>Lack of consent does not make the small red mark on its arm a personal injury deliberately inflicted. The fact that it did not consent to the contents of this particular syringe being injected into its system does not make the mark around the pin prick on its skin, a mark it would have for a few days no matter what was in the syringe, any more a personal injury deliberately inflicted than it would be in the case of all the children who received the three in one vaccine in the normal course of events. Either all children suffer personal injury when they are vaccinated or these children did not suffer personal injury.</P>
    <P>The issue of consent is not relevant to the question of whether the consequences of an assault are physically injurious. Having regard to the purposes for which the Laffoy commission was set up, the individuals to whom its enabling statute is addressed and its relatively non-technical language, it is straining that language beyond breaking point to claim that an issue involving much wider questions of consent and of medical ethical propriety can be investigated by it only because of the entirely fortuitous circumstance that the vaccine trials at issue involved a vaccine administered in a syringe and not a lump of sugar.</P>
    <P>This important point has not been addressed by the Government. The Attorney General must take a fresh look at the matter. I hope it is not the case that personal pride is preventing the Minister from seeing the important and serious legal argument being made by the Labour Party in this regard. To avoid argument in the future, the issue needs to be put beyond doubt. That is all we are seeking. It can be easily done. We provided the Government with suitable wording for an order that can be made. It is not a difficult process.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that this matter is investigated fully, independently and properly with all the resources of the Laffoy commission. I do not have the same confidence in Deputy Mitchell that he appears to have in himself.</P>

      <P>There is an apparatus that is capable of dealing with this issue, but the Government must ensure that, legally, it can carry out the work with which it is being charged.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to have a second look at this matter because the substance of our argument and our concerns have not been taken on board in an open manner. The Minister presents himself as having an open view on this issue, but that is not the response we are getting. I suspect the Attorney General may be taking a view that is different from the correct view in terms of making certain that the objective which we all share of having this matter fully investigated is achieved. If, ultimately, this is prevented because of a failure by the Government to fully address the legal questions, the Minister will not be allowed to forget it. It is a most important matter and it is in the Minister's hands.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell. Too many things were hidden in Ireland for too long. This is probably the most serious case that has ever arisen. For too long matters were hidden and what happened in the past should never happen again. Regardless of who must answer them, questions must be answered in this Parliament. The Committee of Public Accounts did an excellent job on another investigation and there is no reason the Joint Committee on Health and Children could not hold a similar investigation. This should be done. If necessary, people should be brought in and questioned and if their answers need to be questioned, that should be done. There is no reason that should not happen.</P>
      <P>What happened to these children is probably the greatest outrage that ever took place in Ireland. However, the country has not changed much. It is still the case that matters are brushed under the carpet or hidden behind the curtains. The idea is that matters should not be made known and that the people involved must be protected. However, guilty people in this case, regardless of who or what they are, should not be protected. They should be brought before the courts and the committee and they should answer whatever questions are put to them.</P>
      <P>For too long too many people in this country have been protected and innocent people have been hurt. The children in this case had nobody to fight for them or speak on their behalf. They had no representatives but at least the world is more modern now and people can ask questions on their behalf of the individuals who were supposed to look after them but failed to do so. The children were used by a company for drug trials and nobody knew the possible effects of the drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter needs to be investigated and this should be done by a committee of the House rather than the Laffoy commission. We should ask the questions and get the answers. The people <Col N="317" /> found wanting, regardless of whether they are in the Department of Health and Children, should not be protected. The people involved and the matter should be dealt with openly in the public domain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (11) provides that where a supplier of drugs to community pharmacies fails or refuses to comply with a request under regulations, the supplier shall be guilty of an offence and liable to summary conviction or a fine not exceeding £1,500. Section 12(1) is a standard subsection defining words or phrases in the section and section 12(2) is a standard provision for regulations made under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970. Section 2 amends the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, by substituting a new section for section 3 of that Act to raise the age at which tobacco products may be sold to young persons from 16 years to 18 years and to raise the maximum fine on persons convicted of selling tobacco products to under age persons from £500 to £1,500. It also provides that it shall be a defence for a person who is prosecuted for an offence under this section to establish that he or she had not taken all reasonable steps to assure himself or herself that the person to whom the tobacco products were sold, offered for sale or made available had attained the age of 18 years.</P>
      <P>Section 3 amends the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, by the insertion of a new subsection after subsection (6) of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, to provide for regulations to make different provisions for different classes of nursing homes and prescribe different requirements for different classes of nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 7 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, a new subsection is substituted for subsection (2) with regard to the making of regulations prescribing any necessary administrative and technical details in relation to the operation of the subvention scheme. Section 4 is a standard technical provision setting out the Title of the Bill and providing that it and the Health Acts, 1947 to 1999, may be cited together as the Health Acts, 1947 to 2000, and that the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection Act) 1988 and this Act may be cited together as the Tobacco (Health <Col N="318" /> Promotion and Protection) Acts, 1988 and 2000. It also provides for the making of orders with regard to the coming into operation of the provisions of the Bill. These are the provisions of the Bill. I have no doubt the House is committed to fair and transparent arrangements for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the Health Act, 1970, that the House welcomes appropriate anti-tobacco strategies in view of the effects of tobacco on the nation's health and that the House supports necessary changes in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. The Bill contains a range of measures with regard to its three distinct elements to strengthen existing legislation. Nevertheless, the Government is prepared to consider any amendments which Deputies may wish to put forward on Committee Stage with a view to bolstering the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>I intend on Committee Stage to move an amendment to this Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill on health issues to ensure that the composition of bodies appointed by the Minister for Health and Children will in future come before the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for ratification.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to move such an amendment given the Minister's reckless, self-serving and insensitive packing of the board of the Blood Transfusion Service. The Minister seems to believe he has the right to use the health services of the State and the resources voted by this House for those services to buttress his own electoral support in his Dáil constituency and to portray himself as a great man for Cork. Unfortunately in the poor judgment he has shown on this occasion, he has brought bad publicity and undeservedly so on Cork. He has also brought bad publicity to the hard-pressed Blood Transfusion Service at a time when it is already under scrutiny from the Lindsay inquiry and is not enjoying the same level of uncritical public support as it did in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recently filled six vacancies on the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Three of those appointed are Cork-based, the fourth is a UCC graduate, the fifth is from the Southern Health Board area and the sixth appointee is the former secretary general of Fianna Fáil. The board already had a Cork chairperson, another member from the Southern Health Board area and a representative of the Minister from the Department of Health and Children. The 12 member board now has five Cork members, plus a graduate from UCC, two other representatives from the Southern Health Board area, the Minister's personal representative from the Department of Health and Children and the former Secretary General of Fianna Fáil making up ten of the 12 members.</P>

      <P>There are two board members who are Dublin-based and none from the Western Health Board area, from where the Minister of State comes, none from the Midland Health Board area, none from the South Eastern Health Board area or the North Eastern Health Board area. At a time when the Minister should be leading public opinion towards renewed confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service, he has done the opposite by blatantly politicising and tribalising what is supposed to be an independent national service and he is doing so for his own political advantage. These self-serving actions are insensitive, improper and wholly unacceptable. The IBTS should take its decisions based on the health needs of the people and should do so independently. The agencies responsible for the advancement of the health of the people should not be turned into political agencies for the advancement of the Minister. I call on the Minister to publicly explain his actions and to account to the Dáil for his actions. Furthermore, I call for the dismissal of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and its re-composition in a fair, representative form. This service is such a sensitive one that for a Minister to show such poor judgment and to abuse his power by filling it in this way is absolutely outrageous. I call on the Minister to come to this House and explain his actions and I call on him to take the steps I outlined today.</P>
      <P>In relation to the tobacco provisions of this Bill, the House may be interested to hear the response of the Minister for Education and Science to Parliamentary Question No. 384 of 14 November 2000 that I tabled. I asked him if his attention had been drawn to newspaper reports that staff were assisting children in care in the purchase of cigarettes and if, in view of the decision to stop providing cigarettes to patients in mental hospitals, this practice will be discontinued. The reply I received is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board of Management and the Director of Trinity House School are responsible for the <Col N="320" /> day to day operation of the school and for ensuring that best practice in relation to cigarette smoking by young people and for ensuring that relevant legislation in this regard is complied with. Most young people admitted to Trinity House School have been smoking cigarettes for a number of years and consequently are already addicted to nicotine by the time they arrive at the school. The school's policy in this regard is to educate and support the boys to stop smoking. In cases where children do not succeed in giving up the habit, cigarettes are given to the children concerned to be smoked in a restricted way within the school. Young people who do not smoke in Trinity House or who give up smoking are rewarded positively.</P>
    <P>I understand the pressures on the Department and on Trinity House are such that they could have that policy. I do not suggest that they are negligent as they have a lot on their plate. However, the Minister is coming into the House like John Wayne, taking on the tobacco industry, raising the age to 18 and doing the devil and all but the Minister for Education and Science has a different policy in institutions under his own tutelage.</P>
    <P>There should be a policy in the Department to assist these children. Leaving aside the fact that they are addicted to nicotine and need a cigarette to keep calm, smoking is damaging their health just as it is damaging the health of those we are trying to protect by raising the age under the Bill. I am not making a meal out of it or condemning those in Trinity House but the policies of both Ministers must be reconciled in the interests of the health of those concerned.</P>
    <P>On 15 November in a question to the Minister for Health and Children I asked him if he would accept the recommendation of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children that the Statute of Limitations not be applied in the case of those who pursue the tobacco industry, such as a constituent, and I gave the details. The same Minister who is telling us here that he is so concerned about smoking and the damage it causes, stated:</P>
    <P>I have not reached any conclusions with regard to the recommendations regarding the statute of limitations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children report on smoking. I am advised there are possible legal and constitutional implications with regard to any alteration to the Statute of Limitations, 1957 and 1951.</P>
    <P>The author of that report is Deputy Shatter who is a leading solicitor. The committee accepted the report. The Minister stated in his reply that he had not reached any conclusions but he should do so, along the lines of the report.</P>
    <P>The tobacco industry here, just as in the United States, has many questions to answer. My father died from lung cancer when I was five, no doubt contributed to by the fact that he smoked Woodbines and a pipe. I declare my interest in that <Col N="321" /> regard. The tobacco industry is very powerful and must be called to account. It is deliberately targeting young people, girls in particular, to use its addictive product so that they will continue to buy it in adulthood, thereby perpetuating the profits of the industry.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics suggest that because young women in France have started to smoke in the same fashion as young women in Ireland, 25 years from now the average age of death in France will have dropped to what it is here. The Minister should bite the bullet and accept the recommendations. If the industry wishes to challenge him, let it do so. The Statute of Limitations should be amended to allow people take on the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to raise the age at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons from 16 to 18 years and to raise the fine imposed on those convicted of selling tobacco products to underage persons from £500 to £1,500. I welcome that. However, the Government seems to be suffering from a dual personality as regards tobacco and alcohol. It has extended pub opening hours, as if we did not have enough problems with alcohol, to ensure young people in Dublin can be out drinking until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. From where did the pressure come to extend drinking time in Dublin pubs? I am reliably informed by taxi drivers that many young people piling onto the streets in the early hours of the morning, even on mid-week mornings, are so incoherent they can barely give their address to the driver. What are the implications of this for unwanted teenage pregnancies, not to mention the general health of the young population?</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to get tough with the tobacco industry. That is the flavour of the day. Even smokers accept he has a case but I will take him more seriously when he acts in the same way with brewers, distillers and the advocates of late night pub opening who seem to have a special inside place in the current Administration. Guinness has an advertising slogan &ldquo;Live life to the power of Guinness&rdquo;. Recently it was accompanied by a series of advertisements suggesting that Guinness should be consumed on every occasion from a stag party to the hair of a dog. It is not only promoting a product but glamourising alcohol. Its advertising campaign has crossed the divide between the acceptability of occasional drinking to promoting virtual dependency. It has taken out full page advertisements.</P>
    <P>In a survey conducted by the Eastern Health Board last year, almost 80% of boys between 15 and 18 years stated they had an alcoholic drink at least every month. For girls in the same age group it was 65%. When the figures for those aged between 10 and 14 are included, the percentage is at a frighteningly high 51% of school boys and 38% of school girls, an average of 45% overall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville has often raised the issue of suicide. We have a chronic suicide rate among young people. What contribution does the depressing effects of alcohol make to this heart-<Col N="322" /> breaking phenomenon? Of course cigarettes damage the health of children. No one is more ardently in support of not just banning smoking but having a campaign to convince children that it destroys their health and that they are contributing to the profits of the industry, but what about the damage caused by alcohol about which we have no overall policy except to extend the opening hours of pubs without any campaign to deal with the effects of alcohol? There should be a Green Paper on alcohol abuse and the effects of alcohol. It is time we had a policy to counteract this consumption. One has only to look at the contribution alcohol makes to death rates from heart failure and related matters and to the number of people killed on the roads, about which we are constantly concerned. We do not have an overall philosophy or policy to deal with the abuse of alcohol. I call for a Green Paper to set out policy alternatives which we can refine into a White Paper on legislative and policy decisions. It is time we dealt with this matter comprehensively.</P>
    <P>Alcohol does more damage to individuals and families than all the banned drugs consumed here. Yet we permit ever increasing public inducements to consume alcohol, including attaching the Guinness product to the national game of hurling. The GAA should review its policy in this regard. The Guinness brewery is located in my constituency and it has been a good employer over the years. Its product is enjoyed by many people, in moderation. My criticism is not of the moderate consumption of products with an alcoholic content but of the policy of allowing these products to be advocated in an unhealthy way without being fettered or criticised.</P>
    <P>We have strong restrictions on the advertisement of tobacco, for example, but we have allowed Guinness to take over the national game of hurling and to run full page advertisements advocating alcohol in all circumstances, from improving the hair of the dog to examination results or whatever happens to be its marketing ploy on the day. That is wrong and if we are serious about addressing issues which affect young people, this matter should be included in the Bill. I intend to ask the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to take a closer look at this issue with a view to making up-to-date all-party recommendations to address it in a measured, reasoned and balanced manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring will deal with the nursing home provisions. I want to deal with the general medical services, the community drug schemes and improving and updating the statutory basis for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical appliances. Clause 9 of S.I. 152 of 1996 states, <i>inter alia</i>:</P>
    <P>(1) The Pharmacy contractor [that is, the pharmacist in the private sector, not the hospital pharmacist] shall prior to the dispensing of each prescription, and prior to the supply of the medicine, ensure that a pharmacist <Col N="323" /> reviews the medicine therapy of the individuals for whom the prescription is issued.</P>
    <P>(2) The review for sub-clause (1) shall include screening for any potential drug therapy problems, which may arise out of the use of the medicine(s) prescribed. The problems to be screened for shall include those which may be due to therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions (including serious interactions with non-prescription or over-the-counter medicines or foods), incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug-allergy interactions and clinical abuse and/or misuse.</P>
    <P>There are many other provisions contained in that.</P>
    <P>Few pharmacists fulfil the role provided for in that statutory instrument. If they did, they would have to do so in front of other people in the pharmacist's shop. Pharmacies are retail outlets. In addition to dealing with prescribed medicines, they also have a range of other products which people acquire, some of which are not directly related to medicine, such as manicure products. This statutory instrument also provides for restrictions on the licensing of additional pharmacists, so they were meant to give back something to the community. If someone wants advice from a pharmacist, they will not stand in front of a cash register to be advised about their personal medication needs in front of someone who is waiting to buy a nail file</P>
    <P>It is time we considered assisting pharmacists to make a consultation area available within a pharmacy so they have an opportunity to talk to clients about the drugs prescribed by their doctor. While it is not their job to second guess the doctor, they have a responsibility under Clause 9 to discuss their clients' health and to see if they are still taking the drugs prescribed. I understand that up to 50% of all drugs taken are not taken properly. Some people stop taking their drugs if they get a reaction without going back to their general practitioner. Perhaps if they told their pharmacist about the reaction, he or she could advise them by asking them if they are drinking alcohol or taking other medication at the same time. Clause 9 of S.I. 152 intended that to happen and I would like that to happen. If the Minister is serious about the provisions in the Bill, he will take steps to ensure it happens.</P>
    <P>I am saddened to see a Bill before us which does not mention the need to extend medical cards. If this Bill deals with the concerns of people in the community about their medication, how can we, as representative legislators and decent people, stand over a situation where a husband and wife, whose assessable income exceeds £135, do not qualify for a medical card? The figure is £167 for a husband and wife with two dependent children. That was not intended. While we have an agreement with the IMO that up to 40% of the population can be covered by <Col N="324" /> medical cards, it has fallen back to approximately three quarters of that.</P>
    <P>Poor people with children &ndash; figures show they die younger &ndash; cannot afford to go to their doctor or to the community pharmacy for which the Minister is providing in the Bill. When will we get that message across? The Fianna Fáil element of the Government has been in office since 1987, with the exception of two and a half years. It has lost touch with the difficulties faced by people on low incomes who cannot afford to go to their general practitioner or to buy medicines and who should have a medical card if their income exceeds £135 for a husband and wife or £95 for a single person. Some Members of this House would not go into a restaurant with £95 in their pocket. It is outrageous that we treat the citizens of a so-called Republic in this manner. I am sorry this Bill, which addresses the provisions of community drug schemes, does not take the opportunity to address that issue.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with standards in private convalescent homes under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, the health of children and medicines. However, it is about time the Minister became concerned about the state of hygiene in our public hospitals. It is easy to be concerned about private nursing homes but some of our public hospitals need attention. I would like the Minister to come into the House and make a statement on MRSA, the extent to which it is spreading in hospitals, why it continues to spread, what steps are being taken to deal with it and if hospital practices and hygiene are contributing to it. We are entitled to know that. Some people are being discharged from hospitals earlier because they have a better chance of survival at home than at the hospital, where they are likely to contract MRSA. We are entitled to be told in how many hospitals MRSA is prevalent and increasing. What are the plans to tackle it? I am very concerned about it.</P>
    <P>On the general question of hygiene, yesterday a colleague reminded me there was a time when if one visited a hospital run by nuns one could see a reflection of oneself on the floor. Today I understand if food served to a patient falls to the ground nurses must wait for contract cleaners to remove it. In some instances this has meant food being left on the ground for prolonged periods. By way of another example of the problem, I understand that a shower in a hospital is constructed in such a way that there is no guard at the entrance, that it is not wide enough to cater for wheelchairs and is not, therefore, intended for use by disabled people. The water flows on to the floor causing all kinds of smells and problems with the result that nurses must put towels across it while disabled or injured people are being showered. These issues should be reported on. Who is responsible for medical services if this is happening and when will the House receive a report on the state of hygiene in hospitals?</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Act should be followed where it provides for an inspection of mental <Col N="325" /> health services. An inspectorate of public hospitals should be established, perhaps under the aegis of the health boards, to ensure that the practices in hospitals are hygienic, that people can stay in hospital for as long as they require treatment and are not sent home because their domestic environment is medically safer. I do not know when the practice of sending patients home for this reason was started, but it is unacceptable. It is impossible to imagine a patient at, say, the Blackrock Clinic having to put up with the remains of custard or ice-cream on the floor. It would not happen. Why, therefore, should it happen to the Joe Soaps who attend public hospitals? There should be accountability to this House on the question of hygiene in hospitals and where there is a problem it should be addressed. We will only know the extent of the problem in this area when there is an independent inspectorate of public hospitals who can report on standards in them.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides the opportunity to deal with a number of issues of major concern, but instead it provides a number of tidying up provisions and duplicity in the area of tobacco. I will return to these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell's comments on the abuse of alcohol. It is the downside of the tiger economy that so many young people are abusing and being encouraged to abuse alcohol. Given the chronic damage that can and will be done as a result of this, we are storing up problems in the long-term with regard to the provision of health services. We need to address the issue.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party wants to support this Bill, especially its provisions on cigarette smoking, which are modest but welcome. However, we are dissatisfied with other aspects. These need to be amended.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains provisions to amend the Health (Nursing Homes) Act. Nursing homes play an important part in the overall provision of services to the elderly. That is recognised in the existence of the subvention system, which will be regularised by this legislation.</P>
      <P>For many elderly and frail people a nursing home provides a safe haven and a home from home. The regulations governing private nursing homes ensure that standards are maintained for those fortunate enough to access the care they need. This is progressive legislation in ensuring that standards are applied and maintained in private nursing homes. Before its enactment there were at times abuses, standards were not maintained and care for very vulnerable people was not properly provided. Demand for nursing homes is growing and demographic factors will ensure this will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a growing need for step-down facilities for patients who block beds in acute hospitals. Low-tech step-down facilities are not available. The pressure on acute hospitals, especially over the winter months, is not a new <Col N="326" /> phenomenon. Greater sickness and demand on A&amp;E departments in winter are to be expected. What is not, and should not be expected is the ineffectiveness of the Minister in dealing with this crisis, indeed ineffective is too kind a word.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor did nothing to address this problem. Like a hibernating animal he disappeared in the winter when the crisis was at its worst. The Minister has adopted a different approach. His response to the winter beds crisis was announced with the usual PR spin we associate with him. However, it is worse than a sham because it creates as many problems as it will solve.</P>
    <P>In his press release the Minster said an additional 500 nursing home places will be provided. However, he is not creating new spaces but commandeering existing beds within the scarce pool of existing nursing homes. When I asked him by way of a parliamentary question how many new step-down facilities had been created this year and how many had been lost in the system he could not supply the information because his Department does not collate it. Since then I have received a couple of sporadic missives from various health boards and hospitals outlining their position, but the information obtained is very patchy and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that officials in the Department do not know how many set-down facilities there are in the country at a time when the need for them is critical to resolving the winter beds crisis and to managing the use of the acute hospitals to best effect. Despite this the Minister is intent on selling his flawed initiative as a panacea for the crisis. He made an announcement about 500 additional beds but they are hired rather than additional. They will no longer be available to elderly people who are not using the hospital services but who are in need of nursing home care.</P>
    <P>In a radio interview the Minister tried to present his plan as providing benefits for public over private patients. That is not true. Some 80% of elderly people are on medical cards, whether they are seeking nursing home places or hospital services. To present this as some kind of benefit for public patients is disingenuous. The Minister is similarly disingenuous in stating that the appointment of 25 A&amp;E consultants and 15 anaesthetists will assist in the winter beds crisis. They will not because they will not be appointed in time. It is unworthy of the Minister to attempt to dress up a perfectly good initiative which we would all welcome wholeheartedly if he did not try to present it as something it is not to make him look better.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some aspects of this Bill and wish to refer specifically to the amendment of the 1970 Health Act. This amendment will incorporate in primary legislation provisions which are already provided for by way of regulation. Some aspects of this amendment are anti-consumer, particularly the agreement with pharmacists. Article 10 provides for this change in regard to pharmacies, presumably because there <Col N="327" /> are legislative difficulties which must be addressed. The Minister should not proceed with this amendment until the serious concerns which have already been put on record by consumer groups, the Competition Authority and Dr. Peter Bacon, in his report on supply and demand in the sector, are addressed. I realise this Minister did not make the agreement, which was a good one in many of its facets. As time passes, deficiencies in regulations and legislation often emerge and demand attention and this is one such case.</P>
    <P>The regulations, as they currently apply, are quite protectionist in nature and prevent the normal competition to which the public is entitled. I urge the Minister to establish a review which would deal with any existing deficiencies in order that this issue could be progressed. In terms of the promotion of pharmacist professionalism, there have been some benefits. It is clear pharmacists are key participants in primary care and I argue that they could play a greater part. Pharmacists ensure absolute accuracy in terms of prescriptions and ensure that there are no contraindications for patients. Patients who are prescribed a six week course of treatment and who may feel slightly better after three weeks or may not like the medication simply stop taking it. Somebody needs to identify those people because when patients do not follow through on a course of treatment which would deal with their problems, they can become even more ill and end up in hospital. A simple phone call from a pharmacist would ensure that courses of treatment are completed. Pharmacists would like to see more formalised contact between general practitioners and the other key players in the provision of primary care.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the agreement militates against an even and satisfactory spread of pharmacies nationwide. It prevents the growth of new pharmacies in areas where they are required and prevents newly qualified pharmacists from building up a business. Some pharmacists have certainly benefited from the current arrangements but others have not and the public interest has not always been served.</P>
    <P>Pharmacists serve local communities and obviously have a disproportionately elderly and sick customer base in comparison to other services. These customers often suffer as a consequence of the regulations' limits. The town of Knock in County Mayo is one example of where this has happened. It has received a great deal of publicity because of the high numbers of visitors to the village which does not have a pharmacy. The village of Roundwood is my constituency does not have a pharmacy either. As a local TD, I am aware of the problems this causes. Roundwood, which is described as the highest village in Ireland, is a considerable distance from any urban centres in which pharmacies operate. The lack of access to a local pharmacy causes distress and inconvenience to local people, particularly for those who depend on a very limited public trans<Col N="328" /> port service. It is not that nobody wants to meet their needs. A young pharmacist applied to open a pharmacy in Roundwood but was refused. In Wicklow town, there is a purpose built pharmacy building adjacent to a very busy health clinic. This is an ideal arrangement in terms of patients being able to access a full range of services from a GP or physiotherapist in the pharmacy. Again, it is not a case of nobody wanting to open a pharmacy in the building as a person who is already running a pharmacy in a nearby town has expressed interest in doing so but the regulations prevent that.</P>
    <P>I do not understand this protectionism. No doctor can prevent other doctors erecting a nameplate on their surgeries and inviting patients. One could say that the GMS entails certain restrictions but even those are less restrictive than these regulations. From where does this protectionism come and does it comply with EU free market criteria? I do not know the answer but I know that a demand for a very essential service is not being met. If it transpires that such a service cannot be sustained commercially, so be it, but the evidence suggests that because the regulations are so restrictive, that proposition cannot even be tested.</P>
    <P>The 'flu vaccination programme has been in operation for a short period. Problems were experienced in obtaining stocks of the vaccine and these resulted in supply shortages. It would be appalling if this were to happen again. I support the 'flu vaccination programme 100% but the Department should have ensured the availability of adequate supplies prior to its commencement. A GP in the Dublin area contacted my office saying that war had almost broken out in his surgery over the health board's failure to ensure full provision of vaccines. I understand the vaccine is not even included in the drugs refund scheme and I would like to hear the Minister's view on that exclusion.</P>
    <P>The fact that vaccination programmes run concurrently rather than consecutively places additional pressures on the system. The meningococcal vaccine is currently being administered but I suspect the level of take-up will not be as high as it could be. The pneumovax vaccine, which was to commence at the same time as the 'flu vaccine, did not commence until a later date and that creates its own inefficiencies.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains some positive provisions, among them its anti-smoking provisions. We all know that cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of death. It has been clearly identified as a major health risk and a significant cause of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, respiratory illness, peptic ulcers, emphysema, osteoporosis, mouth and throat cancer, peripheral vascular disease etc. Smoking affects pregnant women detrimentally, in addition to affecting the babies they carry. Smoking has been described as being more addictive than heroin and, unlike many other addictive substances, presents an environmental risk to non-smokers as <Col N="329" /> well as smokers. It results in enormous cost at a personal and societal level. The graveyards are full of the bodies of people whose lives were shortened by smoking. What is at issue is a dangerous drug which can have lethal effects. Some people manage to escape but others, sadly, do not. There is no doubt that the drug would be banned if it were to appear today for the first time on the market. However, that is now not feasible and would not work.</P>
    <P>It is important that everything possible is done to reduce the levels of smoking and there is a genuine consensus in the House which wants to ensure that happens. Too many people smoke for too long, and it is clear the black market would mushroom if there was an attempt to have an outright ban on tobacco.</P>
    <P>We are agreed that a multi-dimensional approach is required to include preventative measures, personal development, education, restrictions on sale and advertising, fiscal measures and medical and therapeutic treatment. The report initiated by Deputy Shatter and accepted by the Oireachtas committee set out a very good framework for action.</P>
    <P>The earlier people start smoking the more likely they are to become heavy smokers. Approximately one in every three young people who become regular smokers dies prematurely as a result. In Ireland, up to two-thirds of children have experimented with tobacco before they reach adulthood. Interrupting the cycle of childhood addiction requires decisive and effective action. The Slánú research shows that 40% of females between 18 and 34 years of age smoke as compared with 38% of young males. This shows an inordinately high level of smoking among young people and also a new and disturbing increase in the number of young women smoking. It is also significant that despite a drop in smoking here since the 1970s, there has been an increase in smoking levels since 1988.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has rightly made smoking a target for reduction from 30% to 20% over ten years. It is very ambitious, but if achieved it would have a tremendous impact on the general health status of the population. While there is no real evidence that such a goal will even begin to be reached under the Government, we will support every effort made by the Minister. However, we will not support any attempt, to which the Minister is prone, at hyping or exaggerating the effectiveness of measures he takes on this or any other issue.</P>
    <P>It is a modest Bill which was due to come before the House in any event, with the anti-smoking measures simply tacked on. Presenting a portmanteau Bill is hardly an auspicious start to a crusade to tackle nicotine addiction. That said, the measures are welcome as far as they go. However, one wonders how far they will go. How will the regulations be enforced and how effective will they be? What mechanisms will guarantee results?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> A recent report from the Western Health Board says that 98% of tobacconists surveyed in Roscommon, 61% in Mayo and 30% of those in Galway were found to be selling tobacco to children under 14 years of age. Even without the Bill, such activity is illegal. There is no doubt that respectable shopkeepers are systematically breaking the law, it would appear on an ongoing basis. It is fair to assume this law breaking is not restricted to one part of the country.</P>
    <P>It augurs badly if the changes proposed in the Bill are being introduced in an environment and culture which tolerates on a wide scale the sale of cigarettes to children, even though it is illegal. The lesson is clear. We must ensure that laws enacted are implemented and accept that legislation without education is severely limited in its effect. Educating, not just shopkeepers, but young people at risk, should be a fundamental pillar of any new strategy.</P>
    <P>However, it must take on board the actual experience of young people rather than imposing a view. In particular, the rise in smoking among young girls signals that we must address the underlying reasons why young girls are choosing to take up smoking. An example I often give is that it might be as much benefit to bring Weight Watchers or some similar organisation into schools to encourage young girls to manage a good diet so they do not feel uncomfortable about weight issues. Obesity is growing very fast across the western world, including in Ireland and it is clearly a strong factor in why some young girls, who are insecure about their self-image, take up smoking.</P>
    <P>When the EU Commissioner, David Byrne, spoke at the recent North-South conference organised by the BMA and the IMA, concern was expressed by health professionals at the deeply contradictory approach adopted at EU level. On the one hand there is an agreement on anti-smoking measures, including a ban on advertising, but on the other hand the EU continues to subvent tobacco growing to the tune of 2 billion ECUs per year. Many subsistence farmers in Greece and Italy depend for their livelihoods on growing tobacco, but this cannot be a justification to continue such a policy in future. Those visiting Greece see widespread advertising and constant promotion of smoking, which is bound to create and maintain a high level of addiction.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we reflect an EU average of about 30%, and the rate is growing. By contrast, the US is approaching a level of 20%, which tells us something. The US is libertarian in its outlook, with individuals having the right to carry a gun but not allowed to smoke a cigarette in most circumstances. This shows the possibilities of creating a new climate which can address the addiction. We do not have the same cultural and historic attachment to the idea of individual liberties and personal freedoms, and it should, therefore, be possible and easier for us to ensure the level of cigarette smoking is reduced, particularly among young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> The North Western Health Board has shown a way forward in terms of education. From the evidence produced by the board it is clear that school health promotion programmes work and that young people absorb the messages they are given. We must examine this carefully as there is always the danger with blanket campaigns that the anxious healthy people take up the message rather than those who actually need to listen to it.</P>
    <P>Social class is also an issue, as it underlines all issues relating to health. Slánú research has shown over and over again that poverty creates ill-health and is a key factor in terms of health status.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to again refer to private nursing homes. Convalescent homes should be subject to regulation. My understanding is that health board welfare homes do not come within the provisions of the existing legislation. Who is in charge of maintaining and ensuring standards in welfare homes which care for the elderly? In terms of general health provision it is astonishing that anybody can come to the country and set up a private hospital and that all they need is planning permission and a fire safety certificate. That is untenable. There are issues regarding standards in hospitals, nursing homes and welfare and convalescent homes.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the issue raised by Deputy Mitchell is a very stark feature of quite a number of our hospitals, which are still unnamed, namely the horrifying extent of MRSA which cannot yet be pinpointed because the information has not been released as to which hospitals are at fault and how the matter is being addressed. The idea of sending patients home rather than keeping them in hospital sounds like good common sense. If a person can be cared for at home or in the community they should not be retained in hospitals. Generally speaking, acute hospitals are not safe places to be when one sees the levels of MRSA.</P>
    <P>I lost a dear friend who had a most horrific death having suffered for a long period because she contracted MRSA. This happened in a private hospital. The serious aspect of hospital accreditation and maintenance of standards needs to be tackled, but perhaps not in this Bill. The work done in relation to standards in private nursing homes has been beneficial, particularly for the residents. The same approach needs to be extended beyond private nursing homes. I have no doubt we will return to that in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of issues will be raised on Committee Stage. It is not satisfactory that we are dealing with three different areas of health care in one Bill. It would be much more satisfactory if smoking, pharmacists and nursing homes, which are in no way related to one another, were each given their own Bill. It would be a better practice and less likely to lead to difficulties in the future. That said, I hope we will be able to progress this Bill and improve it when the time comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, will improve three significant areas of health care. It will improve supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances &ndash; this is timely and has been called for some time. It will provide regulations for the efficient administration of payment schemes for patients in nursing homes and it will strengthen the laws regarding the sale of tobacco products to deter its use by minors. I wish to home in on the latter.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children I am deeply concerned about the relationship between the population and the attitude to smoking. Tobacco use alone contributes to the death of more than three million people globally on a yearly basis. Of those 500,000 are citizens of the European Union and 6,000 are Irish. The number of people who die from smoking related illnesses is six times the number killed as a result of road accidents, work related accidents, drugs, murder, suicide and AIDS combined. This is the most important public health challenge facing any Minister for Health and Children. It is not a secret that smoking has detrimental effects on the heart, brain, lungs and the reproductive system and that it is a leading cause in various types of cancer.</P>
      <P>According to a report published by the Royal College of Physicians in London, cigarettes should be seen as a manifestation of nicotine addiction. Nicotine is as addictive as the so-called &ldquo;hard drugs&rdquo; such as heroin. Each year, unfortunately, more and more young people are becoming dangerously addicted to nicotine. It was with this in mind that the Joint Committee on Health and Children set three main objectives, namely, the elimination of underage smoking, a substantial reduction in the number of adult smokers and the protection of the public from environmental smoke. The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill aids the accomplishment of these goals but Irish tobacco legislation needs to be pushed even further to provide a safe smoke-free society for all of Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the need to eliminate underage smoking the Bill proposes to increase the age at which tobacco can be legally purchased from 16 to 18 and to increase the maximum fines imposed on those convicted of selling to underage persons as a deterrent to retailers. The problem of young people smoking cannot be over stressed. A report compiled by the committee shows that 21% of children, between the ages of nine and 17, are smoking despite the current law. That law mandates one to be 16 years to purchase cigarettes. Therefore, not only is it necessary to increase the age at which one can purchase cigarettes but a plan to ensure these laws are enforced also needs to be devised. I agree with Deputy McManus that many of our laws in this area are observed in the breach rather than being a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the survey of 200 shops which was undertaken by the Mid-Western Health Board in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscom<Col N="333" /> mon where it was found that 51% of the shops sold tobacco products to children not older than 14 years of age. In a number of stings carried out the child continued to be sold cigarettes even after that child honestly stated his or her age. That is blatant flouting of the law. In one county the law was defied in 93% of the shops surveyed. There has never been a precedent of prosecutions for such breaches of the law. This strongly reflects the need to raise the fines and penalties applicable to those who sell tobacco to minors and to put strength behind the law with enforcement. I suggest, given that in many instances the law up to now has not been observed, that shops should be required to register as tobacco suppliers and if they are caught selling tobacco to underage persons the shop should be removed from the register and tobacco should no longer be supplied to it. In such circumstances there would be a dramatic change of attitude in terms of the law.</P>
    <P>Another factor which greatly influences smoking by younger persons is advertising. Tobacco companies claim that smoking is a choice, that it is not an addiction. However, magazines, television, billboards and sporting events are plagued with images which portray smoking as a glamorous activity. One can imagine fashion conscious young people turning to cigarettes to fulfil the image portrayed through those advertisements. Shops are filled with cigarettes and tobacco advertising which is at the eye level of every child and teenager who enters the store.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the European Union issued a directive to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship. Despite the recent rejection of this directive by the European Court of Justice, Ireland still needs to push forward and prohibit tobacco advertising at a national level. Research supports the view that the absence of tobacco advertising will decrease the rate of its use especially among young people. We need to remove cigarettes from the eye level of young people in shops. The state of California is looked at as the model of an anti-tobacco society around the world. Even in California, at the point of sale, advertising and the placing of cigarettes at eye level in stores is still allowed.</P>
    <P>If Ireland is successful in passing the proposed anti-tobacco legislation it will have some of the world's toughest tobacco laws and will stand above the world in the struggle to move away from tobacco use, from its addiction and from its disastrous health effects.</P>
    <P>Another issue that surrounds smoking by underage persons is the vending machine. Pubs and restaurants have cigarette vending machines which are available to everyone. It is in the most open location possible. There is no monitoring, no control and no question asked as to who can have access to them. It is essential that vending machines are kept behind counters in pubs to ensure cigarettes are not purchased by underage persons. Vending machines do not have to be kept behind counters but they must be kept out of the reach of young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> The committee's second objective is to reduce the number of adult smokers, many of whom would like to quit but cannot. Most Members smoked at some stage and those who have given up know the difficulties involved. Many of us still enjoy the smell of cigarettes and cigars. Unfortunately, many adults are hopelessly addicted to nicotine and cannot give up smoking.</P>
    <P>It has been statistically shown that 63% of smokers consume more than ten cigarettes per day. This is a very disheartening figure, particularly given the fact that there have been so many advances and research projects in the area of giving up smoking. Many trials show that nicotine replacement therapies can double the rate of those who give up smoking. Such therapies need to be more accessible to give people the opportunity to overcome their addiction and, ultimately, to prevent many of the terrible diseases caused by tobacco and eradicate the extraordinary cost to the health service of dealing with those diseases. We should also examine the possibility of making nicotine replacement therapies available free of charge to medical card holders as it is extraordinary that smoking rates are highest in deprived areas. Making replacement therapies available to medical card holders would go a long way towards addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>Tobacco not only affects smokers, it also has detrimental effects on those surrounded by smokers. This leads me to the committee's third objective, which is the protection of the public. This objective falls into two main categories, namely, the physical protection of the public from smoke and the protection the public receives from the knowledge of the effects of tobacco products. As regards the physical protection of people, it is necessary to review and ultimately to ban smoking in public places and the workplace. Consumer issues are involved in banning smoking in pubs but one of the committee's recommendations was that smoking be banned in restaurants and public houses. I do not demur from this recommendation because if 6,000 people are killed by smoking every year we should be fearless in ensuring we reduce the number of people consuming tobacco. We must also be conscious of the need to restrict the number of places in which smoking is allowed.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people regarding the provision of no smoking areas in restaurants. The vast majority of people would welcome and accept the total prohibition of smoking in restaurants. People would also accept that there should be no provision in law which allows smoking in restaurants as it interferes with the quality of food and the atmosphere in which food is consumed. A confined workplace in which smoking is allowed can be very dangerous. The common good of having clean air to breathe should outweigh all other considerations.</P>
    <P>The knowledge of the negative effects of tobacco is necessary to protect the public from its dangers. During the 1930s and 1940s cigarettes <Col N="335" /> were sold by tobacco companies without any warning about their detrimental effects on health. Since then it has become increasingly evident that smoking cigarettes is detrimental to health. However, tobacco companies get away with providing the minimum warnings and will only disclose as much information as they are legally required to do.</P>
    <P>When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children was recently granted powers of discovery for a forthcoming investigation into the tobacco industry, it received responses from Gallahers, Carrolls and Players who refused to voluntarily provide documentation on the safety of their products. Their justification for this refusal is that any evidence or documents they present may be used in legal action against them. This approach is very disappointing because, although there have been successful tobacco litigation cases in the US in which $140 billion was awarded in punitive damages, it has not been decided whether Ireland will go down this road.</P>
    <P>I stress that the committee's primary objective is to ensure that tobacco companies provide this information in the public interest in the first instance, but also to help devise future health strategies as a result of the lessons of the past. The fact that tobacco companies refuse to disclose information on the safety of their products is a major concern for the Minister and the committee. In the past, tobacco companies hid evidence of the detrimental effects of smoking. As a society we cannot allow this to happen again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell was correct when he referred to the detrimental effects of excessive drinking. The Deputy was also correct to suggest that the health and children committee should examine this issue. Deputy Mitchell is a new member of the committee and I am pleased the committee has decided to give this issue a high priority by way of producing a report. The committee will also have to examine the advertising of alcohol, particularly its association with sporting organisations whereby young people are inculcated in healthy activities by organisations which are supported by companies whose products could have detrimental effects on their health.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Mitchell's comments on appointments to the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. I would hate to think the Deputy would cast aspersions on the integrity of three people from the Cork area who were recently appointed by the Minister, Deputy Martin. The general manager of the university hospital, Cork, has traditionally been a member of the board of the blood transfusion service. How could anybody object to the legitimacy of the appointment of either Dr. Horgan or Dr. Elizabeth Keane, both of whom are eminent specialists in the public health area in the Southern Health Board, and suggest that there would be a political dimension to those appointments? <Col N="336" /> It is ridiculous in the extreme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of it. However, if it is suggested in the course of a speech on this Bill that there is a question about the integrity of some people who were appointed to the board, it is important that the matter should be addressed in the interests of the people concerned who cannot answer for themselves in this House, particularly when they are people of the highest integrity and specialists in their field in the health service.</P>
      <P>The Bill is obviously timely. I have addressed the nursing home provisions in it but I want to mention that nursing homes are finding it extremely difficult to get nurses. Like some of the Dublin hospitals, they now must bring in nurses from abroad.</P>
      <P>There must be equity in the induction programme for nurses coming to Ireland and proposing to work in private nursing homes. It is not fair to ensure that priority is given to the public health service without giving a similar protection to the private nursing homes. After all, we in the health service are referring many people, who cannot be accommodated in community hospitals, to nursing homes and we are providing subventions to those nursing homes. In the Southern Health Board area, nurses being introduced from abroad may endure a lengthy wait before they are provided with the six-week induction course. I want this issue looked at and addressed and I want equity in the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have just been appointed to the Committee on Health and Children, I take this opportunity to tell Deputy O'Keeffe, the chairman of the committee, that I find him to be a fair and good chairman. In my short time as a member of the committee, he has been courteous and <Col N="337" /> helpful. At the first meeting I attended, I raised an issue in the context of the Department of Health and Children's concern regarding the tobacco industry. I was annoyed and upset and I think I was the first to raise concern at the fact that there was such an attack on the tobacco companies and yet there was not the same enthusiasm to attack the alcoholic drink companies. The Chairman reassured me that we will take up the matter at the committee and that satisfied me. I compliment him, as Chairman, and I look forward to working with him. We will deal with the other problems on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The way the Western Health Board prosecuted some small shop keepers was mentioned frequently and I spoke about this here previously. I would not give any great credit to the health board for the way it did this. I am totally opposed to smoking but I am more opposed to alcohol abuse, which affects family life. At least smokers know there is a risk to themselves. I realise that passive smokers are affected also, but alcohol abuse affects, upsets and hurts so many families and we see this on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Last weekend it was depressing to read the court reports in the three local newspapers in my county. All of the cases related to alcohol abuse, late night drinking and how violent we have become as a result of alcohol. Alcohol has an effect on young people which is like that of drugs but the Government is not conducting any major research on it because people in the alcoholic drinks industry have a vested interest in it and comprise a powerful lobby.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will respond to this point when he replies to the debate. People who suffer from mental illness and are in hospital seem to depend on cigarettes. I hope on Committee Stage we will ensure we do not impose on such people the restrictions we propose for the tobacco industry in the Bill. These people need cigarettes as their only comfort. They like their cigarettes and I hope we will not be too severe on them but will be sympathetic. These people should be protected and smoking should not be outlawed in mental hospitals.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that smoking was acceptable 20 years ago. Deputy O'Keeffe was correct. I am sure many Members of the House are former smokers. I happen to be. I hate cigarettes but I feel that if I smoked one cigarette, I would be addicted and I do not think I would have the power to give them up again. I have given them up three or four times. I have been off them now for about ten years and I hope I can stay off them. I like the smell of them but it makes me want to smoke and that is why I hate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than use the law on the few small shop keepers left in the west, it would be better if people, particularly from the Department of Health and Children, went into the schools to talk to the pupils and show slides depicting the health effects of cigarettes. The small shops are being replaced by the major supermarkets, which do <Col N="338" /> not seem to be attacked by the health boards as often as the small shop keepers.</P>
    <P>No man or woman would sell cigarettes to a child if he or she knew the child was under age but there was a tradition in Ireland that a father, mother, brother or sister who smoked would send children to the shop to buy cigarettes and people must learn that they cannot do that anymore because it would to break the law. I welcome the measures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to compliment Deputy Shatter, who introduced a Private Members' Bill in the House and did a substantial amount of work in this area. The tobacco industry certainly deserves this current attack and I hope the alcoholic drinks companies will be treated similarly because that is another issue which we in the committee and the Minister and the Department of Health and Children must deal with, although they are shying away from it.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of young people, particularly girls, are smoking. That should be dealt with at an educational level. I would hope the Minister and the Department will introduce an educational programme in the schools. It would be a good idea and the money would be well spent. If the officials brought in slides and showed the pupils what was happening, perhaps more of them would stop smoking. I would go a step further. If they were to speak about cigarettes, they could also speak about alcohol and show the effects of alcohol on families and people's health. That is what should be happening.</P>
    <P>People should be prosecuted for knowingly selling cigarettes to children but it is difficult to know the age of a young person and that is the problem. The health board should not send a young official into a shop where a person might just be working part-time, as happened in one case of which I am aware where there was a prosecution. The shop got very bad publicity, both locally and nationally. The owners were outraged, upset and hurt because they are honourable decent people in the community who work hard to make ends meet. It was a difficult time for them. I hope to see the health board being active in regard to its other responsibilities, and I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>This Bill also talks about pharmacies with regard to something which is very close to the heart of the Minister of State, to mine and the hearts of the people of County Mayo. The cartel in relation to pharmacies can be broken. I know the former Minister included something in legislation in the past and I hope this Bill will deal with this. There is a stupid situation in Knock, to which thousands of people go on a daily basis, whereby there is no pharmacy because of some regulation the health board and the Department of Health and Children brought into being. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is working hard on that and I hope he will get a result and will open up the pharmacy area. I do not believe in cartels. I accept that because of the drug problem, we have to have laws, regulations <Col N="339" /> and rules but this cartel is too cosy. I hope the Minister of State, in the context of this Bill, will deal with the problem we have in Knock and that in the next few months, he will announce that the Minister for Health and Children, the Government and the health board have decided to allow pharmacies to open in Knock. I am sure there are many towns like Knock where there is a need for this service.</P>
    <P>An individual contacted me recently &ndash; the Minister of State and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who are doctors might understand this point &ndash; who had spent some time in hospital. The person was sent home on a Saturday and on the way out of the hospital was given a prescription. The person was going home to a rural area where no pharmacy would be open until the following Monday morning. Is it not possible for the hospital to give the drugs needed to carry a person over for at least a day given that some individuals are 70 miles from home and from there, another ten miles from a pharmacy which may not open on a Sunday? Would it not be possible for the hospital to give people living in rural areas, being discharged from hospital at the weekend, the drugs they need to carry them over for at least 24 hours? That is a reasonable request and I hope something can be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>In recent years, medical cards have been taken from thousands of people who do not have large incomes; these are families which, because of the crazy situation and the guidelines in relation to qualification for a medical card, have lost their medical cards. I am open to correction but I think the income limit is £93 for a single person and £135 for a family in order to qualify for a medical card. Even if someone only works for a few hours each week, with the minimum wage, he would go over the limit in the guidelines for the medical card. We want to see the levels in the guidelines substantially increased and I hope that will happen in the forthcoming budget and that the thousands of people who have been excluded from the medical card scheme will be brought back into it. It is just not right.</P>
    <P>I know doctors will not like me saying this, but it is bad enough for people on low incomes to have to go to the chemist, which will charge its fee, but the big problem now is the amount our GPs are charging. In my county, they are talking about increasing the charge for a call to £32. What about the family on £200 per week without a medical card, paying a mortgage and which has to go to a GP? My daughter got a throat infection and the doctor had to visit on three different occasions. We had to get three different medications because it was discovered that she was being treated for the wrong ailment. However, the real problem was that it nearly cost us a small fortune. It was the first time I ever used the drug subsidy scheme because it all happened within the one month. What if that had been a family on a low income which had lost out on a medical card by £5 or £10 and had to get the doctor three <Col N="340" /> or four times in one week? The problem now is the fees GPs charge.</P>
    <P>The GPs do a wonderful job and I would like to see them getting more resources to help them. If the GPs were given assistance, we would have fewer people in hospitals. I compliment the GPs in my area because they do an excellent job for the people and I hope the Government will see fit to reward them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will know I feel strongly about care of the elderly before I became spokesman on the elderly. As he will know, last year a report on the elderly was released. It stated that as much as 3% of the population &ndash; more than 12,000 older people &ndash; was subject to abuse. If that happened in any other country, we would lecture about it. Members would stand up on the Order of Business on a regular basis telling the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make contact with that Government to make sure that did not happen, yet it can happen in our country. That is not acceptable in the new millennium. I know the Minister of State has set up a group to deal with this and that the review group has met on a number of occasions. I hope that, as a result of that review group, we will see action from the Minister of State and the Department.</P>
    <P>We have seen court cases where people have been prosecuted for the abuse of the elderly. Another daft thing happening in this State is that if a person opened a private nursing home tomorrow morning one would have to get planning permission, would have to go through the health board and would have to live within the law. There is an inspectorate in place which could visit that nursing home at any time. However, there is no inspectorate in place for public nursing homes owned and run by the State. We cannot have double standards and that must be resolved as quickly as possible. It does not make sense as far as I am concerned. I hope the Minister and the Government will deal with that problem as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State will know, there are 381 registered nursing homes with a capacity for 24,058 people and there are 12,637 private beds available. The subvention in this State is outrageous and the guidelines refer to £60, £70 and £120. There are three categories of dependants which have to be medically assessed before people will qualify. It is time we considered increasing the subvention. Those who put people into private nursing homes are saving the State a small fortune. The amount of the subvention which the Department of Health and Children is providing is not adequate to deal with the problem. I hope the Government will deal with that in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>As to the housing needs of the elderly, the Minister of State recently introduced a scheme to provide heating in their homes. To be fair to the Minister of State, and I have been critical of him, he provided the funding but I am not at all satisfied that the health boards are spending it correctly. There were many advertisements and <Col N="341" /> press releases telling the people this funding was in place. Thousands of applications were made to the health boards and the council for this scheme. Last year the Western Health Board &ndash; I tabled parliamentary questions on this matter because I had great difficulty getting the information &ndash; dealt with three cases after the Minister of State had provided the funding. That is wrong and mean, and the Minister of State and Government will have to deal with this.</P>
    <P>If a heating scheme is announced for elderly people, then it should be for heating for elderly people and the officials in the health board should not dictate to the Minister of State, to me or to the people that its priority is roofs, windows or whatever. If the scheme is not being used for what it was intended, it should be withdrawn immediately.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has to address serious concerns with regard to the British tourism market to Ireland which is our largest tourism market; and if he will review the destination marketing of Ireland programme contained in the national development plan.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26204/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan includes an allocation of £150 million for a tourism marketing sub-programme over the period 2000-06 and consists of two measures, a destination marketing measure and a niche marketing measure. Decisions as to the allocation of funding under this sub-programme are a matter for Bord Fáilte in consultation with the Tourism Marketing Partnership, a special group set up within Bord Fáilte composed of Bord Fáilte executives and tourism industry representatives.</P>
      <P>Britain is our largest and most important tourism source market, accounting for more than 3.4 million visitors in 1999 or 58% of total overseas visitors and almost £800 million or 43% of overseas revenue. However, growth in visitor revenue slowed to 5% in 1999 compared to annual average growth of 15% in previous years. The British holiday market is among the most competitive in the world and is constantly changing. Although sterling remains strong, all foreign travel is cheaper and new exotic destinations now come within the reach of a wider number of British holidaymakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Latest intelligence for 2000 indicates that the length of stay of British holidaymakers to Ireland continues to shorten, with above average growth in short breaks to cities such as Dublin and Cork in additional holidays, at the expense of the more <Col N="342" /> traditional main holiday. This is part of a long-term trend in the short-haul international tourism market, affecting all holiday taking. Shorter holidays are now the most dynamic growth sector affording us new and growing opportunities in that area.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte commissioned an independent review of Irish performance in the British market within the past 12 months. I understand that, given the importance of the British market to Ireland, Bord Fáilte is already addressing, in full consultation with the industry, the current issues arising within the British market as highlighted in this review.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>A combined industry and Bord Fáilte response is expected to emerge through the Tourism Marketing Partnership which will outline future strategy for the British market. Meanwhile, in the immediate term, Bord Fáilte will, I understand, be running a combination of brand building with a tactical advertising campaign which will highlight value for money and product options. Bord Fáilte state that it also proposes to work with the industry to develop a direct marketing approach to make the most of the potential for repeat business.</P>
    <P>There is already provision for a comprehensive mid-term review of measures in the national development plan in 2003 which will include the operation of the destination marketing measure. The Deputy will be pleased to note that notwithstanding our concerns about the British market, official CSO figures for the first half of 2000 showed that total British visitors grew by 2%. I understand from Bord Fáilte that preliminary unpublished figures show there was further growth up to August.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, despite peace on this island and the strength of sterling, it must be very worrying that the British market is becoming stagnant? Does he agree there is a fundamental change taking place in the attitude of British people to holidays and that studies and investment in advertising will not in itself solve the matter? Does he agree the competitiveness of our industry and access to areas outside our cities are important factors in coming to grips with what is becoming a major problem in relation to the British tourism market? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are problems associated with the British tourism market, as with other markets. I have pointed out to the Deputy that the British market is not just competitive to us but also to every other country. The Deputy pointed out the strength of sterling. Sterling is very strong throughout the entire European zone, including in France, Italy and Spain. There will be advertising of destinations which are exceptionally competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to various parts of the country is a very important factor which we must continue to <Col N="343" /> improve. Certain areas are over-congested as a result of the tourism bonanza which has taken place in the past ten years. I hope Bord Fáilte will continue to address this issue in the context of the North-South body which has been set up. I accept the market exists but the British market continues to be our most important market. Some 3.4 million visitors come from Britain. There was a certain downturn in the market last year but recent reports indicate the British market is again picking up. I returned from the World Travel Fair in London yesterday where all those involved in the industry indicated it was a bonanza week for them. There were dips in the market last year but I believe we are overcoming that downturn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's sense of complacency in relation to the British market. Does he agree that the recent rail and airline strikes and the congested roads are a far cry from Ireland's image in the past of open roads and uncrowded countryside? Given the slowing down in the friends and relations tourism market to Ireland, does the Minister agree there is now a need for a major rethink in relation to the issue? Has he engaged seriously with the industry sources to establish what are the problems as they see it? Has he ensured that Bord Fáilte has consulted with the regional authorities involved in tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about aspects of the research carried out in relation to the tourism industry and we have undertaken a review of that aspect. The Deputy is correct in saying there is a problem regarding visiting friends and relations. This is partly due to the fact that many people have returned from the UK to live in this country. That does not mean there is not a large proportion of people with Irish ancestry in the UK whom we must continue to target. Nevertheless, a small vacuum has developed in this area. I was the first Minister to give the regional tourism authorities a budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined to the House in reply to parliamentary questions on 10 October last, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; estimates the cost of the development of the Sports Campus Ireland project, including Stadium Ireland, to be £550 million, to be funded from a combination of private and public sector money. This estimate covers the cost of an 80,000 seat stadium, where the cost remains at £281 million as outlined in the feasibility study, including a private contribution of £50 million. The cost also covers the other elements that will be provided in Sports Campus Ireland, including an aquatic and leisure centre, a multi-purpose indoor arena, multi-purpose indoor training halls and pitches, a sports science and sports medicine centre, headquarters for sports organisations, a visitor centre and other sports facilities to be decided in consultation with the Irish Sports Council.</P>
      <P>The development is being undertaken on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. CSID estimates that of the total cost of £550 million, the return related and fully funded private sector elements are in the region of £150 million. Taking account of the private donation of £50 million, the remaining public sector cost is estimated at £350 million.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to the lodging of an application for planning permission and when construction of the various elements of the project will commence are matters for CSID. However, I can tell the House that CSID is proceeding as quickly as possible with the aquatic and leisure centre, with the aim of having it ready by the end of 2002 to enable the Special Olympics to take place there in the summer of 2003.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study outlined that a minimum base case of six events per year was required to make the stadium viable. The study also outlined the positive response from the major sporting organisations to holding games in the stadium. Against the background of the findings of the feasibility study, CSID is having discussions with the national sporting organisations about the number of events that will take place in the stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about the positive responses from the sporting organisations. I understand that the FAI would consider staging events with an attendance of more than 60,000 every six or seven years. The GAA foresees major games being played in the stadium and I understand there has been a more positive <Col N="345" /> response from the IRFU. Are the commitments from sporting bodies any more firm than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The company is in constant contact with the national sporting organisations. The Deputy is correct in stating that the FAI has indicated it might use the stadium every six or seven years. I have more confidence than that in the capabilities of the Irish team. Last night, during an unpopular time of year, more than 20,000 people attended a friendly match against Finland. All the national organisations have indicated their willingness to proceed with the stadium, including the GAA and the IRFU.</P>

      <P>The stadium project will go ahead. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have given their full commitment to it. We are a modern, sophisticated and confident European nation. The Deputy has a right to inquire about costs, that is the right of public representatives. There is a political will to develop sporting facilities. As we are a sports mad nation I see no reason not to proceed with the stadium in this time of plenty. I have every confidence that the major organisations will support the stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be inferred from what the Minister said that the FAI is not competent to design its own stadium. That organisation seems to assume that except for an occasion every six or seven years, a 45,000 seat stadium will be adequate.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the donation of £50 million from a private donor may be conditional on the setting up of an independent European soccer super-league, some of whose matches could be played in Dublin? The document of agreement contains no name. Can the Minister assure the House that the money emanates from a single individual and not from a consortium which may seek a franchise in the context of the league I have just mentioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of public advertisement my Department invited applications for funding under the sports capital programme for 2000 during December 1999. The closing date for receipt of completed application forms was 11 February 2000.</P>
      <P>By the closing date 1,650 applications had been received from clubs and organisations throughout the country. The total value of grants applied for was £184 million.</P>
      <P>My Department then carried out a detailed assessment of the applications in accordance with the published conditions and criteria pertaining to the programme. Following this assessment process, grants totalling £36 million were allocated to 677 projects under the sports capital programme 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>This shows the real picture of sporting infrastructure in Ireland. Almost 1,000 clubs and organisations were disappointed in their applications for funding. Grants totalling £184 million were applied for and £36 million was allocated. The real story is one of primitive infrastructure. Will the Minister now reconsider his position regarding a national stadium? He proposes to invest almost £1 billion in a national stadium when almost 1,000 clubs have been refused grant aid. In many of those clubs young people are dressing and undressing on the sides of ditches and preparing for matches in antiquated dressing rooms. Will the Minister reconsider his decision regarding a national stadium in the light of these frightening statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to say we are proceeding with the provision of facilities for all organisations. In 1995, when Deputy Allen was Minister of State with responsibility for sport he gave grants of £3 million. In 1996 he gave £5 million and in 1997 he gave £9 million. Last year the Government gave grants of £36 million, which is more in one year than the previous Government gave in its three years of office.</P>
      <P>Grants to sporting organisations come from public money and criteria must be applied them. There are currently 1,300 applications for funding of £56 million. These projects are about to be started, being started or about to finish. Every grant application cannot qualify for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen repeats the point about sports people changing on the side of the roads. I cannot imagine where the Deputy has been recently. I <Col N="347" /> have been around the country and while I accept that some clubs work in very difficult circumstances, 96% of the applications I receive are the upgrading existing facilities. Perhaps the facilities exist thanks to money given by Deputy Allen. Sports people are becoming more discerning. They want better facilities and they should get them. Funding is being sought for floodlighting and so on.</P>
    <P>Some of the £56 million will be returned to the Department of Finance because projects could not be started. Clubs are experiencing difficulties in finding people to do work on development projects. If we cannot spend £56 million, how can we be expected to spend £500,000, as Deputy Allen proposes? Is the Deputy proposing that plans should be drawn up and left idle? I am allocating funding to clubs which have the capacity to start projects.</P>
    <P>Some clubs applied for small grants of between £5,000 and £5,000. The average grant last year was £53,000 and that is a huge improvement on previous years. There is political will, but the difference is that the stadium is a national project. It will be a national asset and the other people will be facilitated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>

      <P>I deal with reality and I invite the Minister to visit some of the clubs of which I am aware where people must dress on the side of ditches and roads because of a lack of facilities. Clubs are not getting money because the funding is spread so thinly on the ground. Clubs seeking £20,000 or £30,000 are receiving £10,000 or £12,000 and they cannot proceed with projects. I ask the Minister to consider prioritising the development of a national sporting infrastructure rather than putting £1 billion into what I term the Taoiseach's &ldquo;doughnut&rdquo;&ndash; all icing and sweetness on the outside but a big hole in the middle. This national stadium will be underutilised. At present, it does not have an anchor tenant and it will be a millstone around the country's sporting infrastructure for many years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish tourism and hospitality industry has been an extremely vibrant one over the past ten years, catering last year alone for six million over<Col N="349" /> seas visitors in addition to the rapidly expanding demand from the local domestic market and bringing over £2.5 billion in foreign exchange revenue into our economy. This success has created new challenges for the industry, not only in terms of maintaining its competitive position in an ever more competitive international environment, but also in the competition for staff in Ireland's tightening labour market.</P>
    <P>Visitor attitude surveys conducted by Bord Fáilte give an indication of visitors' perception of service quality. The most recent such survey for 1999 suggests that while the rating of quality and customer service in hotels and other accommodation remains high, there is some evidence of slippage. The rating of quality and customer service in less formal types of accommodation has generally improved while the rating of customer service in food outlets has generally declined to some extent.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no room for complacency and the tourism industry representative bodies and CERT continue to work individually and in partnership to promote careers and to encourage the adoption of world class standards in all aspects of the tourism and hospitality industry. However, the industry needs to further deepen its partnership with CERT which is actively encouraging and promoting the development of training capacity and better human resource management skills within the industry itself. Achieving this objective will be essential if the industry is to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided £107 million under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to help industry secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. In this context, over £15 million has been allocated to CERT in 2000 to enable it to commence the implementation of its recently launched strategic plan 2000-2006, which is designed to deliver the objectives set out in the NDP for raising and maintaining the highest operational and human resource standards in tourism.</P>
    <P>Initiatives to promote careers and world class service in the industry include the development by CERT of a new nationwide programme, which I launched earlier this year, to encourage people who have been out of the workforce for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry. This follows another scheme launched in May 1999 in Ballymun, targeted at long-term unemployment blackspots which has proved very popular and successful with participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses.</P>
    <P>CERT's annual careers roadshow was launched on 16 October 2000, it will visit a total of 16 venues countrywide and hold over 70 sessions in <Col N="350" /> various second level institutions. It is targeted at second level students from transition year to leaving certificate level and is implemented in partnership with the major industry bodies, including the Irish Hotels' Federation, the Restaurants' Association of Ireland, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association. The roadshow is being advertised through local radio stations and newspapers. On 12 October I launched the careers magazine, <i>Get a Life in Tourism</i>. This magazine is a CERT joint venture with the industry bodies and highlights the variety of careers on offer in the sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>CERT recently launched the new RETAIN initiative to help address concerns in the tourism and hospitality industry over recruitment and staff retention. Financial assistance of up to £15,000 over a three year period will be available, under certain conditions, to businesses for improvement in human resources management, which is the key to tackling the industry's staffing problems. These new supports are designed to attract participation in the scheme from firms right across the industry. Smaller companies, whose individual needs may not warrant a dedicated human resource professional, are being encouraged to consider joining others with a view to sharing a dedicated human resource executive. Alongside the new scheme, CERT will be running a series of courses for owners and general managers on modern human resource best practice.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels, I understand that tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Scotland and Wales which have proved successful in attracting staff to Ireland. Recruitment drives are currently being considered for other European locations. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, which welcomes employers to such recruitment drives. I understand the Irish Hotels' Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual bodies are also participating in EURES, the European Employment Service, to help satisfy labour shortages in the hospitality sector. Employers will also be encouraged to use the recently developed CERT induction pack for international workers.</P>
    <P>On many occasions since taking office, I have urged the industry to become more proactive in addressing recruitment difficulties and labour shortages and to take appropriate steps to counter the perceived poor image of tourism as a career opportunity. In this context, I was particularly pleased to welcome the Irish Hotels' Federation's quality employer programme which was introduced over three years ago and is based on best practice in all aspects of employment, including recruitment, induction training, ongoing performance assessment, career progression and conditions of pay and employment.</P>
    <P>The Restaurants' Association of Ireland's restaurant and customer charter is another good example of the type of initiative needed. In view <Col N="351" /> of the importance of such initiatives, I am pleased to note that CERT will be organising a major conference on 27 November on &ldquo;World Class Service in Tourism and Hospitality&rdquo; for general managers and senior executives in the industry. Featuring a panel of international speakers and the findings of the latest international research carried out this year, the conference will focus on the best practice in human resources and operations management with a view to its adoption here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that finding the 145,000 workers required for the tourism industry over the next five years will be a major difficulty? Will the Department give a guarantee that it will assist the industry in language training for staff who are non-residents? Will the Minister support a call by the Irish Hotels' Federation for a tax break to entice homemakers back into the workforce? What initiatives is the Department putting in place to attract young people into the tourism sector? Will the Minister outline how the £107 million he mentioned in his reply will assist the industry in attracting new staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's question about the provision of funding for language training, that is not necessarily CERT's job. That is an element of the partnership with the industry and it has a large part to play in that regard.</P>
      <P>I supported the industry's budget submission regarding tax breaks to encourage people back into the industry. Many people, including women who may have been involved in voluntary organisations or rearing their children, could come back into the industry. We want those people to return and a certain sector is being attracted back into the industry. Jobs are available in the industry, but it is not the only sector experiencing problems in attracting staff. The IT sector is currently considered lucrative by young people and other sectors are having the same problems as the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The schemes developed by CERT have been exceptionally successful in attracting the people I mentioned and also in disadvantaged areas. For example, in Dublin people found it difficult to get to the training centre in Sheriff Street, but when the centre's facilities were brought out to disadvantaged areas, the programme was filled immediately and there was a 100% success rate in terms of the young people involved getting work. The centre provided training and crèche facilities and it was an amazing success. I hope that can be repeated in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the third part of the question asked by the Deputy concerning initiatives for young people, especially those in disadvantaged areas. They are very encouraged by the way in which CERT handled the targeting of the transition year and leaving certificate students with the new tech<Col N="352" /> nique used recently where there was interaction between young people who had trained as chefs and who were able to get away from that or old idea that it was a poorly paid job. Young chefs or young people entering the industry now are very highly paid and sought after. There is a future for many young people entering the industry now. It is just a matter of getting over that old line of thinking among the people that we were servile for far too long and that we will never be servile again. The service area can be a badge of honour like it is for the French, Italians and the Spanish.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wants a detailed breakdown of how the industry plans to spend the money allocated under the national plan with regard to marketing, the product and how CERT will spend money, I will obtain the relevant information for the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider setting up a charter for the customer? A charter of contract is being set up by the regional tourism offices with Bord Fáilte currently, but we should start with the customer. What plans has the Minister with regard to the lack of basic information on how to recruit people from outside the EU? There is a serious deficit there. I disagree with the Minister. There is a huge language difficulty at the moment. There is also lack of appropriate skills among people employed in the trade and verification of qualifications is a new major problems. What plans has the Minister to deal with the legal, bureaucratic and cultural difficulties now clearly emerging among people from the non-EU countries working here? With regard to the attitude survey to which he referred, there is a great lack of service. There is an awareness that service in the industry is not nearly as good as it was because many people working in the trade are unable to communicate with the customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the latter part of the Deputy's question relates to the rapidity of the success we have achieved over the past ten years. This city and country is becoming increasingly multi-cultural and long may it continue to do so. Regarding the language barrier, some people indicated to me that they would have a problem with language but that is not a matter for the Government or the Government agencies. It is a matter for the individuals to deal with. I point out to the Deputy that this country is renowned for the number of schools available currently to teach the English language. We are now the foremost country in Europe with regard to the English language teaching sector. There are excellent schools and a booming industry in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite all of that, the situation is that if one is in a hotel and orders fish, one could end up getting an omelette. It is no excuse to say that the economic boom is the reason for the inefficiency. It is important that people entering the trade know the business. What plan does the <Col N="353" /> Minister have to ensure that people in the trade can employ suitable people? Regardless of what he said, that is not happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in denial with regard to language training &ndash; it is the greatest problem we have now. We are losing our traditional welcoming attitude. If the people behind the counter or inside the reception desk cannot speak English they cannot give a welcome. Without language training we are going down the wrong road. It is definitely the responsibility of the Minister's Department and I ask him again if he will assist the tourism product with language training for the people whom we are predominantly recruiting abroad. We will recruit 145,000 people over the next five years. What proposals are there? It is the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 17, 33 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in response to another Parliamentary Question today, my purpose in asking the Irish Sports Council to review our participation in the 2000 Olympic Games, is to examine in depth how Ireland went about preparing for, selecting and managing our national participation in Sydney, and the lessons we can learn for Athens 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference I set for the review are designed for this purpose. Specifically, I have asked the Irish Sports Council, following consultation with the relevant bodies and individuals involved, to examine the performance of the key players and their role in the preparation, support and selection of Ireland's team in the 2000 Games, consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of the procedures, arrangements and schemes which applied to the preparation, support and selection of the team, the relationships between the many agencies involved in the prep<Col N="355" /> aration and participation of the team and these aspects to be assessed against international comparators, identify the particular factors which contributed to, or impacted on, the team's performance in Sydney, and report to me on its review, conclusions and recommendations before 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the council, in the light of the review, to recommend a strategy for achieving a significant improvement in the number of national records, finalists and medalists at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, including any changes that would have to take place in relation to critical issues identified under the review. In conducting the review, the council will meet all the key players involved, and invite them to provide written reports.</P>
    <P>As part of this process I recently participated in a meeting with representatives of all the NGBs represented at the Sydney Games where I heard reports by each of the bodies on their experience of the Sydney Games and the factors that impacted on their performance there. I also had a separate meeting with the president and officials of the Olympic Council of Ireland and, as I have already said in reply to an earlier question today, I very much appreciate the Olympic Council's involvement in the review and its contribution to that meeting which will feed into the overall process.</P>
    <P>One of the key players in our preparation for the Sydney Olympics was the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick. As the House is aware, the NCTC was established to provide specialised training for elite sports persons through a system of structured coaching, a comprehensive sports science programme and optimal training facilities, as well as to assist in raising the standard of coaching and the training of coaches. As a key player, the NCTC's role will, of course, be examined under the review. In addition, the centre will, no doubt, have a major and significant contribution to make to the overall task of the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the position whereby the Olympic Council of Ireland received £100,000 in administration grants and £13,000 in grants for inspection visits to Sydney in 1999 and £120,000 in administration grants and £20,000 in grants for inspection visits in 2000 is questionable in the context of the £600,000 reserves of the council? Is the fact that it appears the Olympic Council of Ireland is not a body that conducts its business at the highest level in a democratic fashion not another matter of major concern? These issues are most disturbing as regards the use of taxpayers' money.</P>

I asked about accountability, the selec<Col N="356" /> tion of the teams, management of the team, the continuing care of the athletes, for example, medical care, during the games and questioned it on the democracy of the Olympic committee. I raised the voting issues and the selection process of the president and sought answers to all these questions. In fairness to the council it has agreed to come into the review. There is a process within the members of the Olympic family or council for the 28 governing bodies to bring about change.</P>

      <P>When I hear the Minister talk of the family I always think of the Mafia but this is a different matter. Did the Minister raise with the council the public squabbling that took place and the manner in which the good name of Irish sport was again dragged through the mud in Sydney in a repeat of what happened in Atlanta? Did he raise the very public criticism of himself and his office, the Sports Council and its chief executive, the National Coaching and Training Centre and its role and contribution towards the development and preparation of the team?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Tourism and Sport, of which Deputy Moynihan-Cronin is Chairperson, invited Mr. Hickey to appear before it and he effectively refused to do so? He declined the offer to come before the committee to discuss some of these issues and in a very arrogant way said he had to do his own internal business and discuss matters with team managers before he would appear before any committee.</P>

      <P>I was at a number of functions with the president and members of the Olympic Council. However, I pointed out that I would not turn a blind eye to what went on in Sydney and, therefore, I had this meeting afterwards. I raised the issues the Deputy mentioned. He is correct is saying that I do not have a problem with the NCTC, the Sports Council or the national governing bodies of sport. Although we may have differences regarding funding, we get on very well, as I am sure was the case during the Deputy's term of office, in the interests of Irish sport. There was a difficulty with this body in the past.</P>
      <P>I am aware the select committee has asked the president to appear before it. He has indicated he will send a copy of the report of its review to the committee. That is a matter for it. I would encourage him to come before the committee. Leaders of organisations and public representatives are accountable and the president and Olympic Council is also accountable. As the Deputy stated, a large amount of public funding goes to the Olympic Council and, while I cannot be in any way threatening regarding the council until I see the report, nonetheless we all agree there must be accountability.</P>

      <P>I, too, was disappointed with the reply I received from the president and I hope he will reconsider. The president recently accused the Sports Council of leaving the OCI short of grant aid to the tune of £250,000. What was this application for and when was it made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was part of the OCI strategy for this Olympic year and outlined in detail specific matters that were required. It was gone into in great detail by the Sports Council. An additional £250,000 was sought by the Olympic committee. Taking into consideration the resources of the Olympic council and the fact that the Exchequer provides all the costs of training facilities, accommodation, pre-site training sessions and the costs of people going out to view where the team will be accommodated and the training centres available to them, the Sports Council felt there was no real necessity for the additional funding.</P>

      <P>Ireland's impact on future Olympics is threatened by the reports since the Olympics. I am disappointed the president of the OCI will not come before the select committee, because the perception of the OCI has far-reaching implications. He is waiting for 11 reports before he will give a final report. It is not good enough that he will submit a copy rather than coming in person. The Olympics ended a number of months ago and the reports should be done by now. It is disap<Col N="358" /> pointing that this type of behaviour is going on in a small country. The Minister is the boss with responsibility for disbursing funds. It is time to get tough with these people who must account for the money given to them. I expect the Minister to get the proper reaction from them.</P>

It is a matter for the members of each national organisation to decide how to conduct their business. We cannot tell them what to do. I hope they are all democratically elected. I have made it clear that I have some problems with the way the committee is made up and with the election process. They have agreed to participate in the review and I hope they continue to participate in it. I can only wait to see what the conclusions of that review will be before I meet them again or the president appears before the select committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister asked the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland about the number of accreditations under his control, how they were distributed and who received them? That matter had a considerable impact on the atmosphere prior to the games. Does the Minister know what happened to the accreditations? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of accreditation, which was a problem before the games began, and the council stated that would be part of the review. It also made a robust defence of it. I understand a sub-committee of the select committee will meet athletes who were directly involved in the Olympics. One of the problems is that there are not enough people with experience of the Olympics directly involved. That must be addressed. The accreditation process is important. Coaches are one of the most important groups at the Olympics. On the day of a major event an athlete is closer to his coach than to his mother, father, brother or sister. Most of the athletes agree there is a great dependency on coaches. We must address the issue of who should get accreditation, who were accredited and how the system can be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 9 and 11 on 10 October last, the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, included a provision towards the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling <Col N="360" /> up to 2,000 delegates. In November 1998 the European Commission gave its approval in principle for a grant of 33 million ecu, or £26 million, subject to a number of conditions, including the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules. Subsequently, having secured Commission approval for an extension of the permissible time limits within which the grant could be drawn down, contract documentation was agreed and signed by Bord Fáilte and the developer, Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, by the end of December last year.</P>
    <P>Planning permission for the development issued by Dublin Corporation in August 1999. It was appealed to An Bord Pleanála which, in July last, issued a decision granting planning permission for the national conference centre element of the overall development but not for the bulk of the surrounding development. The developers have been considering their options in light of this planning decision and I have confirmed to them that the public procurement process through which the Spencer Dock proposal emerged and the grant offer of £26 million was made must be adhered to by all the parties to the process. I have asked the developers to continue to consider with Bord Fáilte how to proceed within the context of the terms and conditions of the existing grant offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has progress been made on the development of the national conference centre since I raised this issue in the House some weeks ago? Does the Minister agree that a vital key requirement in the sustainable development of tourism, namely, a national conference centre, is now almost a dead duck? What negotiations or discussions have taken place between Bord Fáilte and the developers since our last discussion in the House on 14 October? What has Bord Fáilte reported back to the Minister about this project? Is the conference centre a dead duck or will it proceed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to a national conference centre. A contract has been signed between Bord Fáilte and Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited. It may have met Bord Fáilte but I met the developers. In the light of the decision by An Bord Pleanála I advised the developers that I wanted an indication on whether they were going to proceed. They have not said yes or no. The contract involving Bord Fáilte remains in force until 31 December. I cannot go beyond its terms because it was provided that the grant of £26 million would be given under specific conditions. That is the current position. It is for the developers to decide, but the Government is fully committed to the national conference centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the developer has four or five weeks to make a decision, that if no decision is made the contract is null and void <Col N="361" /> and the conference centre a dead duck? Does he have a fall-back position? Has he considered any attempt to salvage the RDS project, which he scrapped and which would now be built? Given that we are within four to five weeks from the termination of a contract for a key project for the sustainable development of tourism, does he have an alternative plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no alternative plan, nor will there be while a contract exists between two parties to proceed with the conference centre. It is not a dead duck. The grant aid of £26 million has been secured, subject to the terms and conditions under which it was allocated. If we had proceeded with the RDS proposal it would have reverted to the EU.</P>
      <P>There can be no alternative plan when a contract is in force. Why would an alternative be provided? Planning permission has been granted for the construction of a national conference centre. The developers have until the end of the year to make a decision on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that if the developers decide not to proceed there will be no conference centre, now or in the foreseeable future? Will he explain the snail's pace at which this matter has proceeded over the past two to three years? The Minister lost the run of himself at the outset when he scrapped the RDS project and pursued this one, which is now going slowly up a cul-de-sac.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it would be helpful if this project could proceed independently of, and without being tied to, Treasury Holdings and the Spencer Dock group who, as profiteering speculators, have no regard for the local community? They appear to be motivated solely by greed and the need to maximise their profit rather than by the proper concern for the sustainable development of this traditional docklands area. Does the Minister agree that is the reason the conference centre has not proceeded? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if, at the end of the year, the contract with Spencer Dock is finished or is CIE permanently involved with Treasury Holdings? Most of this site is in State ownership under CIE. Will the Minister also indicate if, at <Col N="362" /> the end of the year, it is possible for the Government to extricate itself from its connection with these property developers and proceed with the development of this site in a sustainable way and in co-operation with the local community?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The docklands area was chosen by an independent project management board as a result of a competition. Three, four or five different developers were involved and the Spencer Dock development was by far the most favoured proposal. It was not the Government but an independent body who chose the docklands area as a site for the centre. The Government is committed to ensuring that the docklands site is developed, I hope with the co-operation of the local community.</P>
      <P>A contract has been signed between Bord Fáilte and the Spencer Dock developers which is due to expire at the end of the year. I cannot comment on a contract where the developers have not indicated whether they will or will not proceed. With regard to the CIE site, there is ongoing discussion on the nature of the contract that has been signed between CIE and the developers. It is for the legal people involved to decide what happens if the developers do not proceed. It is a legal matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is incorrect to say that if the RDS development had proceeded we would have lost £26 million of EU funding. Does he stand over that and, if so, will he explain what he means? There is still no conference centre in the docklands area, the grant aid of £26 million available from the EU has been diverted elsewhere and the centre is now dependent on Exchequer funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refresh the Deputy's memory. When the RDS was involved in the process there was a legal objection by members of the consortium involved, which had to be decided at EU level. The indications from the EU were that the other consortia involved had a legal point in fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>In such circumstances the RDS project would not have proceeded. I did not scupper the RDS, it was a matter for the EU. If we had not done something a time limit would have been imposed and we would not have been able to secure the funding of £26 million. The Deputy is aware that this funding was not lost. It was not returned to the EU because it was legitimately diverted to another project.</P>

      <P>If there is no legal notice of a termination of a contract an extension can be sought. Is there an extension of the 31 December deadline on this contract and do the developers have a legal right to seek an extension? It would be unwise for a contract of this size not to contain such a provision. Is the Minister aware of this?</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has no alternative plan. It looks bad if the Spencer Dock developers bring the Minister to the deadline on this contract without making any commitments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 32 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I should point out that this reply is similar to a reply to a priority question which I read into the record earlier. If Deputies are agreeable, I am prepared to answer supplementary questions. I do not wish to waste their time by reading a similar reply to that of an earlier question.</P>

      <P>For various reasons, the traditional British tourist is no longer coming to Ireland although the British market is on our doorstep. Does the Minister agree that we need to develop new tourism products to attract people to Ireland and does he have any proposals in this regard? New tourism products are required to attract people, who used to visit Ireland previously, back into the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the British market is very important to Ireland. The strength of sterling has certainly contributed to our problems in this regard. Recent indicators show that there was a slump in this area for a certain period last year but that the situation has since improved. The feedback from people in the industry who attended the recent World Trade Fair indicates that 2000 has been the best year yet in terms of the British market. We still have a lot to offer this market.</P>
      <P>I agree that the future of the industry lies in the provision of new tourism products. The national development plan includes an allocation of £100 million for product development &ndash; £60 million for the S&amp;E region and £40 million for the BMW region. Quite a large proportion of this funding will be directed towards the provision of major attractions in these areas, particularly areas which have not reaped the benefits of tourism development. I envisage that the money will be spent on major attractions or clusters of attractions which will result in visitors coming to these regions.</P>

      <P>What has been achieved under the national development plan to date? The plan is referred to all the time but I would be concerned <Col N="365" /> to see proof on the ground that something is actually happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that sterling was acting as a hindrance to us but it should be seen as a benefit in that people from Northern Ireland and the UK are gaining 25% on exchange rates. It is very discouraging to hear that this has not been of any benefit to date. The Minister also referred to the excellent reports from the trade fair. How many promoters from the north-west and Border regions would not concur with that opinion? People who have major vested interests in the region have indicated that this year has been one of the worst seasons to date.</P>

      <P>The strength of sterling can have a number of effects. County Donegal has not benefited from the exchange rate. Many people from Northern Ireland, who represent an essential element of our domestic market, visited the western and north-western regions, in particular, in the past. These people are still crossing the Border&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the financial markets. Sterling has a role to play throughout the European zone and its effects are felt in all EU countries. We must be very mindful of the low fare access to this country. British tourists now have more options open to them in terms of low access companies which can transfer them to a variety of destinations. This is one of the key areas in which we have lost out.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in a position of power; can he not resolve that problem in conjunction with his Cabinet colleagues? Perhaps people could be encouraged to travel into regional airports such as Derry, Knock etc. which, as the poor relations, cannot do anything to promote tourism. Aer Rianta has this entire matter sewn up. What does the Minister intend to do about the access problem?</P>

      <P>A high percentage of visitors come into Ireland on the east coast. I cannot simply go out to Dublin Airport and direct them to various destinations throughout the country. People can freely decide where to go and we cannot drag them by the scruff of the neck to the north-west, south-east or wherever. If we develop new tourism attractions in these regions, people will be encouraged to visit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> The Deputy should remember that we are just getting over 30 years of political instability. People in Northern Ireland and other areas in the north are beginning to feel the positive effects of that. Annual funding of some £20 million has been secured under the national development plan for marketing, something which was previously unheard of. The North-South company held its first meeting recently and I have received total co-operation from my counterpart, the tourism Minister, Reg Empey, in Northern Ireland. Mr. Empey is a businessman who realises that £2.7 billion in tourism revenue has come into this country and he is determined that all parts of the country should benefit in this area. I am confident that the initiatives being undertaken will benefit all areas of the country.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar bun tráthnóna agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh le Coiste na Gaeilge san Oireachtas a mhol go mbeadh a leithéid de dhíospóireacht ann.

      <P>Is féidir liom na nótaí a scaipeadh. Caithfidh mé a rá, sa chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí sa Teach seo go minic agus rudaí scríofa amach roimh ré ag daoine, nach díospóireacht a bhíonn sa Teach níos mó ach daoine ag seasamh suas ag tabhairt réamh-ráitis agus creidim féin gur measa i bhfad cúrsaí díospóireachta sa Teach seo ó tharla na ráitis a bheith scríofa. Bheadh sé chomh maith iad ar fad a leagaint isteach sa leabharlann agus gan bacaint le bheith ag labhairt sa Teach seo ar chor ar bith.</P>
      <P>Ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht tá na céimeanna seo leanas tógtha. San Acht Oideachais tá foráil an-láidir i gcúrsaí Gaeilge agus tá dream daoine le bunú faoin Acht sin a thabharfaidh aire do chúrsaí oideachais tré Ghaeilge agus do chúrsaí mhúineadh na Gaeilge go ginearálta.</P>
      <P>San Acht Pleanála a achtaíodh le gairid tá forálacha an-láidir ann don chéad uair riamh maidir le caomhnú na teanga sa Ghaeltacht. Ní raibh sé sin ann cheana agus dá uireasa bhí sé ag déanamh go leor dochair go mór mhór i nGaeltachtaí ar imeall cathrach ar nos Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe.</P>
      <P>Tháinig Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta isteach. Go deimhin bhí dhá Acht Údarás ann agus faoin Acht sin deineadh athrú ó bhun ar an Údarás. Deineadh níos daonlathaí é agus tugadh forlámhas níos mó do phobal na Gaeltachta ar a ngnótha féin.</P>
      <P>Tháinig Acht isteach maidir le bunú Foras Teanga, Foras na Gaeilge mar chuid de sin. Faoin Acht sin tugadh stádas don Ghaeilge nach raibh riamh cheana aici sa tír sa mhéid is go bhfuil deighleáil le cúrsaí Gaeilge anois mar chuid lárnach de ghnótha Thuaidh is Theas. Bhí sé ar cheann den sé Fhoras tosaigh a bunaíodh faoi Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá méadú mór tagtha ar chaiteachas ar bhunstructúr na Gaeltachta. Is rud fíor-thábhachtach é sin mar bhí sé de thuairim láidir ag pobal na Gaeltachta gurb ionann an seasamh a bhí ag an nGaeilge agus bunstructúr na Gaeltachta a bhí thar a bheith lag. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil éirithe liom deireadh a chur leis an scéal sin tré tabhairt faoi bhunstructúr den scoth a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht. Tá feabhas curtha ar scéimeanna <Col N="368" /> Gaeltachta uilig, Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge agus Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh scéim náisiúnta Gaeltachta do chuntóirí teanga mar go bhfuil fadhb sa Ghaeltacht faoi láthair maidir le gasúir atá á dtógáil le Béarla ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile agus bhí gá le cúnamh sna scoileanna. Bunaíodh Coiste Comhairleach na nÓg, coiste do dhaoine óga sa Ghaeltacht atá ag cur comhairle orm maidir le polasaithe dóibh agus a bheidh ag foilsiú tuarascála go luath san athbhliain. Bhunaigh an Rialtas Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, an chéad uair riamh gur breathnaíodh go sonrach ar cheist na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ag Coimisiún ar bith. Bhí fíor ghá leis sin agus is rud é a dhéanfaidh an-difríocht.</P>
    <P>Tá obair an-mhór ar bun maidir le Bille Teanga a réiteach. Tá súil agam an Bille seo a fhoilsiú an bhliain seo chugainn. Ag réiteach an Bhille caithfear a thuiscint gur reachtaíocht as an nua ar fad atá i gceist anseo agus mar is eol do na Teachtaí a bhí in a nAirí tá obair an-mhór i gceist chun Bille ar bith a réiteach. Go deimhin féin faoin am a fhágfaidh an Rialtas seo oifig beidh níos mó reachtaíocht faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht curtha tríd Tithe an Oireachtais le linn a dtréimhse oifige ná mar a cuireadh tríd san iomlán ón mbliain 1956 i leith.</P>
    <P>Tháinig an Coimisiún Logainmneacha anonn go dtí an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán agus leis an athrú sin tá sé i gceist tabhairt faoin cheist sin ar fad agus cinnte a dhéanamh de go ndéanfar caomhnú ar logainmneacha traidisiúnta na tíre. Ar deireadh, tá méadú nach beag curtha ar an airgead atá curtha ar fáil do TG4 agus freisin tá curtha go mór le huaireannta craolta Raidio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Le bunú Fhoras na Gaeilge is dóigh liom go bhfuil ceann de na céimeanna is tábhachtaí i saol na Gaeilge tógtha. Den chéad uair beidh polasaí cuimsitheach Gaeilge, agus airgead dá réir á chur leis, á fheidhmiú taobh ó thuaidh agus ó dheas den teorainn. Beidh an Ghaeilge á láimhseáil anois ar bhonn Uile-Éireann as seo amach. De bharr go raibh sé ar cheann den sé Fhoras tosaigh a bunaíodh tugann sé stádas nach beag don Ghaeilge agus cuirfidh sé go mór le saol na Gaeilge amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, níl aon mhaitheas sna hiarrachtaí iomlán ag an Stát muna mbeidh de thoradh ar sin go gcuirfimid níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt i measc an phobail go ginearálta. Ceann de na rudaí go gcaithfear díriú air ná féachaint cén chaoi is féidir tógáil anois go stuama ar an obair íontach atá ar bun ag na pobail éagsúla gaelscoileanna ar fud na tíre. Cén chaoi is féidir linn an fáinne fí a bhí ann ariamh maidir leis an Ghaeilge a bhriseadh, sé sin an fáinne fí go bhfoghlaimíonn go leor daoine an Ghaeilge sa scoil, bíonn ard-chumas sa teanga acu ag fágáil na scoile dóibh agus deich mbliana i ndiaidh sin ceal úsáide bíonn an teanga dearmadtha acu.</P>
    <P>Creidim féin gurb é ceann de na rudaí is mó go gcaithfimid breathnú air taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ná cén chaoi is féidir linn, bunaithe <Col N="369" /> timpeall ar leithéidí na ngaelscoileanna agus eagrais eile Ghaeilge, pobail bheo Ghaeilge a bhunú in a mbeidh deiseanna ag daoine an Ghaeilge a úsáid go laethúil agus go mbeidh gréasáin de chainteoirí Gaeilge ann a mbeidh deis acu an Ghaeilge a labhairt go rialta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí Gaeltachta is dóigh liom anois go gcaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt ar na fadhbanna. Níl aon amhras faoi ach go bhfuil brú nach beag curtha ag institúidí stáit, ag an imirce agus ag easpa deiseanna fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht ar an bpobal ann. Sin é an fáth go bhfuil go leor de phobal na Gaeltachta anois, fiú amháin iad siúd a bhfuil Gaeilge ó dhúchas acu, ag labhairt an Bhearla mar chéad theanga. Tuigim dóibh agus tuigim na cuinsí stairiúla a bhaineann leis seo. Is gnó do Choimisiún na Gaeltachta na h-údair sin a scrúdú agus féachaint cén leigheas atá orthu. Cinneadh pobail a bheidh ann sa deireadh ach is féidir leis an Stát tionchar mór a imirt ar na roghanna a bheidh ag an phobal. Creidim má fheiceann an pobal gurb é a leas Gaeilge a labhairt le gasúir mar go mbeidh Béarla acu ar aon chaoi, go ndéanfaidh siad é sin.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rudaí gur mhaith liomsa a fheiceáil ná go ndíreoimid go mór ar fheachtas agus is é a bheadh mar mhanna ar an fheachtas sin ná Gaeilge ón gcliabhán. Sé sin le rá go ndéanfaimis iarracht a chur in a luí orthu siúd a bhfuil Gaeilge acu go bhfuil gach buntáiste, agus níl aon mhíbhuntáiste, déanamh cinnte má tá an Ghaeilge acu go labhróidh siad í mar chéad theanga le gasúir. Dá ndéanfaí é sin ní bheadh aon amhras faoi ní hamháin go dtiocfadh an Ghaeltacht slán ach go bhfásfadh sí agus go mbeadh forás uirthi sna blianta amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Chuige sin tá athrú polasaí iomlán ag teastáil. Ceann de na ceisteanna a ritheann liom ná cén fáth nach n-éiríonn linn níos mó de thionscail na Gaeltachta a bhunú ar an mbun-acmhainn amháin atá ag an Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil in áit ar bith eile sa tír agus sé sin an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail.</P>
    <P>Bhí comhráití agam le gairid le Cathaoirleach agus feidhmeannaigh sinsearacha Údarás na Gaeltachta agus phlé mé an cheist leo gur chreid mé go mba cheart go mbeadh athrú mór polasaí ann agus go mbunófaí i bhfad níos mó postanna ard-chaighdeán sa Ghaeltacht a d'úsáidfeadh an Ghaeilge mar bhun-acmhainn le haghaidh na bpostanna sin. Tá postanna san oideachas i gceist, sa tsláinte, i gcúrsaí áirnéis agus i seirbhísiú eagraíochtaí nuair a bheidh an tAcht Teanga ann i gceist. Tá postanna i gcúrsaí dílárnaithe, i dturasóireacht, i gcúram leanaí i gceist. San iomlán creidim go bhféadfaí suas agus anuas le míle post a chruthú ach cur chuige idir na heairneála ar fad atá ag plé leis an Ghaeltacht agus ní ag an Údarás amháin. Postanna d'ardchaighdeán atá i gceist a bheadh bunaithe ar an teanga. Dá ndéanfaí é sin seachas an rud a bhí ag tárlú go dtí seo maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge bheadh na postanna seo ag coinneáil daoine le hard-oideachas sa bhaile agus bheadh na postanna ina dtacú iad féin don Ghae<Col N="370" /> ilge. Bhí gá le go leor de na postana a bhí á gcruthú chun daoine a choimead sa bhaile ach bhí siad ag imirt tionchar diúltach ar chúrsaí teanga sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Chonaic muid mar shampla an leas a rinne na postanna a cruthaigh TG4. Tá sé le feiceáil go soiléir chomh fada ó bhaile le Rinn Ó gCuanach, Tír Chonaill, Connemara agus Corca Dhuibhne. Chonaic muid an obair iontach agus an tionchar dearfach ar fad a bhí ar chruthú postanna&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ar deireadh, agus is oth liom nach bhfuil níos mó ama againn agus tuigim go bhfuil an t-am teoranta agus go bhfuil Teachtaí eile ag iarraidh labhairt ar an ábhar seo, fáiltím roimh na Teachtaí eile agus is rud an-mhaith é go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar bun.</P>
      <P>Go minic bíonn easpa misnigh ar dhaoine ó thaobh na teanga de ach chuile áit go dtéim sa tír thuaidh agus theas go bhfuil den chéad uair gréasán de phobal á thógáil de bharr deiseanna cumarsáide nua theicneolaíochta, de bharr TG4, Raidio na Gaeltachta, telefóin agus araoile. Ní gá don phobal sin a bheith ag cónaí taobh le taobh. Leis na céimeanna ar fad atá á dtógáil i láthair na huaire agus céimeanna eile go gcaithfimid a bheartú creidim nach gá dúinn a bheith imníoch go bhfaighidh an Ghaeilge bás. An cheist atá ann ná cé chomh scioptha is a thiocfaidh forás ar an Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre.</P>
      <P>Ar deireadh ar fad, má chreideann muid a mhalairt níl le déanamh ach breathnú ar leithéidí Bhéal Feirste, áit nach raibh traidisiún láidir Gaeilge ann agus an chaoi a bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo anois i measc an phobail ansin agus an obair mhór atá déanta.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois agus an t-aonú céad is fiche buailte linn tá sé réasúnta simplí buanna agus laígí na Gaeilge mar mhion-teanga a aithint. Tá cúrsaí teanga sa Ghaeltacht ag dul in olcas go tapaidh mar is léir d'aon chuairteoir ach tá súil agam gurb é tuar dóchais Coimisiún na Gaeltachta a thabharfaidh deis do mhuintir na Gaeltachta cur síos a dhéanamh ar a scéalta féin agus a leigheasanna a thabhairt ar na rudaí atá ag goilliúint orthu. Is fiú a lua gurb í an Ghaeltacht, is dócha, an t-aon fhoinse atá againn don teanga bheo agus má thiteann sí le fána ní bheidh aon ní le cur ina h-áit. <Col N="371" /> Ritheann sé liom nach dtuigeann an córas rialtais lárnach an méid sin agus mar an gcéanna an córas deonach, airgeadaithe ag an stát, a bhfuil a chuid gníomhaíochtaí sa Gaeltacht gann go leor.</P>
    <P>Beidh mórán ag braith ar an gCoimisiún mar sin agus molaim do lucht na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe chomh maith leis na húdaráis stáit agus leathstáit ról cuimsitheach a ghlacadh sa phróiséas iomlán mar tá mórán le tuilleamh agus mórán eile fós le caillíuint. Cuimhnigh ar fhochlaibh ceann de mhór scoláirí na Gaeilge, Osborn Bergin &ldquo;no language has ever been revived and no language ever will be revived&rdquo;. Séard a bhí i gceist aige ná aon teanga a cailleadh mar ghnáthurlabhra níor bhain sí stadas mar sin amach arís agus is dócha le heiseamlár na hEabhraise do bhí an ceart aige. Ábhar machnaimh dúinn go léir é sin gan amhras.</P>
    <P>Tá comharthaí dearfa áirithe le feiscint mórthimpeall na tíre i gcoitinne chomh fada agus a bhaineann siad leis an nGaeilge agus an chultúr Gaeilge. Tá TG4 againn, tá gluaiseacht na ngaelscoileanna agus comórtas Ghlór na nGael. Tá TG4 le moladh ach is léir go bhfuil sí faoi bhrú mór airgid. Ní gá ach súil a chaitheamh ar an amchlár chun é sin a thuiscint go háirithe nuair a fheiceann duine líon na gclár nach bhfuil baint ar bith acu le Gaeilge agus fiú na cláracha sin le Gaeilge a cuireadh le chéile ar bheagán airgid. Caithfimid beart do réir ár mbriathar a dhéanamh agus buiséad réadúil a bhronnadh ar TG4 go háirithe nuair atá airgead flúirseach i bpócaí an stáit.</P>
    <P>Tá ról tábhachtach ag na gaelscoileanna ár ndóigh ach an bhfuil slite múinte oiriúnacha acu go léir ? Tá fhios agam féin mar shampla go dtéann sé an-dian i gcónaí ar ranna stáit, ar údaráis áitiúla agus ar eagrais eile beag agus mór daoine le Gaeilge líofa a earcú agus ní leigheas é aon Bhille Teanga ar fhadhb bhunúsach mar sin.</P>
    <P>Mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste Oireachtais um Oidhreacht agus an Ghaeilge tá suim ar leith agam i labhairt na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais. Mar thús áfach, bíonn mórán seafóide le cloisint nuair a bhíonn cur síos ar an nGaeilge nó easpa Gaeilge sa Dáil. Is ionann an tOireachtas agus gach aon phobal eile sa tír sa mhéid is go mbíonn daoine le raidhse Gaeilge agus daoine eile fós ar bheagán ach rud comónta don dá dhream bíonn easpa taithí agus easpa muiníne ag goilliúint orthu go léir agus tá fhios agam gurb amhlaidh an scéal ar gach taobh den Teach seo. Tá gá le comhairle, tacaíocht agus lámh chúnta againn go léir ach is fiú a lua go dtagann líofacht le cleachtadh. Tá gá chomh maith le ról níos dearfa ó na páirtithe éagsula agus cúnamh ó na hoifigí preasa chun óraidí a scaipeadh.</P>
    <P>I in no way regard this statement here this afternoon as being divisive or party political. We are at one in seeking a proper place for the Irish Language amongst the community of the people of Ireland. It has survived much over the centuries &ndash; war, famine, colonisation and religion. Tá sé de dhualgas orainn an solas, a shíolraíonn ó na mílaoiseanna atá caite, a choinneáil beo agus <Col N="372" /> oidhreacht na nglúnta sin atá imithe romhainn a chaomhnú.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo. Is trua nach bhfuil níos mó ama againn. Níos lú ná leathuair atá againn ach bíonn gach tosnú lag. Le cúnamh Dé beidh díospóireachtaí eile ar an Ghaeilge agus ar athbheochan na Gaeilge againn amach anseo.</P>
      <P>An rud is mó a dheineann buartha domhsa ná nach bhfuil cuspóir chruinn againn i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Is é sin an bhfuil sé mar chuspóir againn an teanga a athbheochan mar chéad theanga na tíre nó go mbeadh tír dhátheangach againn. Is dóigh liomsa gurb é an dara ceann an cuspóir is ceart a bheith againn agus go ndéarfaimis é sin agus nach mbeadh aon náire orainn é sin a rá. Sin an chéad rud.</P>
      <P>Sé an cuspóir an chéad rud. Ansin caithfear an straitéis agus an polasaí a leagadh amach chun an cuspóir sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Sin locht a fhaighim ar an státseirbhís agus ar an Rialtas seo ach ní theastaíonn uaim a bheith ag gearán nó a bheith diúltach leis an Rialtas.</P>
      <P>An rud is tábhachtaí ná go mbeadh straitéis ag an Rialtas ag dul trasna ar na Ranna Stáit éagsúla, ar na húdaráis phoiblí agus ar gach gné den tír gur féidir ceist athbheochan na Gaeilge, an tír dhátheangach, a bhrú ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>Tá an straitéis sin thar a bheith tábhachtach mar ní féidir cuspóir a chur i gcríoch muna mbíonn cuspóir lánsoiléir againn agus muna mbíonn an straitéis ann ní féidir an dul ar aghaidh a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Rud atá an-tábhachtach freisin ná go gcaithfimid a chur ina luí ar mhuintir na hÉireann gur leo an teanga. Go dtí seo tharla sé go raibh daoine a raibh an-chruinneas sa Ghaeilge acu agus b'fhéidir go raibh elitism ann, rud nár chabhraigh le gnáthdhaoine a gcumas sa Ghaeilge a fhorbairt.</P>
      <P>Mar sin tá an cuspóir agus an straitéis thar a bheith tábhachtach. Ach muna mbíonn muintir na hÉireann sásta glacadh leis an chuspóir agus leis an straitéis fanfaidh an scéal mar atá nó rachaidh sé in olcas.</P>
      <P>Creidim nach dtarlóidh sé sin má déantar rud atá an-tábhachtach ar fad agus is é sin an pobal go léir a mhealladh isteach i ndíospóireacht maidir leis an Ghaeilge. Is dóigh liomsa má chuireann an Rialtas chuige an cuspóir seo a ainmniú agus a leathnú &ndash; sé sin gur tír dhátheangach atá uainn &ndash;  agus ansin an straitéis a chur síos ar pháipéar agus go mbeadh sé in aon cháipéis amháin, tabharfaidh sé sin spreagadh éigin don díospóireacht atá ar intinn agam.</P>
      <P>An rud atá an-tábhachtach d'aon dream a mbíonn pleanáil straitéiseach ar siúl acu ná taighde den chéad scoth a dhéanamh ar mheon na ndaoine. Caithfear dul amach agus taighde a dhéanamh i measc na ndaoine i gcoitinne faoi cad a cheapann siad faoin nGaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má chuireann tú an cheist ar fhormhór na ndaoine an ceart an Ghaeilge a athbheochan déarfaidh siad gur cheart é a dhéanamh. Ní bhíonn ann ach caint agus ní dhéanfaidh siad aon <Col N="373" /> rud in a dhiaidh sin. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil easpa ceannaireachta ann. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach díospóireacht a chur ar siúl agus ní hé seo an chéad uair a dúirt mé é sin leis an Aire Stáit.</P>
    <P>An chéad cheist atá le freagairt ná an dteastaíonn uainn an Ghaeilge a athbheochan. An dteastaíonn uainn go mbeadh tír dhátheangach againn? Ceapaim má chuirimid an cheist sin go hoscailte agus go macánta go mbeidh freagra dearfach ar ais. Sin céim mhór. Má tá daoine ann gan suim acu sa Ghaeilge &ndash; agus tá daoine gan suim acu san athbheochan nó i dtír dhátheangach &ndash; is ceart dúinn iad sin a mhealladh chun a dtuairimí a nochtadh agus chun díospóireacht mhacánta a bheith againn. Mar ní fiú an díospóireacht a bheith ann muna mbíonn sé macánta, muna mbíonn sé oscailte agus muna dtugann sé faoi na ceisteanna práinneacha ar fad.</P>
    <P>An dara ceist ná cén fáth a bhfuil sé tábhachtach an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt agus i ndeireadh na dála teacht ar an lá go mbeidh tír dhátheangach againn.  Chun é sin a shoiléiriú tá na logainmneacha cuir i gcás an-tábhachtach. Tá stair gach áit ar fud na tíre fite fuaite leis na logainmneacha agus sin áit an-mhaith le tosú le suim daoine sa Ghaeilge a spreagadh agus iad a bhrú ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Sin smaoineamh amháin ach go dtí go nglacfaidh muintir na hÉireann seilbh ar an teanga, go dtí go dtuigeann siad gur leo féin í agus nach mbaineann sí le haon elite, ní bheidh an lá linn.</P>
    <P>Is ceart dúinn eolas a thabhairt don phobal i gcoitinne faoi na rudaí atá ag tarlú, mar shampla Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, na Billí faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an Bille Comhionnais Teanga. Ar shlí coimeadtar na rudaí sin ina rún. Bimid ag caint mar gheall orthu anseo ach ní leathnaíonn an t-eolas amach go dtí an pobal, taobh amuigh de dhaoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht agus de dhaoine a bhfuil suim acu cheana féin sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>An job atá againne ná an tromlach den phobal nach bhfuil gníomhach san athbheochan a mhealladh isteach sa díospóireacht agus an cuspóir a dhíol leo. Ba cheart iad a mhealladh isteach chun a bheith páirteach sa straitéis a lua mé roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom i ndeireadh na dála rud a rá faoi TG4. Bhí scannán ar TG4 faoi dhó i rith na Nollag faoi Thalamh an Éisc. Bhí an-bhaint i gcónaí ag muintir Phortláirge le Talamh an Éisc. Ní raibh mórán airgid ag na daoine a chuir an clár sin le chéile ach bhí an clár ar fheabhas ó thaobh na Gaeilge, ó thaobh staire agus mar sin de.</P>

      <P>Mar fhocal scoir, an cheist a chuirim ar an Aire Stáit ná an bhfuil seisean sásta dul ar ais go dtí an Rialtas agus a rá ar an gcéad dul síos go gcaithfimid an cuspóir seo, sé sin tír dhátheangach atá uainn, a rá amach go soiléir díreach. Má thagann sé sin ón díospóireacht seo <Col N="374" /> is dóigh liom go mbeidh rud éigin an-tábhachtach bainte amach againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr Sargent Mr Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Gura míle maith agat. Cuirim fáilte is fiche roimh an díospóireacht seo. Tá meas agam ar an Aire Stáit mar dhuine a choimeadann ceist na Gaeilge beo agus a d'oibrigh ar son na Gaeilge ar feadh a shaoil. Rinne a shean-athair agus a shean-mháthair neart ar son na Gaeilge chomh maith. Rugadh Sinéad de Valera i mBaile Brigín, mo bhaile dúchais féin.</P>
      <P>É sin ráite ceapaim gur chineál óráid Ard-Fheise atá cloiste againn ón Aire, agus cuireann sé sin díomá orm. Cheap mé ag tús na seachtaine go mbeadh tuairisc os ár gcomhair amach don aois nua agus inniu tugaim gur ráiteas atá againn seachas tuairisc. Sin a bhí scríofa. B'fhéidir go bhfuilim naive faoi sin ach creidim i rudaí atá scríofa agus a thagann ón Rialtas ó am go chéile.</P>
      <P>Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ann agus is féidir linn dul ar aghaidh ón bpointe sin. Mar a dúirt Conradh na Gaeilge, tír gan teanga, tír gan anam. Agus is cineál macasamhail den tír í an Dáil. Agus má tá muide gan Gaoluinn anseo is baolach go bhfuil an tír ag dul sa treo céanna.</P>
      <P>Mar Ghlasach, ceist eiceolaíoch is ea ceist na teanga domsa. Tá an teanga cosúil le gné den dúlra a bheadh i mbaol, rud luachmhar atá mar chuid chuimsitheach d'éagsúlacht an tsaoil.</P>
      <P>Sula gcuirimid straitéis le chéile don aois seo chugainn is ceart dúinn féachaint siar féachaint cad iad na ceachtanna atá foghlamtha againn ón iarracht atá déanta go dtí seo an Ghaoluinn a chur chun cinn. Is ceart buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine go léir a d'oibrigh san earnáil dheonach  &ndash; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus dreamanna ar nós na gluaiseachta gaelscolaíochta, TG4, na nuachtáin agus na hirisí Gaeilge agus neart eile a dhein gaisce thar na mblianta.</P>
      <P>Ach ó thaobh an Rialtais, ghlacfadh go leor daoine leis go raibh an iomad béime ar scolaíocht go dtí seo chun an Ghaoluinn a choimeád beo. San Iosrael, mar shampla, bhí polasaí i bhfad níos cuimsithí ná scolaíocht amháin acu chun a dteanga féin a thabhairt thar n-ais agus d'éirigh leo.</P>
      <P>Bíonn go leor botúin ar na comharthaí bóthair chomh maith. Drochcheacht í sin do dhuine ar bith atá ag foghlaim na Gaoluinne nó a bhfuil suim acu in oidhreacht na tíre. Tá ceacht le foghlaim againn freisin ó mhuintir Cheanada mar a bhfuil siad dáiríre mar gheall ar an dá theanga oifigiúil.</P>
      <P>Tá an-suim agam i liricí amhráin, i liricí Gaeilge agus in aistriúcháin ar liricí Béarla. D'fhéadfadh an stát cabhrú leis an ngné seo a bheadh an-torthúil i ndeireadh na dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cad tá romhainn? Is gá féachaint ar cheist na Gaeilge agus ar lucht na Gaeilge mar a d'fhéachfaí ar mhionlach ar bith, is cuma an an lucht taistil nó daoine le míchumas nó lucht creidimh áirithe atá i gceist againn. Má táimid dáiríre mar gheall ar an dátheangachas caithfear <Col N="375" /> cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt dóibh. B'fhéidir go gciallaíonn sé sin níos mó infheistíochta nó níos mó a dhéanamh ar a son, ach sin an praghas atá ar chothrom na Féinne mar ghlacaimid leis go gcaithfidh an dá theanga a bheith beo. Níl aon bhaol ar an mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte go gcuirfidh Bille na Gaeilge brú ar go leor daoine agus eagraíochtaí agus is ceart sin mar ní bheidh aon athrú ann gan brú. Ach tá leigheas ag teastáil agus ní chuirfidh sé seo aon leigheas ar fáil. Don leigheas, tá tosaíocht ag teastáil go géar agus ní mór dúinn tosú sa Teach seo trí Ghaoluinn a labhairt. Is gá tosaíocht don Ghaoluinn ó dhaoine atá go mór i mbéal an phobail &ndash; ceoltóirí mar shampla. Dá mbeadh amhrán Gaeilge ag U2 bheadh i bhfad níos mó suime ag daoine sa teanga, is cuma cé mhéad óráid a thugtar faoi anseo sa Dáil. Tá roinnt déanta ag an lucht gnó  &ndash; Toyota agus Superquinn &ndash; ach tá i bhfad níos mó le déanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam nach féidir Déanta in Éirinn a rá níos mó de bharr rialacha an Aontais Eorpaigh ach is féidir go mbeadh ár gcuid pacáistíocht dátheangach agus iarraim ar lucht gnó é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Mar a luaigh an tAire Stáit cuirfidh a leithéid de dhul chun cinn fostaíocht ar fáil &ndash; i bhfad níos mó gaelscoileanna, nuachtán laethúil do lucht na Gaeilge, ollscoil Ghaeilge agus tuilleadh cláir agus ranganna d'fhoghlaimeoirí na Gaeilge. Bhí siad sin ann cheana agus tá gá leo arís.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach mbeidh an Ghaoluinn riamh ina teanga oibre san Aontas Eorpach ach is féidir linn cur leis an méid Gaoluinne a bheas ag teastáil agus a bheas in úsáid san Aontas. Chruthódh sé sin fostaíocht do dhaoine ag teacht ó ghaelscoileanna mar rachaidh a gcuid Gaoluinne i léig muna mbíonn cleachtadh acu.</P>
    <P>Tá gá le Bille na Gaeilge agus cuirfimid fáilte roimhe nuair a thiocfaidh sé. Ar a laghad beidh sé ann ach ní leor é. Tá gá le straitéis nua a leagan amach agus b'fhéidir go bhfuilimid ag cur tús leis sin inniu. Níl aon amhras ach go mbeidh straitéis ag teastáil a leagfaidh amach na cuspóirí atá romhainn mar thír dhátheangach. Ba cheart airgead a infheistiú sna Gaeltachtaí agus i labhairt na Gaoluinne má táimid dáiríre mar gheall air. Muna bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoi, ní fiú é agus beifear ag caitheamh anuas orainn mar dhream a dheireann rud amháin agus a dheineann rud eile. Ní thugann sé sin aon chreidiúint dúinn mar thír nó mar phobal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Cosúil leis na Teachtaí eile tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil seans againn ceist na Gaeilge a phlé inniu sa Dáil. Más mall is mithid agus déanaim comhghairdeachas le Cathaoireacht an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge a spreag an díospóireacht seo nuair a chuir sé an rún síos ar Chlár na Dála. Ní ró-mhinic a bhíonn deis againn staid na teanga a phlé anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agus muid beagáinín taobh istigh de thairseach na haonú aoise is fiche is tráthúil dúinn féachaint ar staid reatha na teanga agus ar a bhfuil i ndán di <Col N="376" /> sa chéad atá amach romhainn. Tá sé dlisteanach a rá má tharlaíonn an cúlú céanna i gcás na teanga sa chéad atá amach romhainn is a tharla sa chéad deiridh is beag Gaeilge a bheas fágtha sa Ghaeltacht, ar a laghad.</P>
    <P>Tá comharthaí dóchais agus comharthaí éadóchais le feiceáil agam maidir leis an nGaeilge. Tá an chuid is mó de na comharthaí éadóchais le feiceáil sa Ghaeltacht féin agus an chuid is mó de na comharthaí dóchais le feiceáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, i gceantracha eile ar fud na tíre. Nuair a bhreathnaím ar a bhfuil ag tarlú sa Ghaeltacht le glúin nó dhó anuas chím go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag cúlú agus faoi bhrú de shíor. Chím go bhfuil níos mó foinn ar dhaoine óga an Béarla a labhairt agus má fhéachtar ar an uimhir scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht a chuireann isteach ar dheontas labhairt na teanga, ní déarfadh duine ar bith go bhfuil líon na scoileanna sin ag dul in airde, ach a mhalairt. Nuair a amharctar ar sin is cinnte gur ábhar éadóchais roinnt mhaith dá bhfuil ag tarlú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid den locht orainn féin nach dtugaimid an dea-shampla i gcónaí le labhairt agus le húsáid na teanga. Tá beartais, agus coimisiúin, agus billí, agus deontais agus rudaí eile ann. Ach mar cheannairí pobail ní minic a thugaimid féin an dea-shampla, anseo nó in áiteacha eile agus téann sé sin ina luí ar an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Sa Ghaeltacht tá go leor de na seirbhísí stáit dá gcur ar fáil trí Bhéarla. Is ábhar scanaill agus éadóchais é go bhfuil eagraíochtaí stáit ann anois a éilíonn nuair a bhíonn imeachtaí poiblí ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht go gcaithfidh siad a bheith i mBéarla. Agus má theastaíonn ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta go mbeadh siad i nGaeilge caithfear an t-eolas a chur isteach timpeall trí seachtaine roimh ré. Tá an dearcadh ag teacht amach má tá duine fá choinne gnó a dhéanamh leis an stáit go mbeidh toradh níos fearr ar do chuid oibre má dhéanann tú i mBéarla seachas i nGaeilge é.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh dóchas a bheith againn chomh maith. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit tá rudaí maithe ag tarlú taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí &ndash; na gaelscoileanna, TG4. Raidió na Gaeltachta, na hirisí, na coláistí samhraidh agus mar sin de. Agus an t-athmhúscailt chultúrtha Ghaeilge atá ann.</P>
    <P>Ach tá rud amháin cinnte. Luaigh an Teachta Sargent Eamon de Valera agus daoine mar é. Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na daoine a bhí mar bhunchloch na hathbheochana, sna fichidí agus sna tríochaidí &ndash; Eamon de Valera, Risteárd Ó Maolchatha, Earnán de Blaghd agus daoine mar sin. Leag siad síos beartas athbheochana anseo go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar mheán cumarsáide ar fud na tíre. Táimid imithe i bhfad ó mbunsmaoineamh sin anois go dtí an áit a bhfuilimid ag caint faoin dátheangachas agus ní aontaíonn gach duine go bhfuil sé sin indéanta ach an oiread. Tá cúlú mór tar éis tarlú i saol na Gaeilge ó tugadh isteach an beartas sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Roinn Oideachais ina gceannródaithe i ndul chun cinn na Gaeilge. Ach tá cúlú mór sa Roinn sin le fiche bliain anuas. Níl siad ina gceannródaithe agus níl siad ag tabhairt treoir do na <Col N="377" /> múinteoirí ó thaobh na Gaeilge de mar ba ghnáthach dóibh san am a chuaigh thart. Tá easpa téacsleabhar ann. Is minic a chuirtear treoracha amach ón Roinn go dtí scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht agus na treoracha sin i mBéarla. Níl sé sin ionghlactha.</P>
    <P>Is féidir a bheith ag caint ar bheartais agus mar sin de agus tá sé in am gníomhaíocht raidiciúil a thabhairt isteach. Éiríonn le pleananna eacnamaíochta, caithfimid plean den chineál céanna a thabhairt isteach agus é a chur i bhfeidhm agus an dul chun cinn ó bhliain go bliain a mheas muna bhfuilimid chun an teanga a chailliúint sa Ghaeltacht. Má chailltear sa Ghaeltacht é níl guarantee ann nó ní féidir geallúint ar bith a thabhairt go mairfidh sé sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh deis againn díospóireachtaí mar seo a bheith againn go rialta anseo &ndash; achan mí, b'fhéidir, sa dóigh gur féidir linn tuairimí a chur i láthair.</P>

        <b>: </b>Fáiltím roimh an seans an dispóireacht seo a bheith anseo inniu. Bheadh sé níos fearr dá mbeadh ráiteas dearfach ón Rialtas os ár gcomhair i láthair na huaire, ag leagadh síos go cruinn fé mar a chíonn an Rialtas an scéal i láthair na huaire. Cé go bhfuil Bille na Gaoluinne ag teacht agus nach fios dúinn go cruinn cathain tá súil againn nach bhfuil sé ró-fhada uainn. D'fhéadfadh ráiteas ón Rialtas, dá mbeadh sé againn, a rá cad iad na rudaí a bheas sa Bhille Teanga i dtreo is gur féidir linn díospóireacht a bheith againn roimh ré. Bheadh an reachtaíocht atá ag teacht níos fearr dá bharr.</P>
      <P>Caithfear taighde agus staidéar i bhfad níos doimhne a dhéanamh ar cheist na Gaoluinne, le go mbeadh a fhios againn cén todhchaí atá i ndán don Ghaoluinn mar theanga labhartha. Tá cúlú mór ag tarlú, tá dlithe eacnamaíochta an domhain ag cur brú ar an nGaoluinn freisin. B'iad cúrsaí eacnamaíochta a chuir tús le géarchéim na Gaoluinne ón naoú aois déag i leith.</P>
      <P>Luadh polaiteoirí móra na haoise seo. Ach is faoi réim na bpolaiteoirí úd a chuaigh na Gaeltachtaí i leig go mór mar go raibh meath ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta. Nuair a thagann meath ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, bíonn ar dhaoine dul ar imirce agus téann an Ghaeltacht i laige chomh maith.

Thosaigh an conradh ag obair ar an suirbhé seo i Mí Feabhra na bliana seo agus chruinnigh siad eolas ó dhoras go doras. I measc na dtorthaí a fuarthas bhí uimhir na ndaoine a fhéachann ar TG4, a éisteann le Raidio na Gaeltachta agus a léann nuachtáin, irisí agus altanna Gaeilge. Chomh maith le san fuarthas amach an méid daoine a thugann tacaíocht don nGaeilge agus don ngaelscoil ar an mbaile agus gur mhaith leo naíonra a bhunú ann. Rinneadh taighde chomh maith ar fhorbairt na Gaeilge imeasc lucht gnó ar an mbaile, ar fhógraí sna siopaí agus ar logainmneacha nua-chumtha ar an mbaile. Is maith an rud gur deineadh suirbhé den sort seo agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar a thuilleadh ins na blianta atá romhainn amach.</P>

      <P>Glacaim buíochas le cathaoirleach an choiste as ucht a thionscnadh go mbéadh an díospóireacht seo againn trathnóna. Beidh spéis agam níos moille trathnóna, fáil amach an ndéanfaidh RTE an rud a déantar go hiondúil nuair a chuirtear ceisteanna pairliminte tré Ghaeilge nó nuair a reachtáltar díospóireacht tré Ghaeilge, sé sin, neamhaird a dhéanamh orthu. Ceann de na rudaí a stopann daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge sa Teach ná go bhfuil a fhios againn a labhraíonn Gaeilge nach mbeidh aon tuairisc ar an méid a deirimid. Ar nós gach uile dhuine eile, caithfimid maireachtáil agus caithfimid ár scéal féin a chur os comhair an phobail. Caithfimid réiteach a fháil ar an bhfadhb seo. Bhéadh níos mó Teachtaí sásta Gaeilge a labhairt sa Dáil dá mba rud é go raibh an seans chéana acu bheith feicthe ar an teilifís agus atá ag duine a labhraíonn Béarla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí an díospóireacht seo usáideach. Is trua liom nach bhfuil breis ama againn na ceisteanna pléadh agus a hardaíodh anseo a chíoradh. Bheadh súil agam go gcuirfí breis ama ar leataobh le haghaidh díospóireacht iomlán chuimsithach ar chursaí Gaeilge a bheith sa Teach anseo. Is deas liom gur sa Teach anseo atá an díospóireacht á reachtáil seachas i gcúl sheomra an choiste. Tá sé <Col N="379" /> tábhachtach go mbéadh díospóireacht ar cheisteanna áirithe. Cá bhfuilimid ag dul? An bhfuil sé mar aidhm náisiúnta an Ghaeilge a láidriú agus a athbheochain? Cá bhfuil ár dtriail?</P>
    <P>An coincheap atá agam féin, go mbeadh Béarla ag gach uile dhuine sa tír. I go leor tír eile tá Béarla ag cuid mhaith de na saoránaigh ach ní shin le rá nach bhfuil a dteangaí féin acu freisin. Ba mhaith liom méadú a fheiceáil go leanúnach, ó dhaonáireamh go daonáireamh, ar líon na ndaoine fásta a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge go laethúil. Dá bhfeicfí sin an méid sin ag dul go 120,000, 150,000 agus ar aghaidh go 200,000 agus méid na ndaoine go bhfuil tuiscint acu don Ghaeilge agus a bhíonn ag breathnú ar chláracha Gaeilge ag méadú an t-am ar fad, bheinn sásta go bhfuil an taoide casta.</P>
    <P>Tá an-mhíthuiscint ann go raibh an t-uafás daoine le Gaeilge ag tús na haoise seo caite agus go rabhdar á labhairt. Ní shin mar a bhí. Taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht is beag Gaeilge ar bith a bhí ann mar ní raibh sí á múineadh sna scoileanna. Athrú mór atá ann go bhfuil daoine ar nós mé féin agus Teachtaí eile atá sa Teach anseo trathnóna nár tógadh sa nGaeltacht ach go bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Níorbh amhlaidh céad bliain ó shoin. An dream sa Ghaeltacht a raibh Gaeilge acu ag an am san, bhí siad fós á caitheamh uathu chomh scioptha in Éirinn agus a bhíodar in ann. Níor tháinig an oiread laghdú ar an nGaeilge le céad bliain agus a cheaptar. Ar bhealaigh áirithe tháinig méadú mór ar úsáid na Gaeilge agus ar fheiceálacht na Gaeilge le céad bliain anuas. Ná bíodh muid ag déanamh amach go raibh an scéal mar a bhí níos fearr agus an scéal mar atá níos measa.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na fáthanna nár chuir mé chuige tuarascáil mhór a réiteach nuair a tháinig mé isteach mar Aire seachas dul agus rudaí áirithe a dhéanamh, ná gur chreid mé go n-úsáidfí sin mar leithscéal gan rud ar bith a dhéanamh go mbéadh an tuarascáil sin le fáil agus b'fhéidir go dtógfadh sé bliain nó bliain go leith chun sin a dhéanamh. Mar sin, chuir mé chun gnímh i dtosach agus ansin d'iarr mé ar Choimisiún na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, tuarascáil a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Ansin bunaiodh an Foras Teanga. Maidir le cursaí polasaí agus comhairle a chur ar an Aire, is faoin bhforas atá sé. Tuigimid na fadhbanna polaitíochta atá ansin. Le cúnamh Dé, nuair a réiteofar na fadhbanna sin tabharfaidh an foras faoin dara cuid de réiteach an phlean, i gcomhairle leis na hAirí thuaidh agus theas agus beidh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ag déanamh an chuid eile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>Courtenay boys school has about 200 children with a speech and language therapy class of seven children and the special school has 30 children. The special school caters for children from west Limerick from a distance of up to 20 miles. These children range in age from five to 13 and have a wide range of disabilities, including autism and Down's syndrome. The special school had a speech and language therapist for one day a week until last Easter. The speech and language therapist was promoted to the speech and language therapy post for the speech and language class and now the special school is deprived of its speech and language therapist.</P>
      <P>The school principal has applied for an increase in the service given that she felt one day a week did not address the individual and group needs of the children, some of whom need an intensive approach. There is now no session for these children who urgently need speech and language therapy. The parents and teachers of the school are anxious that the speech and language therapy service be resumed immediately.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has been unsuccessful in recruiting a therapist. The board has advertised but so far has been unsuccessful. A small number of therapists graduate each year from Trinity College. Some go on to further study in clinical training before joining the workforce. Surely the chronic shortage of speech and language therapists is recognised. It should be possible to advertise vacant positions in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada as an interim measure, and increase the number of places for speech and language therapists until such time as we increase the number of speech and language therapy students at Trinity College.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give a positive response and not excuses in his reply. In this time of economic buoyancy it is immoral to deprive the children who urgently need a speech and language therapy service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of speech and language therapy services in the Limerick area is the responsibility of the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance. With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, the Mid-Western Health Board was providing two sessions per week to support the special classes in the school in question up to last May. At that time the speech and language therapy post became vacant and the board has to date been <Col N="381" /> unsuccessful in filling it, despite two separate advertising campaigns.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that all health boards are facing considerable difficulties in recruiting and retaining the necessary multidisciplinary staff, including speech and language therapists, required to provide health related support services to school going children with special needs. The Department of Health and Children has requested health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to adopt a flexible approach to the delivery of these services and to examine all possibilities in this area to ensure that as many children as possible have access to the necessary support services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has asked me to assure the Deputy that the Mid-Western Health Board will continue to explore all possible means to increase the overall provision of services and in particular to the school in question. He has asked the board to keep him informed of any progress in this matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the broader issue of the recruitment and retention of staff, the Minister wishes to assure the Deputy that his Department is pursuing a number of initiatives to address the difficulties faced by the health services. Earlier this year he received the final report of the expert group on health professionals. Part of this group's remit was to deal with recruitment and retention issues. It is hoped that its recommendations in these areas will help alleviate some of the current difficulties.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that action be taken in relation to manpower planning. A manpower planning study for the therapy professions has been undertaken and is being progressed as a matter of urgency. Following discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, significant progress has been made recently in relation to increasing the number of training places for allied health professionals. An additional 52 places for physiotherapy, three for speech and language therapy, five for occupational therapy and 20 for psychology came on stream last month.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprising representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. A similar exercise can also be undertaken for speech and language and occupational therapy. At least a further 19 psychology places will be available from October 2001 and a service review of psychology services is currently under way in the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has also been liaising with other Government Departments, the health boards and the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to Persons with Mental Handicap to ensure that every opportunity is taken to highlight the career opportunities available in this sector and to maximise the results achieved by the various recruit<Col N="382" /> ment processes which are undertaken by the services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter. I wish it was not necessary to do so, but what has happened in Lucan is a disgrace. There was a similar occurrence in 1993 when the village of Lucan was under three to five feet of water. Business premises and homes were flooded and it caused serious devastation at the time.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, the young residents of the Old Forge and Grange Manor estates, some of whom were only months in their new homes, found their houses under one foot or more of water. There were consequent horror stories about the damage caused to homes and business premises by flooding. Other parts were also most unfortunate, particularly Clonmel, but I wish to outline the annoyance of people in Lucan about why proper action was not taken to prevent the flooding and why, in the intervening years, the council has continued to approve a substantial number of new housing schemes, which are badly needed, with the consequent damage caused.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue in 1993 and I did all the usual things a public representative is expected to do. I contacted the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Department and the county council. Under its water and sewerage investment programme for 2000 to 2002, the Department allocated £12.5 million to South Dublin County Council. The Minister wrote to me on 2 June 2000 and said that I would be pleased to learn that he had approved contract documents for the River Griffeen catchment management scheme. He continued that this scheme was one element of the development of services for Lucan which was approved under the second tranche of the serviced land initiative at an estimated cost of £12.6 million. He said this scheme would help to control the surface water flows in the catchment and reduce the flood risk, particularly to Lucan village. He concluded that it now remained for South Dublin County Council to proceed to invite tenders for the construction of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the reason work did not commence was that the fisheries board had to be consulted and it did not want the work to be done at a particular time of the year. I do not understand why creating flood plains would in any way interfere with the river. Such work would interfere with diverting the river during high rainfall, but I do not understand why flood plains could not have been provided or have been in the process of being created. I call on the Minister to send a competent officer of his Department to South Dublin County Council to find out when and how this work will be carried out. The licensed premises of O'Neill's, Courtney's and Kenny's were badly flooded. The demolition of Kenny's prem<Col N="383" /> ises is under consideration. It is a multimillion pound disaster for these publicans.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that approvals are forthcoming in such circumstances. As I discussed with the Minister some time ago, the problem is the follow through in terms of action. Are there project managers in the Department who ensure that available funds are spent in an efficient, cost effective and speedy manner? Flood plains, high rainfall and the storage of water in parks is not rocket science. I do not understand the position regarding the twelfth lock, under which the canal and the River Griffeen pass. The council has a major nursery for the parks department there and I do not understand this substantial area could not be used to store 0.5 million gallons of water.</P>
    <P>The river continues through Griffeen park and other parkland. I do not understand why a dipped area to divert the river and prevent water congregating in the village of Lucan, sometimes to a depth of four or five feet, cannot be provided. This causes havoc and it will get worse if nothing is done because many more hard surfaces are being created by the continual development of new housing schemes as Lucan is one of Mr. Bacon's solutions to the housing crisis. I ask the Minister to send somebody out to get the work under way to ensure the flooding problems in Lucan do not recur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is good at that himself.</P>
      <P>The Department's primary concern is to ensure that, when adverse conditions arise, local authorities are geared to respond promptly and effectively to help offset the worst effects in relation to those aspects for which they have direct responsibility. The Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for devising and implementing flood relief measures.</P>
      <P>The local authorities' main role is to activate and lead the emergency response to such situations. All local authorities have major emergency plans which are usually activated when events beyond the normal capabilities of the Garda, local authorities and health services, with little or no warning, cause or threaten death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority of the local authority concerning flooding is to ensure public safety and all initial efforts are, therefore, directed to saving life and preventing injuries. Where possible, the local authorities would also be involved in the protection of property. During the recent floods, local <Col N="384" /> authorities, in co-operation with the gardaí, Civil Defence, Army etc., were involved in evacuating people, sandbagging and closing roads where there was a serious threat to public safety.</P>
    <P>South Dublin County Council received its first emergency call arising from the recent flooding at 12.30 p.m. on Sunday, 5 November and the council's drainage work crews were mobilised at 2 p.m. They were later joined by crews from the roads, cleansing and housing departments. They remained on duty throughout most of the period up to the early morning of Tuesday, 7 November. Among the operations carried out were cleaning of river and culvert screens to ease flows, filling and distributing sandbags and freeing blockages throughout the system caused by debris.</P>
    <P>In Lucan, flooding occurred in two locations as a result of the River Griffeen breaking its banks early on Monday morning. The areas affected were the village itself and the new housing estates of Old Forge and Grange Manor. The flooding persisted throughout Monday before the river returned to its channel late on Monday evening. A number of business and residential properties were flooded but, fortunately, no large-scale evacuations were necessary. However, in the limited number of cases it was required, South Dublin County Council staff helped to evacuate residents from their homes.</P>
    <P>The River Griffeen catchment management scheme is being progressed under my Department's water services investment programme in the context of major development of water services infrastructure in the Lucan area. The scheme includes a range of works, such as storm water retention ponds, surface water sewers and earthen berms to attenuate flows in the river. The Minister approved the contract documents for the scheme last June. While the council is anxious to press ahead with the work urgently, I understand that fisheries concerns and the likelihood of difficulties with earthworks in winter conditions, will mean that they will not be in a position to proceed until spring. However, the work will be finished before the end of the summer and when completed will reduce the potential for flooding and provide an increased level of protection in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputies will be aware that the Government has announced a humanitarian relief scheme to deal with losses caused by the recent flooding not covered by insurance. It is understood that the arrangements to finalise this scheme, which will be managed by the Irish Red Cross Society, are being made by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leas-Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this important matter. I am also thankful to the Minister of State for coming in to reply in what I hope will be very favourable terms. This is currently the most important issue in my county of Laois. <Col N="385" /> With regard to the fact that Portlaoise is one of the fastest growing towns in the country, there is a development gridlock because the main drainage scheme has not been approved by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The population of Portlaoise at the last census was 9,600. It is estimated that by the year 2020, in 20 years' time, that will have risen from 9,600 to 30,000. This is phenomenal growth. Over the past two years, planning permission has issued in the town for 2,500 housing units. Currently if there are no new planning applications entered, a further 2,500 are pending or in the system. If we have no new applications for planning 5,000 units are meant to be built over the next two years. However, they will not be built because the Southern Fisheries Board has entered objections to all planning applications entered and has stated that they will continue to do so until such time as the main drainage scheme in the town is up and running. That situation is unacceptable because it means that there is development gridlock and nothing is happening. Housing units to the order of 5,000 are in a state of limbo. This is because of fish kills on the local river, the River Triogue, in the town. It is one of the top five in the league of polluted rivers throughout the country. The fisheries board have made a direct link between the polluted river, the absence of the main drainage scheme and 26 housing developments involving more than 2,500 houses, which are in limbo. Every planning application is the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which as the Minister of State and the House knows, is overburdened. They cannot deal with the number of appeals. They recently sent out notices to every appellant in County Laois extending their length of time for dealing with the applications by a further six months.</P>
      <P>In cases where An Bord Pleanála have granted permission for housing units in Portlaoise, there is a sting in the tail, which is that no house is to be occupied until work on the proposed sewerage plant is completed. In cases where they have allowed the houses to be built, An Bord Pleanála has entered the stipulation that no house be occupied until the main drainage scheme is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to fast track the main drainage scheme. Stage one is ongoing and stage two is not to be completed until the end of 2003 or early 2004 which is unacceptable. In the context of money being made available under the national development plan, which I welcome and which I know the Minister is directing under the many environment schemes, I ask that these be fast-tracked for rapidly growing towns like Portlaoise. As well as the curb on development, there is an immediate practical flooding problem in the west side of the town in the Knockmay and Harper's Lane area which is subject to flooding on a regular basis. Again the solution to this flooding problem will be an advancement on the main drainage scheme. Laois County Council is facing numerous court actions. They have already facilitated the payment of compensation to house<Col N="386" /> holders affected by the flooding and consequent damage. I ask that the Minister and his departmental officials treat this matter as one of extreme urgency. There is severe pressure on the town, the existing sewerage works do not have sufficient capacity to deal with the sewage and stormwater on the west side of the town and on the north and east side of the town, planning, development and building is coming to a standstill. I am aware that the Minister's officials have some paperwork to do on this but a target date of 2003 or 2004 is insufficient. The matter must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and again apologise for the Minister's absence.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, there has been remarkable social and economic growth over the past few years, which has been reflected in a corresponding expansion and broadening of the water and sewerage services investment programme.</P>
      <P>Overall, between 1994 and the end of 1999, we invested over £960 million of capital funding in providing water and sewerage facilities to meet burgeoning social and economic demand. This was very considerably more than that envisaged at the start of the last national development plan. The final year of that plan, 1999, saw record investment of £283 million in water services, an increase of 50% on 1998 expenditure and more than double the 1996 figure.</P>
      <P>Total planned investment in water and sewerage services over the period of the new national development plan is almost £3 billion, with over £2.4 billion for major public schemes. The new investment programme will continue the focus of previous programmes on water and waste water services investment required to support economic and social development, employment generation, maintenance of high growth rates and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
      <P>Last July the Minister announced the water services investment programme 2000-2002, the first phase of a three year programme that will continue up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Funding is being provided for new projects in every single county. The Portlaoise main drainage scheme has been included in this first phase as a scheme to commence in 2001, at an estimated cost of £12 million. This is in addition to the other schemes approved for County Laois, including Portlaoise and Portarlington water schemes, and a combined scheme to serve a number of important smaller rural population centres. Ballyroan and Mountmellick water and sewerage schemes have also been cleared under the rural towns and villages initiative. The total current investment envisaged for Laois under the 2000-02 programme amounts to over £23 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preliminary report for the Portlaoise sewerage scheme has been submitted by Laois County Council and is currently under consideration in the Department. However, the new treatment works will require the prior certification of an <Col N="387" /> environmental impact assessment, which Laois County Council is preparing. The preliminary report cannot be approved until the environmental impact statement has been certified. We are as anxious as the Deputy to ensure that the infrastructure needed to allow Portlaoise to reach its development potential is put in place as quickly as possible. When the planning aspects of the scheme have been completed, the construction works will be started as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, to address immediate needs, including overloading of the treatment plant and flooding problems in some areas of the town, the Minister has recently given approval to Laois County Council to undertake a number of specific interim works which comprise part of Phase 1 of the main scheme.</P>
    <P>In light of the above &ndash; the inclusion of the scheme in the current water and sewerage services programme and the approval of interim works &ndash; the Deputy will appreciate that we are making every effort to assist Laois County Council in meeting development pressures.</P>

The standard of care was inadequate and safeguards scandalously defective. The State still adopts a <i>laissez faire </i>attitude to the well-being of children. It only intervenes when matters are seen to go wrong.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the national children's strategy, Our Children &ndash; Their Lives, published recently, the issue of child poverty is dealt with in just two of the 129 pages. I fail to understand the statistics which show there are just 560 homeless children in the country. In the Fine Gael initiative on children's rights, R is for Rights, figures show that in Dublin alone there were 1,250 children homeless. There are 90,000 living in consistent poverty and more than 40,000 annual cases of physical or sexual abuse against children. It is time the issue of child poverty was seriously dealt with and it is extremely disappointing more attention was not paid to it in the recent strategy announced for dealing with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child poverty in Ireland is significantly higher than poverty among adults. One in six children fell into the national anti-poverty strategy definition of child poverty in 1997 compared to 9.4% of adults. The findings mean that children are almost twice as likely as adults to be poor. Large families and those without a parent at work are highly likely to depend on incomes well below the <Col N="388" /> average after adjustments for different family size. Three quarters of the children in unemployed families, two thirds of those where the household head was sick or disabled and over half of those in families headed by a full time homemaker are in homes living on half of the average income. Some 45% of families with four children and 44% of one parent families are on similar low incomes. Some 43,000 children, or one in every 25, are in families on a waiting list for local authority housing. Families who live in overcrowded conditions, sharing with other households in unfit housing or insecure private tenancies, are among those. A significant minority of these families are registered homeless or living in hostels or bed and breakfast accommodation. Housing poverty is also a reality for most Traveller children. The Government made a commitment to provide 3,100 accommodation places for Travellers by the year 2000, but only 127 units have been built.</P>
    <P>Ireland has one of the worst rates of child poverty in the EU and OECD. I refer the Minister to the budget submission on child poverty entitled Open your Eyes to Child Poverty Initiative where this information is submitted. Poverty is the outcome of an unequal society. Today's poor children are the poor parents and families of the future and an intergenerational cycle of poverty is perpetuated unless anti-poverty interventions are targeted to break that cycle. I call on the Minister to outline in detail what initiatives will be taken to ensure that this cycle of poverty is broken in the generation of the Celtic tiger. For children in poverty it is the age of the Celtic snail.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is still a big factor with regard to child poverty. In spite of falling unemployment and an economy now experiencing a labour shortage, there nevertheless remains some persistent unemployment. Many of those now left behind in the booming economy face multiple problems in accessing jobs, poor skills or literacy levels, low self-confidence and poor job skills. For some people, problems with drugs or alcoholic dependence, psychological difficulties and physical or mental illness pose additional obstacles to securing or retaining steady work. The local employment service has a mandate to offer an individually tailored service for those at high risk of unemployment. However, official figures suggest that, at best, only 10% of this group is currently being reached.</P>
    <P>Living in a lone parent family is another poverty risk for children. The recent report from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on lone parents shows that seven out of ten lone parents and their children are in poverty. This poverty risk is exacerbated by problems of poor education and lack of affordable child care which makes it difficult to secure economic independence and an adequate standard of living. It is disappointing that the national children's strategy did not include a specific analysis and proposals on dealing with lone parenthood and the level of poverty associated with children in such families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> I call on the Government to eliminate extremes of poverty. Any target to eliminate child poverty must also include the elimination of all extremes of deprivation. There should be no children sleeping rough. No child should be living regularly in a hostel, bed and breakfast accommodation or on the roadside. No child should be suffering from malnutrition or going to bed hungry without a main meal. No child should be begging on the streets. No child should drop out of school before transfer to post-primary level or before the leaving certificate because of financial pressure. No child should be addicted to drugs or alcohol, be in prostitution or experience racial or ethnic discrimination.</P>
    <P>Children with disabilities have a right to services that adequately address their health, educational, development and social needs. The aim should be to eliminate all gaps in the service currently available to these children. What plans are there to introduce these immediately at a time when the Government has decided to refer to the Supreme Court a case which confirmed that a child with autism should receive full primary education?</P>

      <P>Child poverty is a matter of particular concern for the Government and it is committed to ensuring that all families have adequate resources and facilities to maximise their ability to fully participate in society. Government policies and programmes aimed at meeting this objective have resulted in significant improvements to date. The most recent information available from the Economic and Social Research Institute working paper on the 1998 living in Ireland survey results show that, in 1994, households with children accounted for more than half of all those below the 50% relative income line. By 1998 this had fallen to 28%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent independent survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute shows that the level of consistent poverty among children has dropped to 12%, a fall of almost 30% in the 12 months period from 1997 to 1998. Behind these statistics on consistent poverty is an improvement in the quality of life for another 50,000 children. This accelerates the downward trend in child poverty figures, with consistent poverty among children being halved from 24.8% in 1987 to 12% in 1998. This massive drop in consistent child poverty is largely attributable to the Government's success through <Col N="390" /> measures such as improvements in the family income supplement, targeted child care supports and a reduction in tax rates, the reduction in unemployment to under 4% and the creation of work friendly policies generally.</P>
    <P>While creating employment is the most effective way of tackling child poverty, we recognise that it is imperative that significant resources continue to be invested in child-related payments. The dedication of substantial resources to child benefit in recent years represents part of the strategy of reforming income support for children in order to reduce work disincentives by making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs looks forward to fully meeting the commitment given in the programme for prosperity and fairness by further increasing child benefit with a target of £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. In addition, recognising the complex issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, a working group is currently being established with an independent chairperson to examine the issues and will report by April 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government's social inclusion strategy entails more than providing additional resources, although resources are of key importance. The emphasis of the Government on a families first approach designed to make families central to the development of policies and services is also relevant. The national children's strategy, which was launched last Monday, 13 November, recognises that poverty is a significant barrier to the potential and participation of children. Highlighting child poverty as a major concern of the Government, the strategy sets out a number of recommendations on which the Government is committed to acting, including an expansion of initiatives to support money management in families through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, increased assistance through active measures for the long-term unemployed and the socially excluded under the national development plan and the targeting of existing measures to assist in the return to education and employment of the long-term unemployed and lone parents. In addition, child poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The Government has already recognised that lone parents face a higher risk of poverty than the population at large. A major review of the impact of supports for one parent families has recently been completed and, on foot of the proposals in the review, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will bring forward a range of measures to overcome the barriers to employment which currently exist.</P>
    <P>The results of the Government's activity over the past three and a half years are conclusive. We <Col N="391" /> have invested millions of pounds in supports and initiatives which aim to help break the cycle of disadvantage. We have invested substantially in public services, health care, education and child care. We have made significant progress to date <Col N="392" /> but we will not rest until child poverty is eliminated. I assure the House we are taking all the necessary steps towards achieving this goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Delivering on Social Inclusion: Lessons from the Local Development Programme, the comparative study on the experiences of the partnership process across seven OECD countries, including Ireland, was recently launched in Dublin. The report put forward a number of recommendations on how weaknesses which have been identified in partnership structures across the seven countries examined might be addressed.</P>
      <P>These issues are a need to strengthen commitment to the work of partnership; a need to develop a more collaborative culture so that programmes can be made more effective and relevant to local needs; and the need to develop a more transparent application of public funds and strong accountability on the part of the partnerships.</P>
      <P>The section of the report which specifically examines the Irish experience provides a very encouraging account of the achievements here over a number of years and clearly acknowledges that the process has played an important role in strengthening local capacity and promoting community development. Notwithstanding this, there is scope for improvement in the delivery of measures to deprived communities and the need for flexibility to take account of the changing economic climate in which these services are being delivered now and in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lessons of the report will now be examined, especially in the context of the recently established city-county development boards &ndash; CDBs &ndash; whose specific functions include facilitating a bottom-up approach to community development. The CDB approach will allow local needs to be identified, to which an integrated <Col N="394" /> response can be developed and local services better targeted and directed at meeting those needs. The process will bring together key interests, including area based partnerships and community groups, and agencies to ensure that public services operating locally will work to a common agenda in a spirit of inter-agency co-operation.</P>
    <P>As regards mainstreaming, already initiatives being delivered in the context of the new National Development Plan, 2000-2006, have a local partnership focus, in particular those relating to education and child care. Indeed, a number of initiatives now being supported under the NDP, particularly in the education and child care areas, were successfully piloted by the local area based partnerships under the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development 1994-1999.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the successful pilot programme under the integrated services process has clearly established that a process of co-operation will facilitate State agencies to deliver a more relevant, focused and effective service to meet local needs. While I do not wish to anticipate the upcoming report of the pilot phase of the integrated services process, including recommendations relating to mainstreaming, I have no doubt that the lessons of the integrated services process will provide us with the very best practice in the delivery of State services in areas of disadvantage.</P>

      <P>In their statement of 18 December 1998, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, following intensive negotiations and consultations involving the Assembly parties and, as appropriate, the <Col N="395" /> Irish and British Governments, announced that tourism would be an area for co-operation under the North-South Ministerial Council provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. In that context, a publicly-owned limited company was to be established by the Northern Irish Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte to carry out a range of functions aimed at promoting increased tourism to the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>On 27 October 2000, I met Ministers Empey and Farren in the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format. At this meeting we agreed the memorandum and articles of association for the proposed tourism company and the necessary start-up arrangements. We also agreed that the board of the new company will have 12 members, including representation from Bord Fáilte, the Northern Irish Tourist Board and tourism industry interests in the North and South. The membership of the board will be formally approved at an early meeting of the NSMC.</P>
      <P>At the inaugural plenary meeting of the NSMC on 13 December 1999, the council agreed that the headquarters of the tourism company would be in Dublin with a regional office in Coleraine. On 27 October, we agreed that that office would have responsibility for printing, publishing and distribution. We have agreed the arrangements for funding the new company, including a South-North funding ratio of 2:1 for the programme costs of the company.</P>
      <P>We have approved a schedule for the establishment of the company that will see it up and running as soon as possible. A project team of senior officials drawn from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Irish Tourist Board has been established to take forward the initial set up arrangements for the company with a view to a progress report being submitted to the next meeting of the NSMC in tourism sectoral format. Finally, we agreed arrangements for recruiting the chief executive officer of the new company.</P>
      <P>We concluded that the work of the NSMC in tourism sectoral format had got off to a satisfactory start and both sides looked forward to working closely together in overseeing the development of the new company. We agreed that the next meeting of the NSMC in tourism sectoral format will take place in January or February 2001.</P>

      <P>I secured in excess of £350 million for tourism programmes under the NDP which will be spread across a number of operational programmes &ndash; OPs &ndash; as follows: tourism marketing, £150 million; in the productive sector OP; tourism training, just over £100 million; in the employment and human resources development OP; and tourism product, £100 million; in the two regional operational programmes for the BMW and the S&amp;E regions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the detailed contents of the OPs, called programme complements, have been finalised and that those in respect of the regional OPs have been discussed at regional assemblies and approved by the monitoring committees.</P>
      <P>The tourism product measure will have five sub-measures: first, development of major attractors; second, special interest pursuits; third, tourism-environment management; fourth, tourism and recreational angling; and fifth, marine tourism.</P>
      <P>Projects will be selected for funding under sub-measures one to three following publication of the tourism measure operational guidelines, which are being drawn up by Bord Fáilte in consultation with my Department. The framework for sub-measures four and five is set by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, which has secured a budget of £44 million for those measures.</P>
      <P>The Bord Fáilte guidelines will incorporate a public call for proposals. They will specify the application process, assessment procedures and decision-making arrangements. It is hoped that the tourism measure operational guidelines will be ready before the end of the year for approval by the monitoring committees for the regional OPs, so as to enable roll-out of the measure to begin in 2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, for the first time ever, tourism product development measures have had to be formally notified to the EU Commission for state aids clearance. Negotiations with the Commission have started in this regard and the process will take some time to complete.</P>
      <P>Pending the launch of the guidelines, I advise any individual or company seeking to promote a tourism project to consult their local regional tourism authority, which is best placed to provide advice and guidance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 16, 19, 21, 27, 38, 41, 46, 52 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>I accompanied the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance at a briefing for the major national governing bodies of sport prior to the launch of the Campus Ireland project on 26 January last. All these organisations indicated their support for the project and I understand that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; is now having discussions with individual sporting organisations as to their requirements and the facilities that they would like provided on the site.</P>
      <P>The positive response from the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI to the stadium proposal is outlined in the feasibility study which is available in the Oireachtas Library. As I already explained in response to another parliamentary question, the feasibility study outlined that a minimum base case of six events per year was required to make the stadium viable and CSID is having discussions with the national sporting organisations about the number of events that will take place in the stadium.</P>
      <P>As I stated in answer to an earlier question, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; estimate the cost of the development of the Campus Ireland project, including Stadium Ireland, at £281 million, and the other elements of the project to be £550 million. As I explained, the development is being undertaken on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. CSID estimates that of the total cost of £550 million, the return related and fully funded private sector elements are in the region of £150 million. Taking account of the private donation of £50 million, the remaining public sector cost is estimated at £350 million. Regarding Deputy Rabbitte's question as to whether the stadium represents good value, this costing was prepared by the consultants who carried out the feasibility report and I do not propose to attempt to second guess the costing. As for Arsenal FC's plans, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have no function in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave a comprehensive update on the progress of the stadium project to the House in my replies to questions on 10 October last. If Deputies wish, I am happy to outline those details again. The day to day progress of the project, including matters such as planning permission and construction schedules, is a matter for the development company, CSID, which the Government established to oversee the design and construction of the project. The company is proceeding as quickly as possible with the aquatic and leisure centre to have it ready in time for the Special Olympics in 2003. CSID hopes to have the heads of agreement negotiated with a consortium before the end of <Col N="399" /> the year. CSID has also advertised an architectural and environmental framework plan competition which will suggest a logical and coherent approach to the development of the site at Abbotstown. That competition is currently under way and the result is expected early next year. The competition is being supervised by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland. CSID expects to tender for the remaining facilities shortly on the same basis as for the aquatic and leisure centre, that is, on a design, build, operate and maintain basis.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £10 million was included in the Department of the Taoiseach's Estimate for this year. That allocation was made to facilitate the start up of the project. I am informed that expenditure from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach to date in 2000 has been £141,982.47. I understand that further payments are pending which are being processed at present, mainly in respect of office accommodation costs and studies into individual elements of the development such as the aquatic and leisure centre. The Department of the Taoiseach spent £380,033 in 1999 on the initial feasibility study entitled A Stadium for the New Century.</P>

The objective of the review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy, develop revised strategies <Col N="400" /> and, if necessary, new structures through which to deliver them. The overall aim is to ensure that the policies and strategies which are being pursued at present remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground.</P>
      <P>There was a high level of public interest in the review and I decided to carry out a thorough and lengthy nationwide consultation process over the summer months.</P>
      <P>Initially interested individuals and organisations were invited to make a submission and 189 of these were received. Eight regional consultative fora were also held around the country at which over 600 people took part. I subsequently invited over 30 agencies and organisations to make detailed presentations to further assist in the identification of any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy.</P>
      <P>I hope to have the review completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>Growth in tourism over the past ten years has been unprecedented, with visitor numbers doubling to six million and foreign exchange earnings tripling to £2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>I do recognise that, while all regions have shared in this growth, there has been some significant variations in performance. I can assure the Deputy that it has been one of my top priorities to facilitate a more balanced regional spread of tourism revenue. This is clearly reflected in the strategy outlined in the national development plan which provides over £350 million for tourism marketing, training and product development. In the drafting of the tourism product development measures, in particular, there will be a clear focus on widening the spatial spread of tourism and on diverting pressure from highly developed areas. This will be addressed by utilising the potential of the less developed areas through support for the strengthening of special interest facilities, the upgrading and better presentation of a number of clusters of existing attractions and facilities and, in specific circumstances, the development of some new major attractions.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte's regional marketing programme will complement this strategy &ndash; not only through destination promotion but also by measures to attract visitors to particular regions, such as encouragement and support for special niche products that are especially important to the less developed tourism areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it cannot be emphasised often enough that successful realisation of the tourism <Col N="401" /> product development strategy which will be embedded in the regional OPs is dependent on, and directly linked to, the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it is the prerogative of the visitor to determine where he or she spends a holiday. Many factors influence such decisions and the variation in performance in Ireland is due, in no small way, to international industry trends, such as the growth in short breaks and urban tourism. However, I am satisfied that current tourism strategies will continue to contribute to a more balanced spread of tourism in Ireland.</P>

      <P>While the Government and I acknowledge the right of the FAI to proceed with the development of Eircom Park, the House will be well aware that we have also clearly expressed, repeatedly, the wish that the FAI would come on board with the Stadium Ireland project. It makes economic and financial sense for the FAI to do so.</P>
      <P>We have already indicated to the FAI, that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; estimates that revenue in the region of up to £40 million could be generated for the FAI through ticket sales alone. In addition, of course, the FAI would not be faced with any capital debt repayments or infrastructural and administrative costs.</P>
      <P>In my view the FAI could do excellent work by distributing this £40 million to club and youth soccer facilities and training right across the country. The FAI would, in that situation, have full use of the National Stadium without any cost to them until matches come to be played and they would, consequently, be able to assist the overall development of soccer in this country on an unprecedented scale.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to meet the FAI to discuss the proposed development at this time, nevertheless, I am available to meet them if they so wish.</P>

      <P>Under the 2000 sports capital programme grants to the value of £36 million were allocated to some 675 projects. To date, almost £200,000 of this amount has been drawn down.</P>
      <P>Following the finalisation of the allocations, grantees were informed of the allocations in July and August of this year. As the allocation of the grant brings with it conditions which must be met by the grantee before the grant can be confirmed and paid, it would not be unusual that many of the grantees would not yet have responded formally to the Department or not have yet drawn down the grant.</P>
      <P>Recipients of grants have been given until the end of September 2001 to submit the relevant documentation to facilitate the drawing down of funds and the grant offer can be withdrawn at any time after that date if the required conditions are not fulfilled. Any grants withdrawn under this process reduce the overall commitments of the Department under the programme. I am planning to announce the 2001 sports capital programme in December.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's sports capital programme substantial funding is provided towards the provision of sport and recreation facilities for clubs and organisations. Soccer clubs at local and junior levels continue to benefit under the programme and this year alone, grants totalling £4.254 million were allocated to 101 soccer clubs at grassroots level in every part of the country. In addition, grants to the value of £1.2 million were allocated to six national league clubs this year, all of which are deeply involved in the training, coaching and development of young players and teams.</P>
      <P>I intend to announce details of the 2001 sports capital programme next month and local soccer clubs will again have an opportunity to apply for assistance from the programme for the improvement of their grounds and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the FAI presented its previous pre-budget submission, Improving the Quality of Life and Social Inclusion Through the Development of Soccer, in November 1999, the Minister for Finance and myself met them separately and it was made clear at the time that while the pro<Col N="403" /> posals contained in the submission were progressive the question of funding of the association could only be considered in the context of overall sports policy in relation to the whole spectrum of sports and of the resources available.</P>
    <P>The latest proposals from the FAI echo those put forward last year, and I have referred them to the Irish Sports Council for consideration in the context of their overall sports funding priorities and available resources. The Irish Sports Council is currently providing a special grant of £62,000 to the Football Association of Ireland for a special pilot programme for the promotion and development of soccer among youth in identified areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 34, 42 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish tourism and hospitality industry has been an extremely vibrant one over the past ten years catering last year alone for six million overseas visitors in addition to the rapidly expanding demand from the local domestic market, and bringing over £2.5 billion in foreign exchange revenue into our economy. This success has created new challenges for the industry not only in terms of maintaining its competitive position in an ever more competitive international environment, but also in the competition for staff in Ireland's tightening labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism and hospitality industry needs to further deepen its relationship with CERT who is actively encouraging and promoting the development of training capacity and better human <Col N="404" /> resource management skills within the industry. Achieving this objective will be essential if the industry is to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to allocate £107 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to help industry, over that seven year period, to secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. In this context, over £15 million has been allocated to CERT in 2000 to enable it to commence the implementation of its recently launched Strategic Plan 2000-2006 which is designed to deliver the objectives set out in the NPD for raising and maintaining the highest operational and human resource standards in tourism.</P>
    <P>CERT is currently undertaking a pilot programme targeted at long-term unemployment black spots which has proved to be very popular and successful with participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses. The programme is currently under way in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Merchant's Quay with a view to its replication in other parts of the country which have experienced particularly high levels of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in March this year, I launched CERT's new nationwide programme to encourage people who have been out of the workforce for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry. The programme of training is designed to encourage adults who have been out of the labour market for a number of years, whether after rearing a family or for other social reasons, to consider returning to work in the tourism industry. The courses in this programme are flexible and have been specifically designed to cater for their needs. The courses provide 100 hours of multi-skills training over a period of ten weeks, with an emphasis on general catering skills. They are provided on a modular basis, which allows participants to build progressively on their achievements and permit participants to complete the programme locally. Also, training and employment is offered to each potential employee on a &ldquo;flexible hours&rdquo; basis, typically 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each day.</P>
    <P>The programme is being made accessible on a nationwide basis and the training centres are located across all the provinces. It is projected that 5,000 adults will complete this programme by 2005. Five hundred are expected to complete courses at 15 training centres across the country this year alone.</P>
    <P>CERT has indicated that, to date, the lack of child care facilities has not presented itself as a major issue in attracting people to courses such as the return to work programme.</P>
    <P>CERT's annual careers roadshow was launched on 16 October and will visit a total of 16 venues countrywide and hold over 70 sessions in various <Col N="405" /> second-level institutions. It is targeted at secondlevel students from transition year to leaving certificate level and is implemented in partnership with the major industry bodies including the Irish Hotels' Federation, The Restaurants' Association of Ireland, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association. The roadshow is being advertised through local radio stations and newspapers. On 12 October I launched the careers magazine &ldquo;Get a Life in Tourism&rdquo;. This magazine is a CERT joint venture with the industry bodies and highlights the variety of careers on offer in the sector.</P>
    <P>CERT has also recently launched the new RETAIN initiative to help address concerns in the tourism and hospitality industry over recruitment and staff retention. Financial assistance of up to £15,000 over a three year period will be available, under certain conditions, to businesses for improvement in human resources management, which is the key to tackling the industry's staffing problems. These new supports are designed to attract participation in the scheme from firms right across the industry. Smaller companies, whose individual needs may not warrant a dedicated human resource professional, are being encouraged to consider joining several others in an application with a view to sharing a dedicated human resource executive. Alongside the new scheme, CERT will be running a series of courses for owners and general managers on modern human resource best practice.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels, I understand that tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Scotland and Wales which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. Recruitment drives are currently being considered for other European locations. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, which welcomes employers to such recruitment drives. I understand that the Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual bodies are also participating in EURES, the European Employment Service, to help satisfy labour shortages in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>CERT will be organising a major conference on 27 November on world class service in tourism and hospitality for general managers and senior executives in the industry. Featuring a panel of international speakers and the findings of the latest international research carried out this year, the conference will focus on the best practice in human resources and operations management with a view to its adoption here.</P>

      <P>Under the social inclusion and child care sub-programme of the national development plan, for the period 2000-2006, a sum of £370 million has been allocated to the local development measure, the measure for which my Department has responsibility, to combat social exclusion and drug abuse.</P>
      <P>Of this allocation, £12.5 million has been advanced so far this year to Area Development Management Limited to meet expenditure incurred in the local action plans of the partnerships and community groups.

ADM expects that all plans will be approved by 31 December 2000 and that it will draw down approximately £19.4 million for the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs initiative, an amount of £10.4 million has been drawn down to date in 2000. This amount relates to expenditure under the existing local drugs task force plans. The task forces are currently finalising updated plans for assessment by the national drugs strategy team. To date, five plans have been submitted already with the remaining nine expected over the coming months. It may be anticipated that drawdown on the new plans will commence early in 2001.</P>

      <P>As indicated to the House in my response to Question No. 30 on 10 October last, I am aware of reports indicating a slight downturn in the level of business enjoyed by the B &amp; B sector. However, it is also reported that, while casual passing trade has declined, demand through trade channels is growing. According to Bord Fáilte reports, industry sources have indicated that the main factors influencing this downturn include a general shift in the preference of domestic and international markets towards the additional facilities offered by hotels and a preference to be located nearer towns and cities. Increased price competition from hotels is also a factor to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Last year, I launched an initiative, with a budget of £300,000, targeted primarily at the small accommodation provider. Under this initiative, Bord Fáilte was to review the branding and overseas marketing of the various groups in this category with a view to increasing business overall, particularly in the off-peak season and in rural areas.</P>
      <P>This initiative involves supporting a range of practical promotional activities on behalf of the B &amp; B sector, including attendance at trade fairs, advertising and off-season promotion with tour operators in addition to organising a series of educational workshops for individual operators.</P>
      <P>Since April this year, Bord Fáilte has repeated the specialised marketing support programme for the B &amp; B sector, with an increased budget of £500,000.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sports Council statement of strategy, 2000-02, entitled &ldquo;A New Era for Sport&rdquo; was formally launched in September. The strategy statement sets out clearly the council's vision for sport and how it proposes to deliver on that vision. The strategy incorporates a pathway for the creation of local sports partnerships as a means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level, along the lines envisaged by Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>I understand that as part of the consultation process, the council has met with interested parties and is currently meeting with relevant Departments. The council will advertise shortly for declarations of interest from local statutory agencies to be considered as part of the pilot process and expect to have a number of pilot projects in place during 2001.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sports Council is responsible for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport in Ireland and provides annual grants to national governing bodies of sport, including Swim Ireland, the national swimming federation, to assist in its work for the advancement of swimming at all levels throughout the country. Meanwhile, the Government has approved a considerably accelerated programme of investment in refurbishment and provision of new pools under the local authority swimming pool programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to establish the extent of the work required, ILAM (Ireland), a consultancy firm specialising in sport facilities, was commissioned to prepare a report on the condition of local authority pools built between 1966 and 1981. Some 30 pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. I then secured a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-02. As a result, funding available for the programme has <Col N="409" /> increased from £3 million per annum to £15 million per annum in each of these years.</P>
    <P>Following my announcement of the increased funding, local authorities were invited to submit proposals and a total of 51 such proposals were received in my Department by the closing date of 31 July 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives prompt consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
    <P>The Government has also approved proceeding with the development of an aquatic and leisure centre at the Campus and Stadium Ireland site at Abbotstown. Construction work on this facility is expected to commence in mid 2001. Meanwhile, my Department has already committed a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a 50 metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion next year.</P>
    <P>When the above programmes of investment are completed, they will together provide a range of high quality swimming facilities which will contribute considerably to the ongoing work of the Irish Sports Council and the national governing bodies in the development of the sport of swimming both on a competitive and leisure basis.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding for the development of sport and recreational facilities, throughout the country, under a number of programmes: the sports capital programme, the swimming pool programme and the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> The sports capital programme operated by my Department provides funding for sport and recreational facilities at national, regional and local levels and aims to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities for an integrated and planned approach to sports and recreation, with priority for designated disadvantaged areas. I hope to be inviting applications for funding under the 2001 programme before year-end. All applications are assessed having regard to criteria set out in the guidelines accompanying the applications. No funds are specifically earmarked before applications are assessed and allocations are made having regard to the merits of each application. However, this year, in order to further ensure a more even distribution of funding throughout the country, I introduced an arrangement whereby each county was allocated a minimum of £200,000.</P>
    <P>My Department has committed a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a 50 metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion next year. Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.

There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives prompt consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available. During the period 2000-02, an amount of £45 million will be available for the swimming pool programme.</P>
    <P>Under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the NDP, £85 million has been specifically allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities for 2000-06. These facilities will be located at gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Once the gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities, and where appropriate voluntary and community organisations, for the provision or upgrading of sport and recreational facilities. Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion by the middle of 2001, when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>

      <P>The overall thrust of the tourism product measures in the regional operational programmes is to create the instruments to help spread the economic benefits of tourism throughout the country. Under the national development plan, I obtained £100 million to support these measures. Additional moneys will also be available under the aegis of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, for supporting tourism related developments. All these measures are included in the two regional OPs which are expected to be approved shortly by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Over the past two to three years, a general consensus has emerged across consultants, the tourism industry, the tourism development agencies, the EU Commission and my Department on the need to focus future capital investment on the less developed tourism areas. The objective is to develop a number of additional tourism growth poles by utilising the potential of the less developed areas through support for the strengthening of special interest facilities, the upgrading and better presentation of a number of clusters of existing attractions and facilities and, in specific circumstances, for the development of some new major attractions.</P>
      <P>The focusing of support on less developed tourism areas and the fostering of a number of new growth poles in those areas should have a significant positive spin-off for hotels in such areas, and on the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector generally to respond to growth in visitor numbers. Last year I launched a pilot marketing initiative, under which Bord Fáilte had provided a budget of £300,000, targeted primarily at small accommodation providers with a view to increasing business overall, particularly in off-peak seasons and in rural areas. This year Bord Fáilte has continued the initiative with an increased budget of £500,000 and the ambit of the scheme has broadened to include small family run hotels.</P>

      <P>Framework 111 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness makes a commitment to tackle concentrations of deprivation through a targeted investment programme aimed at the 25 most disadvantaged urban and rural communities. My Department, in consultation with the social partners, is identifying the most deprived communities, using agreed objective criteria.</P>
      <P>A process is also being devised, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the social partners, through which targeted investment can be delivered effectively to these areas.

      <P>The implementation of national tourism marketing and promotion policies is best undertaken by a dedicated executive body such as Bord Fáilte, working in concert with the tourism industry. In an important recent development at the inaugural meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format held in Belfast on 27 October, the establishment was announced of a new North/South company with responsibility for all island international tourism marketing under the Good Friday Agreement. When fully implemented, this development will further refine overall arrangements for international tourism marketing through an enhanced all island approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also point to the establishment in April this year of a new Tourism Marketing Partnership involving Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourism industry which is designed to bring about a greater level of synergy between industry and the board in international tourism marketing planning and implementation. This is a good example of co-operation and partnership between the State sector and the private commercial arm of the tourism industry. We have adopted a professional and sensible approach to marketing Ireland abroad and our excellent performance in terms of tourism growth in recent years against targets set pro<Col N="415" /> vides some evidence that the approach adopted has been successful and cost effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, a key objective in delivering and maintaining a high quality programme of development co-operation is the achievement of a balance, utilising all the channels available to promote sustainable development of a targeted country. This objective requires that there be a clear focus, across all sectors, on the need to build capacity at all levels within developing countries. The emphasis must be on the need to support indigenous ownership and processes within poor countries to ensure that development gains for the poor are real and sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NGOs and missionaries are valuable means of delivering help to the poorest of the poor and this is reflected in the fact that in 1999 they received almost £25 million from my Department, representing 13% of total ODA. But important too, especially for sustained and lasting development, are the partnerships between donors and host Governments. These partnerships are the foundations which foster the human and institutional development that are necessary if the developing world is to break out of the cycle of poverty and crisis. The issues of basic needs and associated enabling policies, governance, economic growth <Col N="416" /> and physical infrastructure are dealt with within this partnership framework. Also vital is the role played by multilateral organisations on a whole range of issues from emergency responses to addressing the enormous and unsustainable debt burden faced by so many developing countries.</P>
    <P>Our relationship with NGOs and missionaries is deep and abiding and is based on the outstanding reputation which they have established in helping poor people. We provide a wide range of assistance through numerous channels: emergency humanitarian assistance; emergency preparedness and post emergency rehabilitation assistance; NGO co-financing scheme; block grants scheme; in-country micro projects scheme; democratisation and human rights programme; and funding of personnel through APSO.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, my Department is currently examining the provision of multi-annual programme budgeting for those NGOs who have the capacity to programme in this way. This process will give increased focus to qualitative outcomes, impact and rigorous evaluation in order that we can share lessons learned and continuously adopt a best practice approach.</P>
    <P>The OECD, in its examination in 1999 of the Irish Government's programme of development co-operation, commented that &ldquo;by DAC, the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, standards, direct support to NGO activities and support through NGOs already absorbs a relatively large share of the Irish Government's aid spending...Many observers, including NGOs themselves, are sceptical about large increases in funding, as it is doubtful whether Irish NGOs could expand their programmes more than marginally, at least in the short-term, and maintain quality in their activities&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, I <Col N="417" /> decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5' 4&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict the relevant percentages in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
    <P>The current strength of military personnel appointed or attached to the Army Equitation School is 38 comprising ten officers, nine non-commissioned officers, 16 privates, one of whom is on leave of absence, and three cadets, which figures include seven female personnel in all comprising one officer, five privates, one on leave of absence and one cadet.</P>

This Department subsequently wrote to the pensioner in the matter and it was agreed with him to recover the overpayment by making fortnightly deductions of £5 from his pension. The deductions commenced in this case with effect from 20 July 2000 and will continue until such time as the amount of the overpayment is recouped in full. As my Department has an accounting responsibility to recover such overpayments, I regret to say that the question of a waiver cannot be considered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bovine animals which react positively to either a TB or brucellosis test must, by law, be removed to an approved export premises for slaughter. EU <Col N="420" /> Directive 64/433, which legislates for intra-community trade in fresh meat, requires that all such animals are given a detailed veterinary examination and in this regard my Department maintains a permanent veterinary presence at all export slaughter premises. However, due to the high frequency of testing only some of these animals will have developed clinical disease and a proportion will in fact be false positives to the tuberculin test. Each of the reactors is subject to a full ante and post-mortem inspection, the results of which determine eligibility for entry to the food chain.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland recently reviewed the arrangements in place and is satisfied that there are no public health implications involved. Given that TB and brucellosis is now virtually eradicated in France, the recent legislative changes are thought to be part of a marketing strategy rather than a response to any food safety concerns.</P>

      <P>I regard animal welfare as a high priority in view of both the legitimate concern that animals be transported in acceptable conditions and the pragmatic reason that it is in the interests of livestock farmers and their families that their animals reach their destination in the best possible condition. I therefore regard rigorous enforcement of animal-welfare criteria as vital to our export trade in live animals.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that animals are leaving this country in full compliance with the regulations governing animal health and welfare. There have been reports of a small number of specific instances where people responsible for the transport of animals from Ireland did not appear to have adhered strictly to EU welfare rules. These reports relate to the implementation of the rules in other jurisdictions. In this context officials of my Department are in regular contact with their counterparts in those jurisdictions so that any such instances as arise are dealt with promptly.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to approved livestock hauliers to remind them of their obligation to adhere to rules in relation to the protection of animals during transport and to advise them that I will consider revoking the licences of hauliers found to have been in breach of these rules.</P>

      <P>My Department has no plans to publish a leaflet for carers. However, the Carers Association, which is in receipt of an annual grant of £270,000 from my Department, has published an information pack for carers which details information on the carers allowance, the respite grant available and other benefits which are available from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The pack also gives information on the services provided to carers by health boards. The information pack is available free of charge to carers from the Carers Association, St. Mary's Community Centre, Rathmines, Dublin 6.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has recently published its own information booklet on the entitlements of carers and this booklet is available from any social welfare office or the Department's information service at Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, Dublin 1, Tel: 01 874 8444. The Deputy may also be interested in a publication from the former National Social Service Board &ndash; now part of the new organisation &ldquo;Comhairle&rdquo;&ndash; listing all entitlements for the over 60's which includes information for carers. I have sent a copy of this publication to the Deputy for his information under separate cover.</P>

    <P>My Department has allocated funding of £1 million in 1999 with an additional £1 million in 2000 to the health boards for the provision of additional support to carers. The boards have allocated this funding based on local needs and it has been used in a variety of ways, including provision of training for carers, establishing carer support groups, appointing a co-ordinator of services for carers and providing assistance to volun<Col N="426" /> tary groups.  A sum of £800,000 was provided to the boards in 1999 and 2000 for the provision of additional paramedical and nursing supports in the community. These supports should lead to a more acceptable locally based service for older people and their carers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the best possible implementation of the cardiovascular strategy report, a task force and advisory forum were established. In terms of progressing the strategy, those bodies have regard to the need to progress implementation in a way that recognises existing infrastructural realities in general practice and strategically develop the role that it can play to the greatest degree possible over the timescale of the strategy. Health boards are also directly involved in this process of directing the significant funding available to developing the role of general practice in line with the cardiovascular strategy.</P>
      <P>In that context, general practice is already benefiting to a major extent from funding under the cardiovascular strategy programme which has allowed a number of significant initiatives to take place.</P>
      <P>For example, the cardiovascular report proposes that a systematic approach be taken in primary care to the risk assessment, secondary prevention and ongoing management of those identified as being high risk and pilot projects of secondary prevention in two health board areas are currently under way. Other examples of relevant initiatives include the provision of funds for equipment, sessional and health promotion programmes in general practice settings, recruitment of cardiovascular specialist personnel and the provision of specific training on intervention techniques.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in the structured sense of developing general practice that the cardiovascular strategy envisages, it has to be seen that screening is only one of a large number of proposals in the report for general practice, all of which must be addressed in a strategic way consistent with the strategy's overall goals.</P>
      <P>During 2001, and in the years following, it is proposed to further develop and extend the cardiovascular capacity of general practice in line with the Building Better Hearts programme. In particular a national pilot project for secondary prevention will commence in 2001.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the health boards that the immunisation campaign to protect against group C meningococcal disease is progressing well. General practitioners are providing the vaccine to the under five age group and health board teams are undertaking vaccination of 15-18 year olds in post-primary schools. Vaccination of third-level students is also proceeding. There is no difficulty in relation to vaccine supply. While it is as yet too early to establish the precise level of uptake being achieved, preliminary indications are that uptake is good.</P>
      <P>The meningococcal C immunisation campaign is the single biggest immunisation programme ever undertaken. When completed up to 1.3 million people will have been immunised. A programme of this scale required careful planning and implementation. It is being implemented over a 12 to 18 month period. It was decided those most vulnerable to infection should be immunised first, that is, babies and children up to the age of four and young people aged 15-18 years. In response to inquiries, the Office for Health Gain obtained legal advice on how family doctors should deal with any cases where they were asked to vaccinate children outside the initial priority groups. The health boards were informed by the Office for Health Gain of the advice received. This matter is an operational one for the Office for Health Gain and the health boards in the first instance. I understand from the Office for Health Gain that the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners have responded positively to the initiative taken in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has been in touch with the FDA, the United States regulatory authority, concerning the research findings and issued a number of press statements in relation to the matter as updated information became available, the latest of which issued on 14 November 2000. The matter is being kept under continuous review and any regulatory action deemed necessary will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study in the United States, which took place at Yale University School of Medicine, identified an association between the use of phenylpropanolamine, PPA, and the occurrence of haemorrhagic stroke in women. The use of this ingredient in the United States is quite different to that in Ireland. In the United States, products containing this ingredient are used for weight control, as appetite suppressants, which is not an authorised indication in Ireland. Similarly, the <Col N="432" /> doses used for weight control are much higher than those recommended for the treatment of coughs and colds.</P>
    <P>There are currently 18 phenylpropanolamine containing medicinal products authorised for use as cold remedies in Ireland, some of which have been authorised for more than 20 years. To date, no reports of suspected stroke occurring in Ireland have been notified to the Irish Medicines Board associated with use of these products.</P>
    <P>Following initial review of the data and in the context of use in Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board does not consider that there is a need to withdraw these products from the marketplace at this time. The Irish Medicines Board is aware that some pharmaceutical companies, following corporate negotiations with their parent groups may withdraw their PPA-containing products from the Irish marketplace for business reasons.</P>
    <P>As always, the Irish Medicines Board recommends that patients read carefully the instructions on the packaging and patient information leaflets supplied with these products. In particular, the daily recommended dose should not be exceeded. Patients should consult their doctor or pharmacist with any problems or uncertainties.</P>

      <P>However, the measure has also benefited a significant number of people in receipt of pro-rata pensions at less than 50% of the standard maximum rate. The OACP rate structure was also rationalised in budget 2000 with the number of standard rates being reduced from six to four. It is estimated that about 38,000 pensioners improved their position as a result of this measure.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent payable to persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>The person concerned received a rent supplement up to the end of September. Their rent supplement was suspended from that date as their claim was under investigation. A decision on whether the rent supplement should be restored will be made when this investigation is complete.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of one-parent family payment of £100.70 per week which is the maximum rate payable to a person with one dependent child. This total includes a fuel allowance payment of £8 per week. Their entitlement to one-parent family payment is currently under review. When this review is completed the person concerned will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>The proposed housing development is the subject of a planning application which is with Athlone Urban District Council for determination under the local government planning and development code. My Department is not a party to such decision making process other than to offer advice and make recommendations, where warranted.</P>
      <P>Following an initial assessment of the planning application by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, it was considered that the proposed development would have a negative impact on the Middle Shannon Callows special protection area, SPA. In March 2000, my Department notified the council of its objection to the proposed development and recommended that planning permission be refused.</P>
      <P>I understand that a number of issues were raised subsequently in relation to the inclusion of this development site in the proposed SPA and, accordingly, that a more comprehensive review of the conservation status of the development site was carried out by my Department. The review established that the development site itself did not contain any important habitat and its conservation value is not sufficient to warrant its future designation as a proposed conservation area.</P>
      <P>I am advised that while the technical assessment of Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, now is that the proposed development would not have a significant negative impact on the adjacent SPA, concerns remain about possible adverse effects on corncrakes, who use the nearby area. Such concerns arise from possible disturbance to these fauna as a result of human and domestic pet activity and from light from the proposed dwellings, which would result from a development of this size. Accordingly, Dúchas has recommended some mitigation measures to the council and intimated in September 2000 that, if these measures were taken, objection to the proposed development could be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Sixteen companies tendered for the supply, installation and commissioning of a Garda CCTV system in Cork city centre.</P>
      <P>The tenders were evaluated by the Garda telecommunications section using the following criteria as specified in the request for tender document. These were as follows: price, the overall cost of provision of the system including all mandatory items; availability and cost of desirable options; future development potential of system; supplier background-experience and quality and cost of support offered.</P>
      <P>The costs of carrying out civil works was not a criteria in the evaluation process as the associated costs were contingent on the availability of the ducts and the identification of each cable route by the successful tenderer.</P>
      <P>Following the evaluation process, the successful tender recommended was that submitted by SKS Communications Limited. The cost quoted was IR£483,188, including VAT. My Department subsequently obtained the approval of the Department of Finance for the expenditure of this money on the Cork CCTV project and the approval of the Government contracts committee for the awarding of the contract to SKS Communications Limited. Approval for the provision of an additional amount of IR£100,000 for the civil works associated with this project, i.e., ducting, re-instatement of roads-footpaths and provision of ESB supplies, was also received from the Department of Finance at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that fibre optic cabling was chosen as the transmission media for the Cork city centre CCTV system. The <Col N="438" /> request for tender documents for the CCTV project requested a fibre optic transmission system installed in underground ducting to be provided by Cork Corporation. The completion of the project was contingent on the availability of ducts and the identification of each cable route by the successful tenderer. The option of using a microwave transmission medium was also specified in the request for tender document but most companies submitted tenders for the fibre optic option only.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that SKS Communications Limited discovered during the course of the installation of the CCTV system that major parts of the ducting were not in place and, that, in other cases ducts were blocked. A ducting survey was carried out by SKS Communications Limited and this survey showed that available ducting did not fully correspond with that which was previously understood to be available. Discussions then took place between representatives of the Garda authorities and Cork Corporation in an effort to have the necessary ducting installed.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the corporation is unable to undertake this work and, consequently, arrangements for the carrying out of the work will have to be made by the Garda authorities and my Department. In this regard, the Garda authorities have recently submitted a detailed proposal as to how best this work can be carried out and this proposal is currently receiving attention.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there has been no undue delay on the part of the Garda authorities or my Department in the carrying out of the Cork CCTV project and that I want to see the CCTV system installed and operational at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Irish Sports Council is, at my request, undertaking a review of Ireland's preparation for and participation in the Sydney Olympics, with a view to identifying the lessons to be learnt in preparing for the next Olympics in 2004.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the review is to examine, in depth, how Ireland went about preparing for, selecting and managing our national participation in Sydney, and, as I said, the lessons we can learn for Athens 2004. Accordingly, I called on all 28 national governing bodies of sport affiliated to the Olympic movement, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the National Coaching and Training Centre, and Sydney Olympic coaches and competitors, to contribute to the review on the basis of their expertise and experience of these and previous Olympics. I also met with representatives of the 11 national governing bodies of sport whose athletes competed at the Sydney Games, to impress especially on them the importance of any contribution they can make to the review.</P>
      <P>I very much appreciate, of course, the commitment shown by the Olympic Council of Ireland to involvement and participation in the review. It was in this context, and in the light of the importance that I attach to the review and to the need for a wholehearted contribution from all the main parties involved in the preparation, selection and organisation of our Olympic team, that I met the President and officials of the Olympic Council of Ireland on 8 November last.</P>
      <P>Our meeting provided an opportunity for an open and frank discussion on Sydney 2000 and issues which arose before, during and after the Sydney Games. I know that both the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Irish Sports Council will be following up on a number of the issues discussed, including suggestions for improvements, as part of the review process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review will, I hope, result in positive and constructive outcomes that will benefit future planning for Ireland's participation at the Olympic Games. I hope, too, that a more positive and supportive environment will result from these deliberations &ndash; a climate that will encourage and nurture our Irish participants, ensuring co-operation, and the sharing of goals among all <Col N="440" /> the organisations and agencies involved with future Irish Olympic teams.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the council's report of the review before the end of January next in the belief that whatever comes out of it will become the foundation of a new and exciting era in Ireland's proud Olympic history.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are almost 70 local authority swimming pools in Ireland. Last year my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland), who are consultants specialising in sports facilities, to prepare a report on the condition of local authority pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. I then secured a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-2, effectively increasing the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million over these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives prompt consideration <Col N="441" /> to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
    <P>My Department has also committed a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a full competition size 50-metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion next year.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved proceeding with the development of an aquatic and leisure centre at the Campus and Stadium Ireland site at Abbotstown, incorporating a full competition size 50 metre pool, with a view to completion in time for the Special Olympics which is being held in Dublin in 2003.</P>
    <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme also operated by my Department provides funding to clubs/organisations at local, regional and national level for the provision of sports and recreational facilities. Under the programme funding is allocated on the basis of individual applications received with special priority being given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
    <P>The 2000 programme was advertised in early December 1999 and the closing date for the receipt of applications was 11 February 2000. Some 1,650 applications were received and evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions which accompanied the application forms and I announced the bulk of the grant allocations in July 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the programme applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and the local authority before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to the identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national level are also required to ensure that the proposals are consistent with the priorities of their national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department consults as appropriate, when assessing applications, with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level.</P>
    <P>The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF), which forms part of the Government's national drugs strategy, provides funding to support the development of youth facilities, including sport and leisure facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. To date, the fund has allocated in excess of £37 million over three years to assist over 330 projects with the primary aim of attracting young people <Col N="442" /> in the targeted areas, at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more healthy pursuits. While my Department has responsibility for policy and some operational matters in relation to the fund, the moneys are held in the Vote of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council was established on 1 July 2000. The council's statement of strategy, 2000-02, entitled &ldquo;A New Era for Sport&rdquo;, was formally launched in September. The strategy statement sets out clearly the council's vision for sport and how it proposes to deliver on that vision. The strategy incorporates a pathway for the creation of local sports partnerships as a means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level, along the lines envisaged by Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is expected that a number of pilot projects will be put in place in 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the Irish Sports Council, is making more than £800,000 available over three years towards this initiative to the three main national governing bodies, the GAA, FAI and IRFU, and will be subject to continuing assessment by the organisations and the council to ensure that targets are met and that the initiative is successful in achieving its very desirable aims.</P>
    <P>This initiative will also provide valuable guidelines on best practice for other sporting bodies in relation to increasing the number of young people in disadvantaged areas participating in sport through the provision of leadership and guidance to local groups working in the general sport and recreation areas.</P>
    <P>Under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the NDP, a sum of £85 million has been specifically allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities for 2000-06. These facilities will be located at gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Once the gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities, and where appropriate voluntary and community organisations, for the provision or upgrading of sport and recreational facilities. Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion by mid-2001, when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>if, arising from various sporting and recreational grant awards over the years, an even spread has been achieved in respect of sporting and recreational facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Over the years sport and recreational grants have been awarded on the basis of the merit of the applications submitted in meeting the criteria laid out under the guidelines, terms and conditions of the various schemes.</P>
      <P>In the assessment of the applications and the allocation of the grants every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds to benefit all types of eligible projects in all categories. Over the lifetime of this scheme it is obvious that all sectors and areas of the sports and recreation sectors have benefited greatly through the programme funding, especially as a result of the 350% increase in capital funding for the provision of sport and recreational facilities since I took office.</P>
      <P>This year, in order to further ensure a more even spread of funding throughout the country, under my Department's sports capital programme, I have adopted a policy of allocating a minimum of £200,000 per county.</P>
      <P>Early last year, my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland), a consultancy firm specialising in sports facilities, to prepare a report on the condition of local authority pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools spread around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. I then secured a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-02, an annual increase in the budget from £3 million to £15 million over these years.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives prompt consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
      <P>My Department has also committed a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a 50 metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion next year. The Government has more recently approved proceeding with development of an aqautic and leisure centre at the Campus and Stadium Ireland site at Abbotstown, work on which is expected to commence in mid 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the NDP, a sum of £85 million has been specifi<Col N="444" /> cally allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities for 2000-06.

Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion by mid-2001, when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, given the level of investment outlined, there is now under way an ambitious programme of State assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities catering for both the elite participant and the general public throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The national development plan includes an allocation of £150 million for a tourism marketing sub-programme over the period 2000-06, and consists of two separate measures, a destination marketing measure and a niche marketing measure. Decisions as to the allocation of funding under this sub-programme are a matter for Bord Fáilte, in consultation with the tourism marketing partnership, TMP, which is a special group set up within Bord Fáilte composed of Bord Fáilte executives and tourism industry representatives.

      <P>Following my announcement of the increased funding, local authorities were invited to submit proposals and in some cases to update proposals already in the Department, for the refurbishment of existing swimming pools and the construction of new pools. A total of 51 proposals were received in my Department by the closing date of 31 July 2000.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.

      <P>Work is currently in progress on the construction of new pools in Ennis, Dundalk, Gorey and Wicklow and the refurbishment of Monaghan swimming pool. Work is expected to commence on the refurbishment of Roscommon swimming pool shortly. In addition, refurbishment projects at pools in Arklow and Waterford and the construction of new pools in Enniscorthy and Navan were completed in the last year.</P>
      <P>All these projects were grant-aided by my Department.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Department has also committed a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a full competition size 50-metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 121, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Substantial funding continues to be provided by my Department to support the development of track and field sporting and recreational facilities and activities in Ireland. The increase in sports funding from £13.5 million in 1997, when this Government took office, to the all-time high of over £51 million this year, has ensured both a very considerable improvements in the quality and extent of the facilities and services available to date and lays the foundation for even greater benefits to all sports in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Capital funding for the provision of sport and recreational facilities has increased by over 350% since I took office. Recently, the Deputy will be aware, I announced the allocation of a grant of £4.8 million towards the provision of a new state of the art indoor athletics facility for Morton Stadium, Santry. This major new facility will be a boon to the all-year round training, coaching and competitive needs of Irish track and field athletes. It will also provide new administrative headquarters for the newly unified governing body of Irish athletics.</P>
      <P>In addition, substantial grants have been made towards the upgrading, refurbishment and provision of athletics facilities in Cork, Galway, Navan, Castleisland and Nenagh.</P>
      <P>Under the sports capital programme, nearly 700 clubs and organisations were allocated grants amounting to £36 million this year. This is helping to ensure that we have a network of good quality facilities around the country to meet the needs of a wide number of sports and disciplines. The planned facilities at Stadium and Campus Ireland will add to the greatly enhanced range of sophisticated, high quality facilities available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme provides funding for sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities the Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with all the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. The Department also consults with other Government Departments, local authorities and the Irish Sports Council, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment on a statutory basis with effect from 1 July 1999, the Irish Sports Council supports Irish athletics through a range of programmes, including its annual grant scheme for administration, coaching and competition and organisation development and its international <Col N="448" /> carding scheme. The question of the allocation of funds under these programmes is a matter for the council.</P>
    <P>The national coaching centre was established by the Government in 1992 to assist in raising the standards of coaching and training of coaches and to provide specialised training for elite sportsmen and women through a structured coaching system, a comprehensive sports science programme and optimal training facilities. The centre administers the national coaching development programme in partnership with NGBs and co-ordinates the provision of sports science and medical support for our leading sportsmen and women through the international carding scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Government has under way an ambitious programme of State assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities, catering for both the elite participant and the general public throughout the country.</P>

I then secured a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-02, an increase in the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million per annum over these years.</P>

Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives prompt consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
    <P>My Department has also committed a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a 50 metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion next year.</P>

Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion by mid-2001, when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in depth review of Ireland's participation in the 2000 Olympics, including the supports, programmes and schemes currently in place in order to establish how they can be best implemented to ensure a much improved performance at the 2004 Olympic games in Athens. The review will also focus on the relationships that should exist between the many agencies involved in the preparation and participation of the team. I have asked that all relevant bodies and individuals contribute to the review and I look forward to the review resulting in positive and constructive outcomes that will lead to an improvement in the performance of our competitors at national and international level, not just at the Olympics.</P>
    <P>The review, which commenced recently, will include the national coaching and training centre, the 28 national governing bodies of sport affiliated to the Olympic movement, the Olympic Council of Ireland, coaches and competitors, all of whom will be asked to contribute on the basis of their expertise and experience of these and previous Olympics.</P>

      <P>The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF), which forms part of the Government's national drugs strategy, provides funding to support the development of youth facilities, including sport and leisure facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. To date, the fund has allocated in excess of £37 million over three years to assist more than 330 projects with the primary aim of attracting young people in the targeted areas, at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more healthy pursuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of the fund is on the local drugs task force areas, where the drug problem is most acute. To date, over 90 capital projects have been approved for funding, including 49 youth facilities, 21 sports clubs and 19 community centres. In addition, over 70 youth and outreach workers are being appointed by community-based groups to work on the ground with the target group offering developmental activities and educational programmes for young people who have traditionally found themselves outside the scope of mainstream youth work due to family background, involvement with crime, drug misuse or lack of education. Five sports workers have also been appointed by the local authorities to encourage <Col N="451" /> greater involvement of the target group in sports and recreational activities.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme operated by my Department aims to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities by assisting voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation. Under the programme priority is given to the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>The 2000 sports capital programme was advertised in early December 1999 and the closing date for the receipt of application forms was 11 February 2000. Almost 1,650 applications were received and, following assessment of these applications, grants totalling £36 million were allocated to 677 projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am planning to announce the 2001 sports capital programme next month and it will be open to all groups and organisations to make an application to my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, to conduct a survey of radon levels in schools in 1998. All schools recognised by my <Col N="452" /> Department were invited to participate. The survey is being conducted in three phases. The results of phase one of the survey were released to the participating schools in January this year. County Louth was among the nine counties included in phase one. Last week, the results of phase two of the survey were released to schools in the counties participating in that phase.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000) gave effect to the most recent revision of the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive, Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM. This sets a national reference level for radon in workplaces of 400 bqMf7&gt;3 over any three month period. If radon exceeds this level an employer is obliged under this instrument to evaluate whether remedial measures should be undertaken and, if so, such measures should be undertaken as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>Four schools in County Louth had one or more rooms with maximum radon levels above 500bqMf7&gt;3. Remedial measures have been completed in two of these schools and arrangements are in hand at present to undertake remedial measures in the other two schools. A further nine schools in County Louth had one or more rooms with maximum radon levels in one or more rooms of between 204bqMf7&gt;3 and 438bqMf7&gt;3. A pilot study of the natural ventilation in ten schools within this range is under way at present. The purpose of the study is to establish whether passive ventilation systems can be used to mitigate radon levels in this range, as opposed to the mechanical systems that have been or are in the process of being installed in the schools with higher levels. The results of the study are expected in January 2001 and these will allow my Department to plan a mitigation programme for the schools with maximum radon levels in excess of 200bqMf7&gt;3 but which are not among the most severely affected schools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, schools have been advised on the simple steps to be taken to reduce radon levels in classrooms.</P>

      <P>Sporting facilities are provided and maintained by third level institutions. The extent of these facilities and the level of support staff for these varies by institution. I understand that each of the seven universities offers sports scholarships to students who are particularly talented in a sporting area. These scholarships are funded by the universities with assistance from sporting bodies and private sponsorship. I understand that there were some 184 such scholarships in the <Col N="453" /> 1998-99 academic year. In addition, a number of institutes of technology, on occasion, provide financial assistance to certain students towards the cost of participating in top-level sporting activities.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, has recently asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of the supports, programmes and schemes currently in place to establish how they can best be implemented to ensure a much improved performance in the 2004 Olympics. The review is expected to be finalised early next year and I can assure the Deputy that I will consider any recommendations of relevance to the education sector that may emerge from the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 November I announced that I was setting up immediately a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. The review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team will be asked to report by the end of March 2001.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase the rates of third level maintenance grants annually in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant and 5% in the qualifying income limits for the 2000/01 academic year.</P>
      <P>The reference value for inflation for the purpose of the annual review is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to February. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000/01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I recently established an Action Group on Access to Third Level Education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This Action Group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special <Col N="457" /> maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>With regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>

      <P>I understand that the permanent staffing levels in the school are well within quota. There are currently 147 pupils enrolled in the school, 52 at primary level and 95 at post primary level. The school has a staffing of principal plus 43 teachers, 19 primary teachers and 24 post primary teachers. A total of 12 of these positions are held in a temporary capacity.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation, school attendance committees in certain parts of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford provide the school attendance service. In the remainder of the country, including the Cherry Orchard area, the Garda Síochána provides the service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas passed the Education (Welfare) Act in July 2000. The purpose of that Act is to provide for a new structure to address problems of poor school attendance. The National Educational Welfare Board will be a key feature of that structure. That board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to treat problems of poor school attendance in individual schools. That Act also provides for the transfer of all existing school attendance officers to the National Educational Welfare Board upon the commencement of the appropriate section of the Act.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the deployment of local educational welfare officers will in the first instance be targeted at those areas of greatest educational disadvantage, and thereafter expanded to provide a national service.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the implications of the commencement of that Act. The Act itself provides that all sections must be commenced within two years of its enactment, that is, by July 2002.</P>

      <P>Due to an unforeseen career break, the level of service provided by the National Educational Psychological Service to the school named by the Deputy was not maintained in recent times. However, I am happy to inform the Deputy that a replacement psychologist has now been assigned to the school and, following discussions with the principal, will be in a position to provide a service to the school.</P>
