      <P>The next census of population will be held on Sunday, 29 April 2001. The census will cover everyone who is present in the country on census night. This accords with the definition used in previous censuses. Persons will be enumerated where they spend census night, for instance, in private households, hotels, guesthouses, hospitals, barracks etc.</P>

      <P>Messiah XXI Productions Limited has formally pledged that 10% annually up to £700,000 of any net after tax profits will go to Irish charities. This sum is equivalent to the award the company received on the recommendation of the National Millennium Committee. The millennium office has been in regular contact with Messiah XXI Productions during the year in respect of this matter. The company has advised that it is focusing on the North American market and that negotiations are ongoing with a number of broadcasting and music companies. The millennium office will continue to monitor the position on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions in the partnership agreement between Messiah XXI Productions and the National Millennium Committee in respect of the award of millennium funding is the submission of audited accounts. The company has advised that the audit on its final accounts should be available in November.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State does not seem to be able to provide information additional to that which he placed on record last February. If he peruses the reply he gave at that stage, I am sure he will agree he has not been able to obtain such information from the company which was exploring the same segment of the North American market when the Minister of State last replied to questions on this matter. Does he agree it is extraordinary that he has not been supplied with better information, bearing in mind the enormous amount of taxpayers' money which was given to this group in the first instance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a great deal more information to hand. However, discussions are ongoing between the staff of the millennium committee and the company in question. I understand that the subject of those discussions is the sale of broadcasting rights in the United States over the Christmas period. I also understand that the video is on sale through the public network broadcasting stations in the United States and Canada. To date, however, no contracts have been signed. I await publication of the audited accounts and the result of sales in the Christmas period which should provide a more comprehensive picture.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree his replies are almost identical to those he provided last February? What is happening? Has the company in question registered as a charitable trust? If so, where is that trust registered and what level of sales has been achieved to date? What information does the Minister of State have in his possession? Has the company made any sales, has it obtained any revenue and, if so, is the Minister of State in a position to outline the levels of same?</P>

      <P>The principal executive of the millennium office has been in regular contact with Messiah XXl Productions. No contracts have been signed. Discussions are ongoing with broadcasting companies in the United States and Canada. The video has been produced and the annual accounts are due in November. Even if the Deputy kept me here for four further hours I could not add to the information already supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that if he was acting as a banker or investor, he would be far from satisfied with the lack of information he is giving to other investors, namely, Irish taxpayers? Why does his staff not have the answers to the questions being asked? The Minister of State is not necessarily responsible because he did not ask those questions but somebody should have asked them. If he was on this side of the House, he would be far less sanguine than I have been in relation to the poverty of the reply he has just placed on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same as a grant from IDA Ireland or a similar grant. A total of 2,000 projects were given support and this is the only one in respect of which there is an ongoing relationship in respect of its funding. The other 1,999 projects received once-off grants. We could inquire about each of those projects and request to see their annual accounts, but we have not done so. It was decided that, because of the special circumstances involved, in the event that profits were made &ndash; audited accounts are necessary to discover whether this was the case &ndash; 10% up to £700,000 would go to Irish charities. That pledge still holds. However, until I receive the audited accounts I will not know the percentage of the profits which will be donated to charity. The accounts will be ready in November.</P>
      <P>From what I have heard, I am not hugely optimistic that a large donation of funds will be made to charity. However, over 2,000 projects in total were supported and the project in question was unanimously supported by the committee because it appeared to be of interest, given its special nature and the time of year involved. The commitment to try to recoup some of the funds means that this is the only project out of a total of 2,000 in respect of which special arrangements were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as I receive the annual accounts I will <Col N="1276" /> discover whether a profit has been made. There is no point in asking what is the company's current cashflow because I need to know what is the profit for the year. If a profit has been made for the year, 10% of it will go to the fund in question. If there is no profit &ndash; I would not hold my breath in terms of there being a profit &ndash; the matter rests there. I cannot provide further information until I receive the accounts in November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of relevance to the House. Does the Minister of State agree that if I was to submit a request under the Freedom of Information Act in relation to correspondence between his Department and the group in question, I would obtain more information than has been placed on the record of the House? He has not given a single fact, other than things he has heard. The standard of the reply given by the Minister of State is not acceptable. Annual accounts are usually available in draft form in October if they are to be audited in November.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows this. He is not doing a service to the House by placing this poverty of information on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will double check because my understanding is that all the information available to the Department is being made available to the Deputy in my reply. The company has appointed a sole agent for selling the production to broadcasters in the United States. It has not yet obtained contracts for TV broadcasting rights. Negotiations are ongoing and the appropriate time for televising the production of the event will be the Christmas period, given the nature of this production, and contracts are more likely to be signed between now and Christmas. That is all the information I have. I do not have a draft set of accounts. The Deputy is quite right in saying it would be normal to have one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to correction. I do not have a draft set of accounts but I understand one will be available in November. It may be that the company's year end is December and I will receive the November accounts as a draft. The set of accounts from outside auditors which I need, to know if the company made money will not be available to me until November. I will then gladly lay them before the House.</P>

      <Quest>the steps being taken to provide more detailed and accurate statistics in regard to tourism, particularly in relation to differentiating between journeys from abroad for commercial or family reasons and regular tourism; if the Central Statistics Office has had discussions with Bord Fáilte in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The differentiation referred to by the Deputy is already in place. Overseas visits to Ireland are classified according to the four way classification of reason for journey, which distinguishes: business; holiday, leisure and recreation; visits to friends and relatives; and other.</P>
      <P>This categorisation is based on World Tourism Organisation and EU recommendations and has been agreed with Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>When were these statistics compiled? The figures being used at present are unsound and the necessary information has not been compiled. We should compile it now while resources are available. When did Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation start compiling figures under these headings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and the Central Statistics Office have been producing this type of statistics for a number of years. They come from three sources: figures are received from transport companies; a country of residence survey is done which estimates distribution of routes by country of residence and covers approximately 274,000 people; and the CSO operates a passenger card inquiry which is used to estimate, for various areas of residence, the reason for the journey, length of stay, expenditure and fare cost.</P>
      <P>The visiting friends and relative, VFR category has been in use for a number of years. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism many years ago the categorisation VFR, as opposed to business travellers and holidaymakers, was in use. The figures are produced on a quarterly basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine the point made by the Deputy. I do not think it is a matter of funding. The figures are produced by Bord Fáilte and the Central Statistics Office from within their present funding. I am not aware of any demand <Col N="1278" /> for additional funding from the Central Statistics Office or from Bord Fáilte and I understand the Minister, Deputy McDaid, is not either. There is not a demand for additional funding. The statistics are compiled within the current budgets.</P>

      <P>A great deal of money will be available for marketing in the next few years. How can the weakest areas be targeted if proper statistics are not available?

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the knowledge among users in communities that there are waiting lists discourages them from seeking treatment as they feel they will not be accommodated and that, therefore, the waiting lists have a further knock-on effect in allowing people who are chaotic to remain in the community without seeking help? Does he agree that where there is a space of between four and six weeks between the first request for treatment by users and being admitted to programmes it is far too long, that the life of an addict is chaotic and that when they present for treatment it is vital it should be given immediately?</P>

      <P>The national drugs strategy and anything pertaining to drugs is considered by the Cabinet sub-committee. I agree with Deputy Higgins that the idea of a waiting list sends out a bad message to people who are abusing drugs. There has been an increase in the number of people in treatment from 1,300 to approximately 5,000. We are trying to move them on through rehabilitation and counselling. FÁS has ring-fenced approximately 1,000 places for people to get back into the workplace. We must try to devise a working system that allows people presenting themselves to get treatment. We are trying to achieve that. I consult with the health boards practically every week or, if not, every two weeks to ascertain what is happening on waiting lists.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister of State detail the plans being put into effect to ensure there is no waiting list and to include for treatment those not yet on the waiting list and who are perhaps reluctant to apply for treatment because of it? Does the Minister of State agree there is a major problem with the lack of rehabilitation and after care programmes by the health boards? Is he aware that in Dublin a programme has been drawn up but has not been put in place?</P>
      <P>Will he agree that rehabilitation and after care are vital in the recovery of heroin users and in the prevention of relapse? It is difficult to stay off heroin once addicted. Will he agree there is a great need for more counsellors? What plans are in place to either train or engage more counsellors for rehabilitation and after care? Will he agree that insufficient resources are put into family support for families which have heroin users in their midst? The trauma caused to families with addiction problems is well known. Addiction problems arise in some families due to dysfunction or other problems.</P>

      <P>The review of the national drugs strategy covers many of the areas to which the Deputy has referred. We have invited people in, we have had public fora and almost 200 written submissions have been received. One area in which a problem was identified was rehabilitation. Once people presented they stayed on methadone but they need to be moved on. This <Col N="1282" /> is an area that needs to be ring-fenced. FÁS has ring-fenced 1,000 places. We are looking at a variety of different measures that can be taken. For example, during the summer we launched the labour inclusion programme which provides training for people in areas in which they have a interest. Following proper training they can move into the workplace where they will have a mentor within the company to move them along. They will also have counselling. It is difficult for people who are off drugs to stay off them and I agree with the Deputy that this is a difficulty within the system.</P>
      <P>Family support is a weak area. Yesterday I launched a report in Tallaght on family support for children of drug addicts. They came up with some good proposals on how to help children and people who are misusing drugs to ensure their children are protected. I hope to see many of these measures will be put in place in the new national drugs strategy. The national drugs strategy has come from a low base. Under the previous Government it was started under the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, when there were practically no services in that area. The services have been increased and can be further increased.</P>

      <P>Given that the heroin problem in Dublin shows no sign of abating and that heroin is beginning to show up in areas outside Dublin, has the Minister of State conveyed to the Garda authorities the need to concentrate Garda anti-drug resources on heroin?

In relation to the youth facilities fund, allocations have been made which are inadequate in some instances to allow major projects, such as in the Cabra community complex in John Paul Park, to proceed. Can he say when the additional funding that is required to allow such major and badly needed projects to get under way will be provided to the project organisers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister of State is anxious to respond to some of these issues.

There should be a mechanism for raising important issues with the Minister of State but this is our only opportunity to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is a definite yes. I have spoken to the Garda about the importance of concentrating on the problem of heroin. The damage heroin does to the individuals, their families and communities is enormous&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the seizures should be increased. Within the review of the national drugs strategy, for example, Customs and Excise is introducing new passive dogs which are successful in other countries. If I remember correctly, this was announced in the newspapers about three weeks ago. They are successful in many countries and the general travelling public accept them. They are not as aggressive as the <Col N="1284" /> normal dogs used to detect drugs. That is one development.</P>
      <P>We have raised the problem of seizures. I would like to see more of them but the gardaí argue that a pound of heroin is easy to hide while other drugs are far bulkier and easier to find. However, I take the Deputy's point. I will continue to pressurise them, as I have been doing. The problems heroin causes for individuals and communities are enormous.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister of State was at the Cabinet sub-committee in July. He has not yet attended so many that he would have already forgotten who was present. Will he please tell the House who was present? Does he not agree that the Cabinet sub-committee meetings appear to be entirely <i>pro forma</i> and that the urgency that is required to have somebody to drive these programmes politically does not exist?</P>
      <P>With regard to the reply to Deputy Quinn about the extent of the problem, is it not the case that there are more than 13,000 addicts according to the best estimates and, according to the Minister of State's figures, approximately 5,000 in treatment? Is this not a matter of life and death? Are there not people dying because they cannot get places on treatment programmes? The Minister of State will be aware that a young mother of two children in my constituency died about three weeks ago because she could not get a place on a treatment programme. Is it not the case that this is not unusual? Is there not a need, therefore, for somebody to demonstrate more urgency politically about putting in place improvements in the treatment infrastructure in a situation where the heroin abuse problem in this city is now worse than it was when the task forces were first put in place in 1997?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever I talk to local groups supported by local drugs task forces, I ask them what is the up to date position. Certainly the jury is out on whether the problem is worse. Some say it is worse, while others say it is not so bad. As the Deputy knows, 13,000 is an estimated figure and no one knows how many addicts there are. One professional told me recently that he reckons the figure is approximately 9,500. I have asked for the figures to be correlated. It is very difficult to determine the exact figure because of the diffi<Col N="1285" /> culties involved in identifying people who abuse heroin.</P>
      <P>The local drugs task forces have had a positive effect in local areas and the position has stabilised. I could be wrong but I am certainly not getting the feedback from local communities that the problem is getting worse. Wherever I go I ask people to tell me honestly how they feel about the issue. As the Deputy said, this is a matter of life and death. Young and old people, their families and communities are being destroyed because of the drugs problem. I speak to the health board on a regular basis regarding waiting lists and people write to me and ring me from around the city trying to get their sons or daughters into treatment. We do everything we possibly can to facilitate people. The health board is trying to open four or five more treatment centres. Given the new buses that are coming on stream, there should be a service that, I hope, will meet existing demand. If the demand is not met, the health board will have to open more centres. There are currently approximately 50 centres throughout the city.</P>

      <P>I can get the Deputy a more detailed answer. The Garda told us there was not a heroin problem on the ground that it knew of and when heroin moves into an area it is easy to identify. We heard reports of heroin in the area but there is no concrete proof. We heard there was heroin in Athlone and Limerick and we sought reports which were inconclusive. In cities such as Glasgow where the heroin problem affected the inner city and housing estates in the most excluded areas, there was a strong response from the state agencies and local communities. The problem was addressed but it migrated to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be ahead of the game and I would hate if dealers found it was easier and more lucrative to move to other parts of Ireland. There are proposals on the table to try to address that in <Col N="1288" /> the new drugs strategy. We must be very mindful of that because it happened in Scotland.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State agree that to enable the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion to pursue an effective strategy, it needs accurate information on the extent of heroin addiction in Ireland? It is a major problem if that information is not available &ndash; the Minister of State said nobody really knows the position. Does the Minister of State agree this arises because of the nature of the problem, which is that it involves people who are outside mainstream society?</P>
      <P>Young people who are vulnerable to heroin addiction will not be driven home from All-Ireland finals in ministerial Mercs. Therefore, does the Minister of State agree it is crucial that there is a huge degree of flexibility in assessing the extent of the problem and in engaging with those who are at risk? In that regard, does the Minister of State agree there is a need&mdash;</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy McManus's query, we are considering drugs such as Naltrexone. There has been positive feedback in countries such as Portugal and Spain where young addicts have received it. The family is included in the treatment process. A family member gives the Naltrexone in the morning and if the young person does not take it, alarm bells immediately begin to ring. Naltrexone is an inhibitor, which means that if a person takes heroin or any other drug, it will have no effect. We are considering international best practice, but one of the disappointing aspects is that very few answers are available on the international scene with regard to tackling the problem. There are no wonder drugs, although Naltrexone appears to have had positive results internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Higgins's point, the national advisory committee on drugs was established to address the problem he mentioned in relation to accuracy of information about what is happening <Col N="1289" /> on the ground. The community and voluntary sec- tor demanded such a body for many years. It is up and running and has held its first meeting. It will be a welcome addition in the fight against drugs. It will be in a position to get good and accurate information. It has a good budget and it appears happy to deal with the challenge it has been given.</P>
    <P>Many of the local drugs task forces have already submitted plans for outreach workers. Such workers are operational on the ground. There is a need to get out there and talk to young people in the community who are not presenting for treatment to ensure they do not develop serious drug problems. There is a need to develop relationships with them. A recent report, Choosers or Losers, was carried out by Paula Mayock in an inner city community. She spent a year working on the report and the information she got because young people trusted and responded to her was enormously helpful. She got much good information on young people's attitudes to drugs. I agree with the Deputy that outreach workers are a most important element.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department ensures the updating of information detailing the business interests of members of the tourism product development management boards, which are responsible for the allocation of EU funds.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21189/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1994, the then Minister for Tourism and Trade established two independent management boards for product development &ndash; one in respect of the Bord Fáilte area and the other covering the Shannon Development area. These product development management boards had responsibility for making decisions on applications for capital grant assistance under the product development sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The membership of the boards consisted of three independent business-professional members, two representatives of the implementing agencies, that is, Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development, and one official from the then Department of Tourism and Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 10.5 of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 provides that &ldquo;all members of the relevant decision-making authority shall ensure that they do not participate in adjudicating on grant applications in which a potential conflict of interest arises&rdquo;. On the appointment of the boards, each member was supplied with a copy of the terms of reference of the board, the code of conduct for the board and <Col N="1290" /> a disclosure of information form. Members were asked to complete the disclosure forms and return them to the chairperson of the relevant board for onward transmission to the Secretary General of the then Department of Tourism and Trade. In the case of a vacancy arising, a newly appointed board member would also have been furnished with these documents.</P>
    <P>The code of conduct for management boards clearly states that it is the duty of each board member to ensure that if and when a potential conflict of interest arises, he or she will take the necessary action to ensure that no actual conflict ensues. The code also states that a member should absent himself or herself when the board is deliberating or deciding on matters in which he or she or a person or body connected with them has an interest.</P>
    <P>Both Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development have confirmed to me that on the few occasions when a potential conflict of interest arose the procedure I have just outlined applied and was recorded in the minutes of the relevant meetings. Consequently, I am satisfied that every step was taken by the management boards to ensure that any potential conflict of interest was dealt with in the appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>As regards the disclosure of information forms, in June 1999 my Department wrote to each member of the independent boards for product development and sought an updating of their original disclosure form. Updating was not necessary where up-to-date declaration of interest forms existed in the context of individual board members' official capacity, either as a member of the board or executive of Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development or as a civil servant under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>How much funding was allocated by those boards over the past four years? Given that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, obliges members of the board to disclose their business interests and that there is an obligation on the Department to ensure that such lists of interests are provided to the Department through Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, have the terms of the legislation been followed in all cases? If the terms of the legislation were not followed, how would we know if there was a potential conflict of interest? </P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The boards have responsibility for approximately £100 billion of EU funds over the period. The regulations and rules appertaining to those boards were followed at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Were full declarations of interest supplied by the members to Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development on an annual basis over the past four years? Is the Minister stating that the terms of the legislation were followed in all instances? </P>

      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy is asking. The boards were appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Kenny. I have worked at all times with the board and its chairman. The members are people of integrity. To my knowledge, all members of the product development boards filled in the forms of declarations. The stipulation that it had to be filled in on a yearly basis may not have been followed, but that only arose when new members were appointed to the board on a few occasions. When it became clear that the forms should be updated, one official stated it was not necessary but that was overruled. The Secretary General of the Department informed the board in 1999 that members must show a declaration of interest. The board members had no problem filling in that declaration of interest. It appears everything was above board in terms of the declarations of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 included a provision towards the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up <Col N="1292" /> to 2,000 delegates. In November 1998 the European Commission gave its approval in principle for a grant of 33 million ECU or £26 million, subject to a number of conditions, including the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules. Subsequently, having secured Commission confirmation on permissible time limits for the grant draw down, contract documentation was agreed and signed by Bord Fáilte and the developer, Spencer Dock Consortium Limited, by the end of December last year.</P>
    <P>Planning permission for the development, issued by Dublin Corporation in August 1999, was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Last July, An Bord Pleanála issued its decision granting planning permission for the national conference centre element of the overall development but not for the bulk of the surrounding development. Since then, the developers have been considering their options in light of this planning decision. Options, of which I have been made aware, would require the provision of substantial additional public funding over and above the terms of the original grant offer from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Following consultations with Bord Fáilte and advice from the Attorney General, I am precluded from introducing any amendments to the public procurement process through which the Spencer Dock proposal emerged and the grant offer of £26 million was made. I have now informed the developers accordingly and asked them to continue to consider with Bord Fáilte how to proceed within the context of the terms and conditions of the existing grant offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin" hpid="Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>What contact has the Minister had with the developers of the Spencer Dock development and what was the outcome of such contact? The Minister said there is a request for more funding. How much more funding is being requested? Has the Minister received a copy of the contract between the developers and CIE from the Minister for Public Enterprise and what was included in that document? How much money has been expended to date on the development? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any contact with the developers. I met them previously but my contacts to date have been with Bord Fáilte. The Deputy asked how much was sought by the developers to continue with the development. However, that is sensitive information. This matter is not yet at an end. A contract has been signed between Bord Fáilte and the developers. It is a complex legal agreement and it involves a public procurement process and State aids. I am sorry it involves such legal complexities. I am precluded from stating how much more the developers are seeking. They are seeking further funding from the Exchequer. The Attorney General's advice is that this is a complex legal issue involving public procurement and State aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developers need to conclude their business <Col N="1293" /> with Bord Fáilte. I assure the Deputy the Government remains fully committed to a national conference centre. This city, country and hoteliers require such a centre if we want to continue to meet the demands of people coming to this country. We will continue to give that commitment.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the contract with CIE, which is quite complex, but it would appear that under the conditions of the contract the developers have an agreement with CIE for the site in the docklands area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £26 million in grant aid has been allocated, which is Exchequer money. The Deputy will recall that the grant aid was originally EU funding but so as not to lose the EU funding, the Government made a decision to transfer the £26 million, which we were given permission to do by the EU. To date, no money has been given. The grant aid is £26 million in Exchequer funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this situation is a total fiasco, that he has lost his way and this project has lost its way? It was included in a Fianna Fáil manifesto. Is the Minister as confident now as he was even six months ago that this project will go ahead? The Minister gave us lip service about the need for the country to have a conference centre. What is the alternative now in relation to this fiasco that he led us into?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains totally committed to the conference centre. I have already stated that it is a complex legal issue as to where it stands but we will continue to pursue it. I would encourage the developers to continue to work with Bord Fáilte to iron out the contract aspects, which are complex, but I will not have a plan B until the developers and Bord Fáilte get together and work out the contract already signed between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that the country will have a national conference centre? Are we in danger of losing the EU element of that funding? How much time do the developers have to finally decide whether to go ahead in Spencer Dock or whether we need a plan B? Some time ago I <Col N="1294" /> asked the Minister if he had a plan B and he told me he did not. Will he agree it is now time to consider plan B?</P>

      <P>As I have already stated, it remains for the developers and Bord Fáilte to come together and work out the contract agreement they have in place. I can do nothing until they come together and make a decision one way or the other. There is no Exchequer funding. No money has been lost because this was an EU grant which the Government managed to persuade the EU to give to this development. The grant has not been lost. The funding was already transferred and this grant aid, which is currently in place, is Exchequer money. No Exchequer money has been forthcoming for anything in this area to date.</P>

      <P>If one has contact with major developers, I can imagine what the Deputy would be saying. A contract has been signed between two bodies to go ahead with the development of the conference centre. Unfortunately, all the developers' needs were not allowed by An Bord Pleanála and consequently they said that they were unable to go ahead with the project unless the Government provided extra Exchequer funding. I have been informed by the Attorney General that in view of the legal complexity of the situation, the Government cannot give further Exchequer funding because a contract has been signed. Other people were in this competition and it could be seen as the Government giving extra funding to this development which would be totally unfair to the other competitors in this area. The developers have not said that they are no longer interested in this project. They have not abandoned it but I can do nothing until the developers and Bord Fáilte agree one way or the other with regard to their contract.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has to hold meetings with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Athletics Association of Ireland in relation to their public disagreements during the Sydney Olympics.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21190/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of the supports, programmes and schemes currently in place to establish what needs to be done in light of the Sydney 2000 experience to prepare for the games in Athens in 2004. I have asked that invitations issue to the 28 national governing bodies of sport affiliated to the Olympic movement, including the Athletics Association and the Olympic Council of Ireland, among others, to participate in the review. I hope all the bodies invited will be able to contribute constructively to the review and use the opportunity to air opinions, including any relating to differences which may have arisen in the course of Sydney 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to Sydney, I stated in the House, when responding to questions regarding the dispute between the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Athletic Association of Ireland about the gear to be worn by the athletic members of the Irish <Col N="1297" /> Olympic team, that such disputes do nothing to serve the cause of Irish sport. While it would be far preferable if such unseemly disputes did not arise, nevertheless, the responsibility for their resolution rests with the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I consider it particularly unfortunate that these differences continued to be aired publicly in the lead up to the Sydney Games when all of the energies of the organisations in question should have been expended in the preparation of the Irish athletic team for the games. While I would be slow to say that the fall out from the dispute contributed to the eventual underperformance of our team, it certainly can have done nothing to help matters.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, strongly urge the Athletics Association and the Olympic Council of Ireland, in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council and in the context of the aforementioned review, to restore their working relationship, which, unfortunately, has been fractured for some time, to the more positive footing so necessary for the proper preparation of our team for future Olympic Games.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister join with me in congratulating all the athletes who represented Ireland in Sydney? Will he also condemn the manner in which the athletes were used as pawns in a power game between the blazer brigades of different associations? Will he explain what the term &ldquo;second rate athletes&rdquo; means, given that he was reported as having used that terminology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister checks the newspapers, he will note he was reported as using that term. Will he take a proactive approach, as the Minister with responsibility for sport, to bring together these associations and remind them they are in receipt of taxpayers' money and have a responsibility to spend that money in a proper manner? Will he also tell them that he condemns, in the strongest possible manner, the public squabbling that went on in Sydney and here afterwards? Will he condemn the manner in which the athletes were once again used as hostages and scapegoats in a power game between the blazer brigades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Deputy in congratulating the athletes who participated in Sydney and I agree with many of his comments. I would, however, like him to retract his remark that I was the one responsible for calling any athlete a second class athlete. That term was used by the president of the Olympic Council. I was disappointed about the headline of the article to which the Deputy referred. I was quoted in the article as saying that &ldquo;when I visited the Olympic village there was certainly no lack of commitment and certainly no lack of their sense of national pride&rdquo;. Given that I said that, I cannot understand how <Col N="1298" /> that article was given a headline that I was investigating an Olympic flop. I was appalled at the way our athletes were treated in Sydney. A number of Deputies have tabled questions on this issue and I will be able to reply to them shortly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the unseemly squabbling reported by the media, I wish to clarify there is no squabbling between the Sports Council, Athletics Ireland, the national organisations of sport, the NCTC and me. We are on the one side and get on very well. There is a problem with the Olympic Council of Ireland, of which I am sure the Deputy is aware. No one seems to be able to manage to get on with that organisation, particularly given the attitude taken by its president. Until we are able to do something about this specific issue, the Olympic movement here, under its current leadership, will leave much to be desired. Despite the promises after the Atlanta Games that everything would be smoothed over for Sydney and that what happened in Atlanta would never happen again, I envisage similar promises will be made on this occasion. Unless something is done by the organisations of the Olympic movement here, I would be concerned about this ongoing situation in the lead up to the next games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the headlines I read. I do not want to reflect on the Minister's attitude to our athletes. Will he agree that it seems everybody is out of step except our Paddy? Will he take the initiative and meet the federations under the umbrella of the Olympic Council to eliminate what is an ongoing cancer in Irish sport, which is seriously damaging the good name of Irish sport at home and abroad? Will he set himself the task of sorting out the internal problems of Olympic Council of Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something wrong in an organisation when one of it members decides that because he does not agree with others involved in the whole area of sport that he must punish them. The way our athletes were treated was outrageous and I agree with the Deputy they were used as pawns. The way they were treated compared to other sectors and personnel who were out in Sydney was outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the number of athletes we bring to the games determines the amount of accreditation that is brought to them. What happened in Sydney was an eye-opener to me. Many people, including coaches, deserved accreditation. Only four of our coaches were given accreditation to look after 36 athletes. That happened across all spheres of sport. The manner in which our Ambassador there was treated on a number of occasions was embarrassing. Given <Col N="1299" /> that athletics accounts for 50% of our participants in the games, it was embarrassing that the president of Athletics Ireland was not included in the group.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues also arose. There is something wrong in an organisation when a member of it can use his power and influence to bring about such a debacle.</P>

      <P>Social inclusion and child care sub-programmes included in both regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan include a local development measure. This measure requires local action plans to be drawn up by partnership companies and ADM community groups, in consultation with the director of community and enterprise of the relevant city and county development boards. A significant number of these plans have already been submitted to Area Development Management Limited and are being evaluated by ADM's appraisal committees for the southern and eastern region and for the Border, midlands and western region.

      <P>The feasibility study, A Stadium for the New Century, was prepared by a consortium led by PricewaterhouseCoopers and 60 copies of the report were submitted to the stadium steering committee which was established by the Government to oversee the preparation of the feasibility study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following acceptance of the study by the Government it was subsequently laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and made available on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach. <Col N="1302" /> It was also made available to interested parties and persons who requested it.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the launch of the study the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I briefed the major national governing bodies of sport including the Community Games on its contents and they were unanimous in their welcome of it. Since its publication there has been a broad positive public response to the study and I am confident that public support will continue to grow as the various elements of the project become a reality. Earlier this year the Government appointed a development company, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, which would have responsibility for taking the Sports Campus Ireland project through the design and construction stages.</P>
    <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, estimates that the cost of the development of the total campus and stadium project to be in the region of £550 million, to be funded from a combination of private sector and public sector moneys. This covers the cost of an 80,000 seat stadium, where the cost remains at £281 million, as outlined in the feasibility study, including a private contribution of £50 million; a series of general sports use facilities, including an aquatic and leisure centre, an indoor arena, multipurpose indoor and outdoor training halls and pitches, a sports science-sports medicine centre, headquarters for sports organisations including the Community Games and a visitor information centre; some specific use facilities for individual sports to be decided on the advice of the Irish Sports Council; the cost of the infrastructure on the Abbotstown site and the operating costs of CSID.</P>
    <P>CSID estimates that of the total cost of £550 million, the return related and fully funded private sector elements are in the region of £150 million, taking account of the £50 million private sector donation. The remaining public sector cost is estimated to be in the region of £350 million. The cost of relocation of relocating public servants currently working at Abbotstown, is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>CSID has already put in place an executive services management team, based in offices at Blanchardstown near the Abbotstown site, to take the project forward. Appointed on the basis of a publicly advertised competition, this team will provide a full range of executive, property, financial, marketing, planning, environmental and communications services to the company. It is headed by Magahy &amp; Co. Ltd. and comprises PricewaterhouseCoopers, Wilson Hartnell Public Relations, McHugh Consultants, Thorbourn Colquhoun, Seamus Monaghan &amp; Partners and Mr. Ronnie Delany. The team will work with the Office of Public Works, who will provide the project management function for the infrastructure of Sports Campus Ireland. The cost of the executive services team has been capped at 1.8% of the development cost.</P>
    <P>CSID intends to undertake the development of <Col N="1303" /> the sports facilities on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. This will, in effect, involve a series of public-private partnerships with financial contributions from the private sector based on the returns they estimate for the facilities. CSID will also seek proposals for fully private sector funded facilities on the Abbotstown site and intends to work closely with local community organisations and take on board community projects in developing the site. I have had no contacts personally with parties in the Fingal County Council area regarding developments at the Abbotstown site.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved proceeding with the development of an aquatic and leisure centre at the Sports Campus Ireland site. The awarding authority for the competition to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the aquatic and leisure centre is Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited and information about the number of requests to participate is a day-to-day administrative matter for the company. However, following the publicly advertised competition and after an initial assessment by CSID and the Office of Public Works, five consortia from Ireland and abroad were invited to make outline bids by 9 October. It is intended that the heads of agreement will have been reached with a developer for the aquatic and leisure centre by the end of this year and that construction work on the aquatic and leisure centre is expected to commence in mid-2001 and must be completed by end 2002 to enable the Special Olympics to be held there in summer 2003. CSID will, between now and the end of the year, put the other facilities for Sports Campus Ireland out to tender, using the same procedures as for the aquatic and leisure centre.</P>
    <P>The feasibility study A Stadium for the New Century provides a five year timescale for the completion of the stadium. CSID has recently published advertisements outlining the terms of a competition to develop an architectural and environmental framework plan for the entire site, which comprises 500 acres. The winning framework plan will suggest a logical and coherent approach to accommodating Sports Campus Ireland, a major parkland amenity to serve the community and general public, a major science and educational project and complementary commercial and leisure projects with respect to the built and natural heritage that exists at Abbotstown. As soon as the results of the architectural and environmental framework plan competition are available &ndash; which is expected by year end &ndash; a more precise timescale for the development can be established.</P>
    <P>In addition to the feasibility study A Stadium for the New Century, prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers, I understand that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited has commissioned a number of other smaller studies for an aquatic and leisure centre, Arena Ireland, a sports science and medical centre, multi-purpose halls and outdoor pitches and a tennis centre. <Col N="1304" /> CSID will use these different studies as inputs to the competitive tenders to the design, build, finance, operate and maintain process and in those circumstances it would not be appropriate to publish these studies.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the £550 million figure quoted &ndash; it has gone from £280 million to £550 million &ndash; as a cost, does not include the relocation of veterinary research laboratories and the Marine Institute at a cost of £90 million, as set out in a reply to a previous parliamentary question, the development of road infrastructure and rail and bus services and cost escalation? Will the Minister confirm that our national stadium does not contain an athletics track? Will he let us know if the VAT element of the project is included in the £550 million? What does he estimate the cost escalation will be over the four year period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The answer to the second part is that the infrastructure in the area, as has already been pointed out, has been the subject of a significant amount of funding in the national development plan which will be to the benefit of the communities in that area.</P>
      <P>The stadium does not include an athletics track because, as the Deputy is aware, we are continuing the development of Morton Stadium. I recently grant aided to the tune of £4.8 million a new indoor facility at that venue. Even in Stadium Australia in Sydney they are about to dig up the athletics track because there is no further need for it because athletics as a spectator sport would not need an 80,000 seat stadium. They are taking up their track there.</P>
      <P>There are two points about the VAT issue. Public private partnerships will be involved in all aspects of the stadium. Every section of the stadium will go to a public private partnership. Therefore, the private sector will certainly be taking over a certain section of the VAT area. I also inform the Deputy, because this arose before, that this specific issue is a matter of ongoing discussion&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that standing over the figure of £281 million for the stadium at this point is not the approach which should be taken when the Minister's feasibility study showed that, of the 15 stadia examined, the average cost overrun was £73.4 million? Does the Minister have a ballpark figure in the context of infrastructural works, such as the railway connection and terminal and roads servicing the site? Has any plan been drawn up to deal with traffic coming to the site similar to the plans the FAI has formulated for Eircom Park? Some 80,000 people converging on one site is a huge number. The FAI anticipated this and has plans for dealing with it. Are we proceeding with a stadium project where no detailed environmental impact assessment has been carried out to support it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Every matter concerning the environmental issues and problems which arise when one tries to bring 80,000 people to and from a specific venue will be worked out with the stadium development committee. We are spending £40 million in the national development plan and a large amount of that has been earmarked for that specific area of north Dublin.</P>
      <P>I sometimes cannot understand the two points of the argument. If we were to invest £1 billion in sport, it would not of necessity be enough. We are not talking about that amount of money but it would be 1% of the funding available under the national development plan.</P>

      <P>On the issue of public private partnerships and the role of tax benefits which will be given to the private sector to take a stake in this, obviously that will be a tax liability in years to come. The Minister said it was between CSID and the Revenue Commissioners to agree on VAT. That would not be the case because, under law, it is not something about which there can be arbitration. It should be relatively simple to work out if there will be a VAT reclaim on the development and whether it is VAT inclusive or exclusive. The Minister spoke of giving the consultants 1.8% in fees. What stages of payment are involved? This involves fees of £15 million. Are there any guarantees or is it a no foal no fee situation? Has a contract been signed with the consultants for the fees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement has been made with the consultants, which I have mentioned, that it will be no more than 1.8%. Those are the agreed terms with the consultants. Regarding VAT, in circumstances such as these the Revenue Commissioners are in consultation with CSID on the issue of VAT. I have tried to find the information for Deputies on this specific matter because it was raised on the previous occasion and I only relate the information I have received. In a public private partnership the private sector would be liable for a certain amount of the VAT, as is usually the case. An encouraging part of the process is that when we invited tenders for the construction of the aquatic and leisure centre, there was no lack of private sector companies interested in getting a piece of the action because they saw the future potential of sport. Each of the sections to which I already referred &ndash; the medical and scientific areas, the parkland area, etc. &ndash; will be located on the 500 acre site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21, 25, 26, 39, 40, 43 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, I congratulate the members of the Irish team who reached the various qualifying standards which entitled them to represent us at the Olympic Games. As Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I was delighted to be in the stadium to witness an outstanding performance by Sonia O'Sullivan in winning the silver medal in the 5,000 metres. In addition, there were many other fine performances by our team which included the setting of new Irish records and the achievement of new personal bests.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt, however, that in spite of their best efforts the under performance of many of Ireland's competitors in Sydney was a source of disappointment, particularly to the athletes themselves who made so many sacrifices during the past three and a half years to qualify for the games. In the light of the substantially increased investment in structural and financial support for sport in recent years, it is a matter of particular importance that these resources are spent in a manner that assists our athletes to achieve their full potential when performing at the Olympics and other major international events.</P>
      <P>I have already asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of the supports, programmes and schemes currently in place to establish how they can be best implemented to ensure a much improved performance in the next three to four years. It is intended that the review will include the National Coaching and Training Centre, the 28 national governing bodies of sport affiliated to the Olympic movement, the Olympic Council of Ireland, coaches and competitors, all of whom will be asked to contribute on the basis of their expertise and experience of these and previous Olympics.</P>
      <P>While I have had differences with the Olympic Council of Ireland in the past, as far as I am concerned, I ensured that our relationship was not an issue in Sydney and would not impinge on our athletes during the games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, I was for several <Col N="1311" /> months in the lead up to this year's Olympic Games, in contact with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the relevant athletics organisation urging the resolution of their difficulties in relation to the gear to be worn by Ireland's athletes in Sydney. The matter was satisfactorily settled in June last. Subsequently, in the days preceding the games, I sought accreditation for attendance at the games in respect of a ministerial delegation of three, on the assumption that the chief executive of the Irish Sports Council, John Treacy, would receive accreditation in his own right. When this did not materialise, I arranged for one of the three ministerial delegation accreditations to issue to Mr. Treacy so that the Irish Sports Council could be formally represented.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The question of accreditation for attendance at future Olympic Games remains a matter for the International Olympic Council and the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards relations with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Athletics Association of Ireland, my Department and the Sports Council will continue to discharge their respective responsibilities in a fair and even handed manner, with the interests of Irish sport always to the fore. I hope that notwithstanding difficulties in the past, and learning from the experience of Sydney 2000, all our sports bodies can now go on to work effectively, efficiently and professionally together, for the advancement of Irish athletics.</P>
    <P>Recent developments such as the launch of the Sport's Council's three year development strategy for Irish sport; creation of a strong new governing body for Irish athletics; and the major investment recently announced for Morton Stadium, together create the potential for a new exciting era in Irish athletics. I hope the outcome of the review of Ireland's performance at the recent Olympics already referred to, will ensure that we are well on the way to realising that potential by Athens 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>How much funding has been allocated to the OCI in the past three years? How many OCI members and their entourages travelled to the Olympic Games and how much did this cost in terms of public funding? Will the Minister consider withdrawing funding from the OCI until those responsible for running it come to their senses and start talking to the people who are of greatest importance, namely, the athletes? The OCI should not shame us again in the way it has done during the past three Olympic Games. There should not be a recurrence of the recent events we witnessed in Sydney. Will the Minister withdraw public funding from the OCI until it enters discussions?</P>

      <P>The amount of money given to the Olympic disciplines was just over £3 million. In addition, the Exchequer provided money for <Col N="1312" /> all of the training camps, pre-games training camps and accommodation and this amounted to £250,000. There was also a sum of £1.162 million given to the athletes themselves in direct grant aid.</P>
      <P>As already stated, an unseemly row has developed with one central figure. I assure the Deputy that I will do everything possible to further the best interests of sport. I also assure her that I will not turn a blind eye to events I witnessed in Sydney which have been part and parcel of the Olympic movement's behaviour under its current leadership in recent years.

Does the Tánaiste agree it is important that Members be seen to act together to express our support for the tribunal and our condemnation of any Member who fails to co-operate with a duly appointed tribunal? Does she agree that the House should pass such a resolution, if necessary without debate, because I am sure there would be no disagreement in condemning Deputy Lawlor's behaviour?</P>

I very much regret what has happened and I share the views expressed. However, clearly this is a matter for the tribunal and, from what Deputy Bruton said, for the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is not a matter for me or this House. I regret that a Member of the House is not prepared to co-operate with a tribunal established by the Members of this House.</P>

        <b>:</b> There are several pirate radio stations throughout the country flouting the law and operating with total impugnity. Attention was drawn to the need to update the outdated legislation dealing with pirate radio stations by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation when she addressed the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on 6 April.

There are 21 Bills in section B, the heads of which have been agreed and the text is being drafted, in respect of 20 of which an indicative date is given as to when the Bill might be presented. There is one exception, the Central Bank Bill, the heads of which have been drafted and approved by Cabinet, in respect of which it is stated that it is not possible to indicate at this stage when it will be presented. Will the Tánaiste enlighten the House as to why this is the case and whether she has anything to do with it? Will the Company Law (Consolidation) Bill, included in section C, the heads of which have not yet been approved by Cabinet, deal with the problem which seems to be holding her up in publishing the reports on the inquiries which she required to be conducted at considerable taxpayers' expense into the affairs of various companies? Is she holding these back for some purpose and, if so, what is the purpose? Is there a legal impediment to her publishing the reports and, if so, what is the legal impediment, or is it the case that the Tánaiste wants to tantalise everybody by being the only person in the House who knows all this information and is not yet willing to share it with the public who paid for it?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Bruton is aware, the Company Law (Consolidation) Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with inquiries. Nobody in this House can break the law and commit a criminal act, which is what the Deputy seems to be asking me to do. I am prohibited from publishing the reports in question. It would be a criminal offence to reveal information contained in them. Two of the reports, those relating to the IIB and Ansbacher, have been presented to Mr. Justice Costello and the inspectors. Others are being completed. Two inquiries into the NIB are before the High Court. There are High Court inspectors who report to the High Court, not to me. I presume they will be published. It is wrong to say that they have cost an enormous amount of taxpayers' money &ndash; in comparison with other inquiries they have cost relatively little. With the best will in the world and notwithstanding the outstanding work done by the authorised officer, it has not been possible to have reports published and brought to finality in a way that they can be brought into the public domain. That will happen in the appropriate forum as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>My question is about promised legislation. Despite the plundering by the Minister for Health and Children of Third World countries to bring in skilled nurses we still have a problem. The Nursing Bill has been on the legislative programme for some time. Since a new initiative is needed and the Bill would assist in that regard, will the Tánaiste indicate when it will be published? We were promised that the Bill would be published in late 1999. We were then promised it would not be published before late 1999. In a further legislative programme we were promised it would be published in the middle of 2000. We were then promised it would be pub<Col N="1321" /> lished in late 2000. In the most recent legislative programme we have been told it is not to be expected before the middle of 2001. Will the Tánaiste say when the Bill will be introduced to the House and when we can start to deal with the crisis in nursing, which is affecting people's lives?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on the mutual enforcement of judgments on rights of access to children (O.J. No. C234, 15,8.00, p.7) copies of which proposed measure were laid before Dáil Éireann on 3 October 2000.</P>
      <P>The need for this motion arises because of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution which enabled Ireland to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty and allowed the State to exercise certain options contained in that Treaty including the option in the fourth Protocol. Under the terms of the constitutional amendment, such exercise is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into operation on 1 May 1999, added to the EC Treaty a new Title IV which deals with visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free <Col N="1327" /> movement of persons including judicial co-operation in civil matters. The fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty establishes the positions of Ireland and the United Kingdom in relation to the issues arising under Title IV. Its effect is to exempt both countries from all the provisions of Title IV but to permit either or both to opt into particular measures under the terms and conditions set out in the Protocol. Under article 3 of the Protocol, the State has three months from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council of Ministers to notify our wish to take part in the adoption and application of the measure. We may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the conference which adopted the Amsterdam Treaty took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under article 3 of the Protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area with the United Kingdom. It follows from this that our predisposition in relation to measures such as the one we are now discussing is to participate in their adoption. This will be the seventh occasion on which the approval of both Houses will have been sought for the State to exercise the option provided in the fourth Protocol in respect of a proposal for an EU legal instrument.</P>
    <P>Under Article 65 of the Amsterdam Treaty, judicial co-operation in civil matters includes, among other things, measures aimed at improving and simplifying the recognition and enforcement of decisions in civil and commercial cases. Formerly, judicial co-operation in civil matters was dealt with under the Third Pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, which was largely intergovernmental in nature. The Amsterdam Treaty changed that by including this subject in the EC Treaty, that is the First Pillar. For a transitional period of five years from the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty member states share with the Commission the right to table initiatives. The draft regulation we are now discussing is an example of a proposal made by a member state, in this case France which, as it happens, currently hold the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the presentation of this measure by France to the Council, is that if the State wishes to opt in to its adoption we have until 13 October to inform the President of the Council of our intentions. Failure to opt in at this time does not prevent us from participating in relevant meetings of the Council working parties which will discuss these proposals. However, we would not be able to opt in until the negotiations were concluded and the measure adopted and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited.</P>
    <P>In October 1999 the European Council at a meeting in Tampere, Finland, on the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice, <Col N="1328" /> highlighted the need to establish a genuine European judicial area. In that regard, the Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments. Judgments in the area of family litigation, including those relating to access rights, were considered by the European Council as being appropriate for early action to promote this principle.</P>
    <P>This draft regulation aims to ensure the effective exercise in one member state of rights of access ordered in another member state and the return of the child to the custodial parent once rights of access have been exercised. The scope of the regulation as it stands is confined to children of a marriage. The regulation addresses the right of children to maintain regular contact with both parents, whatever the parents' place of residence. The draft regulation is essentially a modification of the Brussels II Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of joint parental responsibility for children. Article 14 of the draft regulation provides that Brussels II shall apply to the judgments covered save where otherwise provided in this draft.</P>
    <P>The principal features of the draft regulation are: first, it relates to children of a marriage who are under the age of 16 when enforcement of a judgment is sought; second, a judgment on rights of access which has been given and is enforceable in a member state, even provisionally, can be enforced in any other member state without the need to obtain a declaration of enforceability in the latter State. This is a derogation from Brussels II which requires a declaration of enforceability; third, enforcement of the access order may only be suspended in limited circumstances, namely, if enforcement of the order would put the child's interests at serious risk or if there is another enforceable judgment which is irreconcilable. However, while enforcement may only be suspended in these circumstances, the custodial parent can bring proceedings for a decision that the order should not be recognised or enforced on the grounds set out in the Brussels II regulation but, unless and until the court decides in the custodial parent's favour, the order will not be suspended and will continue to be enforced; fourth, if the child is not returned to the parent with custody rights at the end of the period of access, the custodial parent may apply in the host state for the prompt return of the child and the court must order the return of the child notwithstanding grounds of local jurisdiction or grounds under the Hague convention on child abduction, to which Ireland is a party, which may exist for refusal and, finally, central authorities are to be established by member states to exchange information, to encourage voluntary return of children and to arrange any necessary legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>This measure will supplement existing international and EU law in the area. Many Deputies will already be aware that Ireland is, along with <Col N="1329" /> the other EU states, a party to the Hague and Council of Europe conventions on child abduction which provide for the return of children to the place from which they have been wrongfully abducted by a parent and also cover the case where a child is wrongfully retained under access arrangements in another state. Those conventions, particularly the Hague convention, which are administered by my Department, have operated with considerable success over the years. A difficulty with the Hague convention is that, although it is intertwined with international abduction cases, it does not adequately address the problem of enforcing access rights.</P>
    <P>Certain of those difficulties are addressed in the 1996 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children. Ireland has taken a leading role among EU states and elsewhere by bringing forward legislation to enable ratification of that convention. Australia and New Zealand are preparing similar legislation. Our legislation is the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill that is at present before the Seanad, having been passed by this House. The EU proposal we are now discussing is framed in a different way from the 1996 convention and is confined to children of a marriage. Nevertheless, the EU initiative proposed by France is indicative of the importance that attaches to the subject of access orders.</P>
    <P>Having been presented to the Council of Ministers, work on the draft regulation is now to proceed in a Council working party and the outcome of negotiations in the Council framework will be submitted in due course for decision by the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. It is fair to say that, based on the discussions which have taken place to date, two aspects of the proposal which are giving rise to some concern on the part of at least some member states are, first, the provision that a declaration of enforceability will not be necessary in the requested state and, second, the exact circumstances in which enforcement of an order can be suspended. It is clear that a good deal of revision of the regulation will be required before it is acceptable in full to member states, including Ireland. I will take account of points that may be made by Deputies on any aspect of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Opting in at this stage does not imply that we will approve of everything in the proposal as it now stands but it gives us the scope to participate to maximum effect in the development of the measure. It is important that Ireland respond positively by exercising our right to opt in now so we can play a full and constructive part in the negotiations at working party level and, ultimately, in the Justice and Home Affairs Council. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in his approach of opting in as opposed to opting out. It is most important that we have co-operative arrangements in place on a Europe wide basis not only to ensure the enforcement of custody orders relating to children but to ensure that where <Col N="1330" /> courts in one member state make access or contact orders to provide that a child primarily in the care of one parent spends time with the other parent, those orders will be complied with.</P>
      <P>The draft regulation states something of crucial importance which is sometimes lost in the midst of marital or parental conflict and when relationships break down, that is, that access rights relate to the rights of children, not primarily the rights of parents. Each parent should spend time with his or her child and contribute to the child's upbringing. However, the most important issue, which parents at war with each other frequently forget, is that a child's fundamental right is to maintain regular contact with both parents. That right should be guaranteed by the legal systems operating throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>It is in recognition of the child's fundamental right that this regulation, in its draft form, is of importance. We should not diminish the rights and entitlements of parents. However, often parents in the exercise of their rights seek in the midst of family conflict to deprive their child of contact with the other parent. This reinforces the view that the primary person whose welfare should be considered in the exercise of access and contact rights is the child.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the content of this draft provision. While I welcome the Minister's approach in principle and the fact that we are opting in, what is being presented is grossly defective. There is a need for fundamental revision of the draft regulation. It is most unfortunate that, despite being in a new millennium, a regulation from the European Union dealing with issues of access or contact should seek to put in place a discrimination between children of a marriage and children outside a marriage. One third of the children born in this State are born outside marriage. Our courts regularly deal with disputes concerning the guardianship and custody of children born to parents outside marriage and the access or contact rights of parents with whom the child does not primarily reside. In the majority of instances the child is in the custody of a mother and the father seeks access or contact rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are regulations and provisions in force across the European Union which provide for co-operation between member states in the enforcement of maintenance support orders requiring both married and unmarried parents to provide maintenance support for their children. It is introducing an unfortunate discrimination to the new co-operative justice regime under the aegis of the European Union that this directive only seeks to guarantee to children their right to have contact with a married parent as opposed to an unmarried parent. If the focus is as it should be, that is, on the fundamental right of children to maintain contact with both their parents, we must refocus on something which this House acknowledged in 1987 with the enactment of the Status of Children Act. Discriminations in the context of a child's right to be involved with each of his parents should not be brought into law to distinguish <Col N="1331" /> between a child born to married parents and a child born to unmarried parents. No child currently having access to an unmarried parent had any say in the circumstances which gave rise to his or her conception.</P>
    <P>While it is welcome that France has proposed this regulation, I urge the Minister to seek to have it amended so that it is not confined in its scope to children of a marriage but extends to all children. I hope the Minister will try to achieve that end in the negotiations. I look forward to his response on that issue when he replies to this debate.</P>
    <P>Wearing my other hat of an occasionally practising lawyer in the area of family law, there is one issue of major concern to both married and unmarried parents when their relationships have broken down, they are leading separate lives and one parent has custody of a young child and the other has contact rights where one parent resides in one state and the custodial parent resides in another state. It is the major worry of the custodial parent that if access is exercised outside this State and if the non-custodial parent does not return the child to the custodial parent at the end of the agreed or court ordered access period, substantial difficulty may be experienced in having the child returned to this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg and Hague conventions address these issues and there are other provisions in place that are relevant. The reality in relation to the child abduction conventions is that some member states are more efficient in regarding child abduction as an issue that requires urgent judicial decision than others. Some states are extremely slow where a child has been retained wrongfully to have the case which comes before the state's courts heard, dealt with and resolved. There have been occasions when, due to the pressures courts have been under, they have not always dealt with such cases as speedily as they should. This is a matter about which our Supreme Court has been critical.</P>
    <P>In the context of the negotiation of this regulation, the Minister should ensure proper arrangements are in place that genuinely implement Chapter V in its current draft form and which guarantee and ensure, in the context of access being exercised to any child outside this State whose custodial parent resides in this State, that at the end of the access period, should the non-custodial parent not comply with the arrangements in force there is an immediate and prompt return to this jurisdiction of the child who has been retained wrongfully.</P>
    <P>The Minister should name the states with which there have been difficulties in getting speedy compliance with provisions under the Hague and Luxembourg conventions. It is my understanding that there are difficulties with some states. There should be a European-wide, efficient system that guarantees children access to parents where they are living in separate states and ensures a prompt return of a child to the cus<Col N="1332" /> todial parent. It is essential that states who have not promptly complied with their existing obligations are required to do so and that this provision, when it comes into force, is not tainted by their failure to comply with the provisions and intent of Chapter V.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the timeframe in which it is envisaged member states may agree on the final version of this new provision and when does he anticipate it will come into force? To come into force, will it require agreement on behalf of all EU member states or will it come into force partially on each member state becoming a signatory to the final terms of what is stated? Will the final version of what is agreed be brought before this House for its approval before the State is bound by its provisions? All these issues are matters of considerable importance because this issue will affect many families in the State, particularly those whose marriages have broken down. There is an onus on the Minister to ensure this regulation applies to all children and facilitates all children in having proper access to parents who live outside the State. This should not be confined solely to children born to parents who are married to each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's decision to opt in at this stage rather than wait until later. However, he might outline the benefits of opting in and in what way can Ireland influence the final form of the regulation. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the mechanisms for amending the draft currently before EU member states.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect is that the child's welfare must be paramount in the implementation of any court judgments in whatever country the decisions are made. It is important to stress this aspect because parents who are splitting up frequently focus on their own experience of the relationship breakdown and often do not put the child's welfare first. The child's welfare must be guaranteed when enacting and implementing the legislation. This becomes much more fraught with difficulty for the child concerned where the parents live in different states. It is difficult enough for a child who is with the mother during the week and the father at week-ends where the parents live in the same state. However, this is much more complicated where parents live in different states. Clearly the type of arrangement which is the norm where parents live close to each other cannot be the norm where parents live hundreds of miles apart or in a different country, which necessitates the child flying from one parent to another. This is a difficult issue and the interests of the child must be of paramount importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Deputy Shatter said in relation to the regulation not being confined to children born within marriage. The regulation should be extended to all children regardless of whether their parents have been married to each other. If this cannot be the case under the current provision, will the Minister clarify how the regulation <Col N="1333" /> can be extended to include children who are not born within marriage? Why does the regulation apply to children under the age of 16 and not include 17 year olds?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated there are concerns in relation to the provision that a declaration of enforceability will not be necessary in the requested state and the exact circumstances in which enforcement of an order can be suspended. It is indicated that it can be suspended in limited circumstances if enforcement would put the child's interests at serious risk. Obviously we would all support that but it is not clearly spelled out and I would like more clarity in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would also like clarity on which jurisdiction enforces the rights conferred in the regulation because different jurisdictions may have different priorities. For example, in Ireland a decision of a court may be accepted as the norm given our culture in relation to these matters, but it may be different in other countries. I recall a case where the mother of the child was Irish and the father was from another European country. The courts in that country considered it was better for the child to be in an institution in that country rather than with the mother in Ireland because, by being in the institution in that country, the child was nearer to the extended family of the father. Obviously I do not expect the Minister to comment on this case but I cite it because it indicates there are different norms and values in different countries.</P>
    <P>We would not like a decision made in a court of another EU country which we would consider not to be in the best interests of the child. I realise these matters are difficult because one is dealing with different jurisdictions. We are trying to be fair to all jurisdictions and produce a regulation which will be acceptable to all EU member states. Nevertheless, the issue of the child's interests being paramount and not being put at serious risk must be teased out so that we do not give away rights that are not consistent with what we consider to be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Hague Convention on Children. I assume these two regulations are designed to be complementary and not to conflict with each other. Will the Minister comment on that aspect? Overall this is a desirable regulation which should be supported. However, I have some concerns, particularly in relation to our laws being subsumed by and subservient to laws made in other countries. I hope when the draft is finalised the Minister will ensure these issues are raised and that we are not giving away rights which would mean that children could not be protected in the manner we would wish. I welcome the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper that Ireland should adopt this regulation. Will the Minister explain how this motion lies with article 20 of the regulation? It states: &ldquo;The United Kingdom and Ireland in accordance with Article 3 are not participating in the adoption of the regulation.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1334" /> Minister tried to explain that in his contribution but I am not sure I fully understood.</P>
      <P>In the area of child abduction and access to children, Mary Banotti MEP, a relation of mine, has established a fine record of participation in assisting parents who have suffered as a result of the abduction of their children. She is the European Parliament's special envoy in this matter and she has travelled far and wide trying to get many other countries to recognise their responsibilities under the Hague Convention.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate which other European countries have decided to adopt this regulation before 13 October? For example, has Denmark or the UK opted in? Many abductions and much of the movement of children to other jurisdictions are linked to the common travel area between Ireland and the UK. If the UK is not involved when this regulation is eventually agreed how will Ireland be able to enforce any custodial jurisdiction for Irish parents?</P>
      <P> I recently read a book entitled <i>They Are My Children, Too: A Mother's Struggle for Her Sons</i>, which outlined the appalling case of a French woman married to a German man who tried to gain custody of her sons. She has spoken publicly about her case. She is the wife of the British ambassador and lives in Washington. She obtained a custodial order in the UK but it was not recognised and could not be implemented in Germany. Article 13 states the interests of the parents with custody must be safeguarded and the authorities of the member state where the child is staying may not take jurisdiction during the child's stay to amend the foreign judgment which is being enforced. They should have circumscribed powers to order the child's return.</P>
      <P>It is clear, as Deputy Shatter said, that some of our EU colleagues do not properly fulfil the terms of the conventions that are in place. It is important when the Minister is discussing this issue with his European counterparts that he makes it clear that Ireland, in adopting this, will expect co-operation for the implementation of this new regulation across the board in order that parents are not left in a position where they have custody in one European country which is not recognised in another.</P>
      <P>I also share the concern that the regulation only refers to marital children. Consider an example of a man and woman who have had a child and lived together but are not married and one of them absconds with the child to another European jurisdiction. They are not married, yet the child was the product of a union similar to a couple living together as husband and wife. What is the position in such a case? The word &ldquo;marital&rdquo; needs to be properly defined. There are also difficulties with children of annulled marriages in Ireland. In the eyes of the church the couple are no longer married but in the eyes of the State they are still married. What is the position if the child of such a union is taken away and the custodial parent cannot get the child back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that it will be possible <Col N="1335" /> to enforce the laws of one country in another given that there has not been great progress in the area of <i>corpus juris</i> and the recognition of the laws of other countries? There is a great deal of discussion about it and the Minister and I will share a platform tomorrow at the presentation of a report by the Institute of European Affairs about freedom, justice and security. Is the Minister satisfied that when the negotiations on this have been completed progress will have been made?</P>
    <P> In terms of access to children, will the Minister consider the issue of grandparents, relatives and the wider family who also suffer terribly when the child is taken away from the custodial parent when he is discussing this matter at European level?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate. I support the decision to ratify the convention. It is important that children should be central to all decision making in this area. Unfortunately, too often the parents' agenda and their concerns are taken into account in these matters. A child has a civil right to know and be influenced by both parents, except in special circumstances such as violence and so on. Examination of this area and all policy in this area should be child-centred. Unfortunately, it is parent-centred in most cases.</P>
      <P>I believe children have a right to know and be influenced by both parents and to know the parents' extended families. That is a fundamental right for any child, regardless of marital circumstances or conflict between parents. We have an adversarial system, which is not child-centred, in terms of deciding the outcome of marriage breakdowns and the custody arrangements for children. The relationship between the parents is made much worse by the approach inherent in the system, which is not child-centred.</P>
      <P>When the Hague Convention was debated in the House we raised the difficulty of enforcing it across Europe because of the lack of experience of judges who decided on such matters in other countries. Under our legal system the judges who make decisions have vast experience of dealing with various cases. In Europe, the magistrates and judges have little experience and do not have the same background. This has caused problems in dealing with cases of access to children. There is a difficulty in terms of consistency between and within different countries in deciding these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All children should be included under the convention, regardless of whether they are married. All children have a right to be included and to be considered under it. While the Minister can influence it, he cannot make a decision because it is decided at European level. However, in terms of dealing with family issues, every child has two parents and a child has a right to access in all circumstances. This facilitates a certain amount of access by both parents where there has been an <Col N="1336" /> abduction. However, 30% of the children born today will be excluded. This is a serious defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised legislation but under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Ireland has obligated itself to having an ombudsman for children. Legislation has been promised but this office has not been established. When will the State appear again before a UN conference, similar to the one held a few years ago in Geneva, at which we will have to account for ourselves? I hope that, at that stage, Ireland will have an ombudsman for children to ensure their rights are protected, they are listened to and are at the centre of all legislation which affects them. At present, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Parents and adults decide what is right for children without ever consulting them. Children have no means of expressing their concerns, difficulties or views. I listened to a radio programme three days ago on which children were interviewed. They expressed very serious and deep views about what is happening in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate. It is important Ireland exercises the option provided by the protocol within the three month period which is stipulated so that the State can play a full and constructive part in the development and finalisation of the instrument.</P>
      <P>The instrument is designed to facilitate rights of access to children by their parents, to give greater clarity to the law in member states of the European Union and to have tangible benefits in terms of the time and expense involved in access proceedings in the civil area. The expectation is that generally the new procedures for co-operation should result in a more efficient and effective functioning of judicial proceedings in such cases within the EU.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter about the primacy of the child's right to maintain contact with both parents in the aftermath of divorce, annulment, separation or marital breakdown. Animosity between the parties can be inimical in that regard. I also agree with Deputy Neville's argument that access to the extended family is of considerable importance. The draft regulation seeks to deal with this situation. It is a regulation rather than a convention so it will come into force on a given date which will be inserted in Article 18.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Owen's point about recital 20, the position will change when Ireland opts in. As it stands, it states that Ireland and the UK are outside it. I cannot speak for the United Kingdom about what precisely it will do. The recital states that the United Kingdom and Ireland in accordance with Article 3 of the protocol, the Treaty on European Union and the treaty establishing the European Community are not participating in the option as regulated and are, therefore, not bound by it. However, they are subject to its application. This will change when Ireland opts in.</P>

      <P>Another issue raised by Deputies was the exclusion of children other than the joint marital children of the parents from the scope of the regulation. The scope of this regulation mirrors the scope of the Brussels II regulation which deals with jurisdiction and the recognition of enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and on matters of parental responsibility for joint children.</P>
      <P>The decision to restrict the scope of these regulations to judgments concerning the children of both spouses will not, however, prevent the future extension of jurisdiction or criteria. The French Presidency has indicated the need to extend the scope of existing instruments to address the legal needs of non-marital children and their parents as part of a wider programme of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters.</P>
      <P>Deputies spoke about the provisions relating to the interests of the child. As I stated, this regulation is an extension of Brussels II and will only relate to access orders made in the context of Brussels II. In article 4 of this instrument, one of the grounds for suspending the enforcement of an access order is where such enforcement would pose a serious direct risk to the child's physical or psychological health. Where this is not the case, the order will not be suspended, but its enforceability can be challenged by, for example, the custodial parents or parent on the grounds set out in the Brussels II regulation. Obviously, if the application is successful, the order will no longer be enforceable in the requested country.</P>
      <P>One of the grounds on which recognition of enforcement of an order can be challenged under Brussels II is if this is manifestly contrary to public policy, taking account of the interests of the child. However, as I said earlier, some concern has been expressed about the circumstances under which enforcement of an order will be suspended under article 4. This concern focuses on whether the article gives appropriate protection to the interests of the child. I assure the Deputies that our approach to the negotiations on this issue will be informed by the overriding concern that proper account must be taken of the best interests of the child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to extend the role of the National Treasury Management Agency to provide for the establishment of a State claims agency, a central treasury service and a fund investment service. The aim of these new services is to make savings and maximise income for the Exchequer. I intend to set out what each of the services involves and how they will operate in practice later. First, I wish to outline why I propose to establish them under the auspices of the NTMA.</P>
      <P>The NTMA was established in 1990 with flexible management structures and suitably qualified personnel to borrow money for the Exchequer and to manage the national debt at a time when debt management had become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity. The NTMA has proved very successful in managing the national debt. The agency model of debt management has subsequently been adopted by a number of other countries. In the performance of its debt management role, the agency has built up a broad range of financial management skills. It is because of these skills that I asked the agency to take on the role of agent of the commissioners of the national pensions reserve fund, which is also being debated at present in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long been of the view that the current arrangements for handling claims against the State are unsatisfactory and that a new approach is needed to put in place a structured and coherent response to meet these claims. The choice is between establishing a new agency to handle claims or to give the task to an existing one. As with the national pensions reserve fund, it is my <Col N="1339" /> view that the NTMA possesses the skills which will enable it to perform this new function in an efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>The proposed central treasury and fund investment service will involve the utilisation of cash and risk management skills which the agency already possesses. These services offer potential savings to the Exchequer. It makes sense to avail of the NTMA's expertise in these areas and to provide for the addition of these facilities to the services already provided by the agency.</P>
    <P>I wish to give the House some background on the State claims agency. The upsurge in army deafness claims which took place towards the end of 1995 caused increased attention to be directed at the general question of compensation claims against the State, their cost and how they should be managed. It was argued that the management of claims against the State, centralised in a single agency dedicated to that purpose, would involve the adoption of a proactive approach in seeking least cost settlements in accordance with best practice of claims departments of insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The main benefits which were seen as arising from the operation of a claims agency were savings in settlement costs and legal charges to both claimants and the State resulting from more efficient handling of claims. The risk advice role which a claims agency would assume would also help to reduce the incidence of claims and thus the overall cost.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments looked favourably on the idea by first directing that draft legislation to establish a State claims agency should be brought forward and later that a claims agency under the NTMA should be considered further. However, the issues involved proved complex and required extensive consultation with Departments as well as the Office of the Attorney General. This was against the background that there is no general legislative provision for dealing with personal injury or property damage claims against the State onto which proposals for a claims agency could have been grafted.</P>
    <P>Extensive discussions also took place with the NTMA on the issues involved and, in particular, on how to deal with certain concerns which arose. Those concerns related to issues, such as the scope of the claims to be managed, the funding provisions which should apply and how to give Departments, the clients, an influence in the way the claims functions would be handled. This process took longer than any of us would have wished or expected. The actual drafting of the legislative provisions was also a lengthy process, reflecting that in this Bill we are breaking new ground. The provisions of the Bill meet the concerns mentioned above and I am happy to recommend them to the House.</P>
    <P>It is essential that Departments and other State authorities against whom claims are made have an influence on how claims are handled by the agency on their behalf. This will be achieved <Col N="1340" /> through their being directly consulted on the general guidelines to be laid down on how the NTMA carries out its claims management functions and through the policy committee on which the Departments will be represented. The policy and general procedures to be followed in handling claims will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It had been envisaged at an earlier stage that a State claims agency would deal with Army hearing loss cases. However, the strategy adopted by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has been successful in bringing about a dramatic reduction in the levels of compensation being paid in these cases. The Minister has established a pilot scheme specifically for the Army hearing loss claims and it is hoped most of them can be disposed of under that scheme, with considerable savings to the Exchequer. Accordingly, there may not be a role for the claims agency in handling such cases. However, this matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the new arrangements will lead to savings for the Exchequer. It is, however, virtually impossible to estimate the amount of savings which might be achieved. The potential can be gauged from the overall cost of claims. Latest estimates of the costs of the new claims arising, excluding Army hearing loss, amount to £8.5 million per year. The legal costs on this amount could be around £2.8 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the present arrangements for handling claims against the State as satisfactory. Society in Ireland is becoming more litigious. Further class actions, as in Army deafness, may occur in addition to the growing number of routine cases. I am strongly of the view that the State must have in place a structured and coherent response to these claims. A more businesslike approach to the settlement of genuine claims is also desirable in the interests of claimants and to secure lower costs in the long run. The provisions of this Bill will achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>I know the agency intends to adopt a commercial approach to claims management. It will not be a soft touch for inflated claims or those with little or no merit. I would like claimants, existing and prospective, and their advisers to be clear in that regard. If all concerned realise that, they are less likely to make or push claims which they know to be less than deserving.</P>
    <P>The agency will also be proactive in the vital area of risk management. The application of sound risk management principles and procedures should ensure that over time the frequency of accidents and injuries will decline. They cannot be totally eliminated. One of the tasks facing the agency will be to ensure Departments have procedures in place to deal quickly and positively with the victims of genuine accidents. Such an approach can often mean that incidents which might otherwise give rise to contentious claims and litigation can be quickly resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Central Treasury Service proposals will enable the NTMA to offer deposit, overdraft and <Col N="1341" /> loan facilities to health boards, vocational educational committees, local authorities and other designated non-commercial State bodies. The objective is to offer such bodies a competitive service in these areas with a view to achieving savings for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The proposals stem from concerns expressed by the NTMA that the interest paid on short-term surpluses and charged on overdraft facilities along with bank charges represented bad value compared to the NTMA's capacity to raise or place cash at wholesale money market rates. To achieve savings for the Exchequer, the agency suggested that it might offer central treasury services to the non-commercial State sector. These services were aimed at complementing, rather than replacing, existing banking arrangements for the organisations involved.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group, which was representative of the NTMA and the various Departments concerned, examined these proposals. The group concluded that the interest rates offered and charged by the banks were generally less competitive than rates which the NTMA could offer. However, the group also noted that some organisations have negotiated discounted bank charges as a part of packages requiring them to maintain some minimum level of cash balances and-or overdraft facilities with their banks.</P>
    <P>The practice of maintaining certain levels of cash balances or borrowings in return for low transaction processing fees is not necessarily the most cost effective option. Best practice would dictate that the cost of each service should be evaluated separately, with the objective of availing of the most competitively priced combination of services. I envisage a situation where the NTMA provides the bodies with keenly priced deposit and loan facilities and where the banks provide the transaction processing services. The Bill will bring greater competition and transparency in the provision of theses services which can be of benefit only to the bodies concerned. It will be the responsibility of each individual body to ensure it purchases its package of services in the most cost-effective manner.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group recommended that the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, should be amended to enable the NTMA to offer central treasury services to non-commercial State bodies and this recommendation was accepted by the Government. The necessary provisions to give effect to this recommendation are contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, last week I introduced legislation in the House which will make the NTMA manager of the new National Pensions Reserve Fund. In this role the agency will act on behalf of the independent commissioners who will control, manage and invest the fund. The proposed role for the agency under the current Bill is different. The Bill deals with funds, such as the Social Insurance Fund, which are managed by Ministers and where the Minister concerned has a statutory responsibility to invest the fund assets. <Col N="1342" /> The Bill will enable the agency to perform this investment function on behalf of the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>Under the NTMA Act, 1990, the functions of the agency are to borrow money for the Exchequer and to manage the national debt. It does not have the statutory authority to manage and invest funds on behalf of the State. This is currently causing difficulties. These difficulties can be illustrated if I describe the situation which has arisen with the Social Insurance Fund. This fund holds the proceeds of employer and employee social insurance contributions and is used to pay social insurance benefits. In previous years the fund's income was not sufficient to cover the costs of these benefits and had to be subvented by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Due to the increase in employment and wages and the decrease in social insurance payments in recent years, there is currently a surplus in the Social Insurance Fund. This surplus is projected to reach £630 million by the end of the year. As the responsible Minister, I am required to invest this surplus in certain authorised products. These include long-term bonds, short-term securities and cash accounts. However, the risk and investment management systems and skills to effectively manage such a large sum available to me are in the NTMA. The issue is being resolved in the short-term with the assistance of the NTMA through investment in NTMA Exchequer notes. This addresses the risk issue through utilisation of the agency's management systems. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long-term, particularly as the volume of moneys involved increases. Additionally, it does not maximise the return on fund investments as it does not enable investment in higher yielding assets, such as long-term bonds. The most sensible solution to this issue is to enable the NTMA to invest the fund directly utilising the full range of authorised investment instruments on my behalf.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses the anomaly whereby the Government's professional investment expertise which is concentrated in the NTMA cannot be utilised in the investment of Government funds. It enables the NTMA to formally provide a fund investment service where required. It will remain a matter for the Minister in each case to decide whether to avail of the service.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years, the NTMA has been involved in consultancy projects in central and eastern Europe, South America and Asia. In all cases work has been carried out for the ministries of finance in the respective countries. Apart from the revenues generated, consultancy work has brought additional benefits to the agency in the form of broadening the skill base of its employees. However, the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, does not formally include a provision to provide consultancy services to parties other than the Government. The Bill formally empowers the agency to undertake such assignments.</P>
    <P>I will now outline for the House some of the <Col N="1343" /> key provisions of the Bill. Part 2 contains the provisions in relation to the State Claims Agency. In general, the NTMA will be empowered to manage personal injury and property damage compensation claims against the State, Departments, Ministers and the Attorney General, community and comprehensive schools and residential centres for young offenders. Claims against other bodies can be assigned to the agency in the future if it is appropriate and cost effective to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the functions that are to be performed by the agency in relation to the management of claims and counterclaims. The agency will manage claims and counterclaims so as to ensure that the State's liability and associated legal and other expenses are contained at the lowest achievable level. The section also requires the agency to provide risk management advisory services. Where it considers it appropriate to do so, the agency may purchase insurance cover against certain insurable risks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the delegation by Government order of the management of claims or classes of claims to the agency, at the request of Ministers. The section also contains a provision which would allow the Minister for Finance to direct the agency not to begin or to discontinue managing a claim. Such a direction would be made at the request of individual Ministers where the interests of the State so require.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the Attorney General's functions in relation to the management of claims by the agency in so far as his role as legal adviser to the Government is concerned. The agency will perform those functions on his behalf subject to the right of the Attorney General to receive such information as he requests from the agency and to give directions to the agency where the interests of the State so require. Such directions may include one directing the agency not to begin, or to discontinue, managing a claim. A direction to that effect, however, will lapse after 30 days unless a direction from the Minister for Finance is given or a delegation order is revoked by that date. The Attorney General may also give general guidelines to the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the establishment by the Minister of a policy committee which will advise the agency on policy and procedures relating to its claims management and risk management functions. Section 15 provides that the Minister for Finance may issue directions and guidelines to the agency in relation to the performance of its claims management functions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 sets out the arrangements which will apply in relation to the payment of settlement amounts or awards due to claimants and to the payment of fees to professional and other experts. The agency will make such payments out of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and will subsequently recoup the amounts involved from the Departments and offices. The Post Office Savings Bank Fund is an extra budgetary account of the Minister for Finance. The account is used primar<Col N="1344" /> ily to hold and invest the deposits received from the Post Office Savings Bank, but it is also used as an intermediary through which the NTMA conducts certain debt management activities with the markets. It provides a ready-made vehicle for the funding of settlements and the payment of fees.</P>
    <P>Part 3 contains the provisions in relation to the Central Treasury Service. Central treasury services are defined as the taking of deposits from and the making of advances to local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and other non-commercial State bodies. These other bodies may be prescribed by order.</P>
    <P>Section 20 authorises the Minister for Finance to provide central treasury services to non-commercial State bodies and also provides that such bodies may choose to avail of the service at their own discretion. Section 23 enables the Minister to delegate the operation of the central treasury service to the NTMA, while section 25 provides that the Minister may issue directions or guidelines to the NTMA in relation to its performance of the function.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the central treasury service will operate on the Post Office Savings Bank Fund. As with the settling of claims by the State Claims Agency, the fund provides a ready made vehicle through which central treasury services can be provided.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that vocational education committees may place funds with more than one financial institution and also utilise the central treasury service. At present, vocational education committees are precluded from banking with more than one bank which prevents them from seeking the best value available on surpluses which may arise on their accounts from time to time.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the fund investment service are set out in Part 4 of the Bill. Funds invested by the Minister for Finance and funds invested by other Ministers are dealt with separately. Section 28 provides that funds invested by the Minister for Finance may be delegated to the agency by ministerial order. Section 29 provides that the NTMA may act as an agent of another Minister in the performance of his or her investment functions under terms and conditions agreed between that Minister and the agency.</P>
    <P>The NTMA was established in 1990 as an innovative solution to a particular problem which existed at that time. In the performance of its primary task of debt management, the agency has developed a number of competencies and skills which can be usefully employed to the Exchequer's advantage in other areas. This Bill allows the NTMA to build on the strengths it already possesses as a debt management agency and to use its expertise to provide further financial and risk management services to the State. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been in gestation for a considerable length of time. I remember having <Col N="1345" /> lengthy discussions with the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, about the establishment of a State claims agency almost four years ago. I am not blaming the Minister for the delays that occurred because I realise that the issues are quite complex. The Minister has brought forward one set of solutions and we can tease out the implications of these solutions on Committee Stage. I have no difficulty with the principle of the Bill and I will agree Second Stage on that basis. There are a number of issues which will arise on Committee Stage, however, and we will get around to those in due course.</P>
      <P>The NTMA has been a particularly successful State agency. It was set up by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in 1990 for a particular reason. Difficulties arose at the time with the retention of staff. Control, servicing, rescheduling and repayment of the debt were primary economic issues at the time. They have faded into the background in recent years for a number of reasons but it is worth using this opportunity to note the success of the NTMA and to thank its staff, the people seconded from the Department of Finance and the wider circle of civil servants in the Department of Finance who contributed to the control of the debt in the past. Suffice to say that the NTMA has been successful.</P>
      <P>The problem with the national debt does not loom highly in our debates now. While the rising tide lifting all boats has lifted the burden of the debt off our backs also, the management by the NTMA of the debt was a significant contributor to the changed circumstances in which we find ourselves. It has left us with an agency staffed with expert people whose skills, in effect, are now underused because the burden of the debt is not as great and having joined the euro, much of what was deemed previously to be foreign debt is now domestic debt. The actual non-euro debt must now be a very small proportion of the national debt, probably about 10%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or less. We can see why the role of the NTMA, in rescheduling the debt, avoiding exchange rate risk and so on, has diminished. It is appropriate, therefore, that the Minister should try to hold this agency intact and to seek new functions for it to perform. One of those which was proposed last week and on which the debate will continue tomorrow afternoon is the NTMA's new role in managing the pension fund. I have fairly strong views on that which I will express tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NTMA is a good place also to vest the new responsibilities of a State Claims Agency. There have been quite a lot of claims against the State. I do not know the most recent figure but there must be between 3,000 and 4,000 claims against the State at any one time at different levels of process, and the amount of money involved is quite large. I <Col N="1346" /> was interested in the Minister's figure that in the most recent year, excluding Army hearing loss claims, we are talking in terms of £8.5 million a year and legal costs amounting to £2.8 million. That makes the point strongly about what the Minister is trying to do.</P>
    <P>Those who settle with the new State claims agency will not be short-changed in damages. The only gain to the State will be from the efficiency of the management of the claims, the early settlement of many claims to the benefit of victims and State and the reduction in the legal costs. Legal costs of £2.8 million on a settlement of £8.5 million represent 30% of the settlement, which is extravagant. There is no need for it. It gives rise to a number of other issues.</P>
    <P>I agree in general with the idea of a State claims agency and that the NTMA, because it has financial expertise and does not now have as much work or as great a responsibility as it exercised previously, is an appropriate place to locate the State claims agency. It is not clear from the Minister's speech how this will work in practice. The NTMA's expertise is in the financial area. The expertise required in settling claims, in the first instance, is legal. While the NTMA can assess the cost of whether to settle, can make actuarial estimates of whether it is better to settle today or in two years time and can assess whether it is better to settle out of court or to take the case to court, the primary function in a settlement agency is legal, that of experienced barristers, used to dealing with personal injury claims, knowing by the case stated about how much it would be worth. The NTMA does not have that expertise. Is it the Minister's intention to mandate the NTMA to establish an experienced legal department and take in experienced barristers and solicitors, given that much of the work envisaged will be carried out by barristers and solicitors? The Minister is silent on his intent in this regard.</P>
    <P>That immediately gives rise to questions about the Chief State Solicitor's Office. Much of the legal work, which will be transferred to the NTMA, is currently carried out in the Chief State Solicitor's Office. Is it intended that a large number of legal personnel currently employed in the Chief State Solicitor's office will be transferred to the NTMA and from the legal department of the NTMA, or does the Minister envisage that parallel legal expertise will operate in the NTMA and will be reinforced or second-guessed by the staff of the Chief State Solicitor's Office?</P>
    <P>The easy solution, as presented, seems to be to allow the staff of the Chief State Solicitor's Office to continue with the legal work and to keep the financial work in the NTMA, but I do not think that will work. The calculation of risk and advice on whether to settle will have to be given jointly by people with legal experience and financial expertise. The Bill cannot achieve its objective if it provides for pure assessment on a financial basis only and the legal position is not taken into account. The Minister must clarify that position.</P>
    <P>To surmount other difficulties, a section of the <Col N="1347" /> Bill establishes a role for the Attorney General. It seems the Attorney General will make the final decision on settlement in cases where there is a doubt as to whether to settle. The chain of command is such that a process is not clear. How will the system operate in practice? If a person fell down a staircase in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and made a claim, that person's solicitor would write to the Department, that case would be passed to the Chief State Solicitor's Office and then to the NTMA, and then there would be negotiations on whether to settle. How does the chain of command operate in dealing with such a case? The NTMA would take the first step in that it assesses the risk. Would the case then be passed to the Chief State Solicitor's Office or would it be passed to that office first and then passed to the NTMA? Could the NTMA sign off on such a settlement or would that be done by the Attorney General? The manner in which that process will operate is not clear.</P>
    <P>The Minster made it clear that parent Departments will continue to have a role in deciding whether settlements should be made. I can see where he is coming from, as there are occasions when issues other than money would arise. If a State claims agency, such as that proposed, were to settle a matter with an admission of liability, that admission would not be only an admission of liability that the State or a Department was at fault, it would be an admission, in many cases, that identifiable individuals in a Department were at fault. A difficulty arises between the desire to settle for financial reasons and the desire of people in the parent Department not to admit liability because they do not want to admit they were at fault if they believe they were not, even though a settlement is being made.</P>
    <P>A major problem arises in this regard in terms of how the hierarchy operates. Who would sign off on such a settlement? Would the State claims agency have the plenipotentiary power to settle, would it have to refer all settlements to the Attorney General to sign off on them or would it have to refer all settlements, in the first instance, to the parent Department or agency to sign off on them and then to the Attorney General to sign off on them? This may sound academic but it is not so if a claim is made where an admission of liability involves a named civil servant and a State claims agency admits on its behalf or on behalf of the State that a named individual is liable for error or wrongdoing in respect of which a claim is to be paid.</P>
    <P>Class action cases caused many of us in the previous Government to think along these lines. The series of Army deafness claims is the one that springs to everyone's mind. At the start and in the middle of that process it seemed there was a better way to proceed. A better way of dealing with them was found in terms of the manner in which that process proceeded during the past 18 months. If the State were faced with a similar situation, we hope that the State claims agency <Col N="1348" /> would arrive at the class action settlement at a point far in advance of what happened previously.</P>
    <P>We know that the State will most likely face a series of claims on behalf of adults who were abused while they were in the care of the State as children. This is an obvious area where the State will face a large class action. That will probably be the first test of how the State claims agency will work. As this is an area of great sensitivity it would be prudent for the Minister to have worked out the answers to the questions I posed. He may have worked them out already but, if so, he did not allude to them in his speech. We may be able to further tease them out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A litigant at all times will have the right to pursue his or her case to the High Court. There cannot be any suggestion that the State claims agency can take away the right of a citizen to sue in court and seek a settlement. If the State claims agency employs a group of barristers and solicitors, there is a danger if they are retained as permanent staff that over time they will lose contact with the world of the courts and with the rates in the High Court for injuries. When dealing with the issue of staffing, the NTMA, acting as a State claims agency with a legal department assisting it, could, in a short period of time, lose contact with what is happening outside. Many claims would not be settled and would still proceed to court and, in effect, an intermediate barrier would have been introduced which people would have to climb before facing the long delays before being able to settle in the High Court.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a number of unanswered questions as to how this will work in practice. In theory and in principle it has my full support. I appreciate why it has been so long in gestation. I know the questions I am putting and others I will put on Committee Stage have occupied the thoughts of those who drafted the Bill. Those questions are not fully answered in this legislation and I would like to hear the Minister's views when he replies to this debate and before we proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill's other proposals, such as a central treasury service which will enable the NTMA to offer deposit, overdraft and loan facilities to health boards, vocational education committees, local authorities and other designated non-commercial State bodies, do not cause me much concern. That seems reasonable and fills a gap in the market. There are various times when local authorities and health boards have surplus funds in their balances and I have had personal experience of county managers informing councils that they were putting big sums of money at overnight deposit rates with no particular expertise behind it. That is not the best way to operate with the kinds of balances that obtain in these bodies. Some were very successful, while others were not. Some people did not try to get the best return for the local authority at all; they took the prudent course and brought the money to the local Bank of Ireland or AIB, frequently leaving it in a cur<Col N="1349" /> rent account. Sums of millions of pounds were left for short periods of time in current accounts when they could have been earning money for the local authority or health board concerned. I do not blame anyone for this. County managers and chief executive officers of health boards are managers and not financial experts or investment managers. They would not have staff with the skills of an investment manager. It is timely that the NTMA will take on this role and I approve of this excellent proposal fully. I know they will do the job very well.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to expand his comments on the fund investment service and the social insurance fund. The social insurance fund was, in my experience, more a concept than an actual fund for many years. It was in deficit for so long that the State was simply topping it up. There was never any question of the money in the fund being invested at a rate of return because there was no money in the fund; it was always in deficit. Over the last few years it has slowly crept into surplus and I am surprised at the level of surplus declared today by the Minister &ndash; £630 million in the social insurance fund is a fairly significant surplus at a time when those who benefit from the fund are not showered with generosity by the State. I understand from what the Minister said that he has certain responsibilities for investing this money which derive, I presume, from the Act which instituted it in the first instance. Although, as I said, this did not arise while the fund was in deficit, now that it is in surplus it is prudent that the NTMA acts and invests the funds for the best return possible.</P>
    <P>However, this gives rise to the question that I posed when we were introducing the pensions fund Bill last week &ndash; if the expectation is that the social insurance fund remains in surplus and that fund is used for contributory pensions, among other things, why does the Minister feel there should be a separate mandate for the NTMA to manage the contributions that are dedicated for the purpose of pensions, while in another part of the same organisation there is a section which is managing the 1% of GNP which is being put in to fund any shortfalls there might be after 2025 in the payment of pensions to PRSI, social insurance or State pension beneficiaries?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if the NTMA is to manage a pension fund, the first contribution should be the contributions made by civil servants to their own pensions and the contributions made by those who pay PRSI to the social insurance fund. I cannot see why the Minister is setting up a variety of investment funds related to the provision of pensions.</P>
    <P>While I agree with giving the NTMA the additional role of a fund investment service in respect of funds in the social insurance fund, I cannot see why that particular part of this Bill could not have been incorporated into the other Bill. That would seem a more logical fit, because now we will have a situation where the NTMA is managing the debt while acting as a claims <Col N="1350" /> agency. It will be investing surplus funds from local authorities and so on and will also be acting as the manager of the new pension fund initiated by the Minister. The funds already available are about £5 billion, which will be topped up by a sum of over £600 million a year and rising as GNP rises. On top of that, the Minister said today that the NTMA will be given the role of managing surplus funds in the social insurance fund, which, among other things, is used for social insurance benefits. It is also used extensively for pensions.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the surplus fund &ndash; as long as it is in surplus &ndash; cannot be put into the primary pension fund. I do not understand why we should continue on a pay as you go system for the pensions of civil servants, teachers, gardaí and so on in circumstances where contributions are being made. There does not seem to be a fund and yet we are setting up the fund but the contributions are not going into that fund. There is illogicality here that needs to be explained either in the context of this Bill or the pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>That said, I do not have a problem in principle with the Bill, but there are difficulties which I hope to tease out on Committee Stage. I wish the NTMA well in the provision of consultancy services. There is no problem with giving them a statutory mandate to provide these services in the fourth section of the Bill. I will agree to the Second Stage, but there are issues to which I will return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan said, this Bill has been a long time coming. I know it was first conceived by my former party leader and the then Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, four or five years ago and I know the Minister has been supportive of the idea since he took office. We also know that the Bill has caused a certain amount of institutional tension between the Departments involved, which is par for the course in cases like this. I welcome the Bill and I am glad it has been introduced.</P>
      <P>The idea behind it is very straightforward. Our society is becoming a good deal more litigious than it would have been 20 years ago. More and more claims are being taken and the State is appearing more and more often as a defendant in cases taken by ordinary citizens. As matters stand, the treatment of cases taken against the State is haphazard, to say the least, and is not as controlled as it might be. We have all heard about cases which one might have considered hopeless but which have been fought to the door of the courts and sometimes through the courts at a considerably increased cost to the Exchequer than might otherwise have been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a reluctance on the part of the State to accept liability and, to some extent, that is understandable. There is a reluctance to set precedent which might prove to be costly in future. However, a failure of bureaucracy is also evident in this. Our system is not well adapted to the notion of accepting fault. Civil and public servants who are perfectly good decision makers <Col N="1351" /> in just about any other area will sometimes baulk at the notion of accepting that they or the system they operate is at fault or that one of their colleagues has been at fault in operating the system. It is not difficult to understand the group dynamic involved in that, but there is an additional element which also may be relevant.</P>
    <P>In the private sector claims managers often accept liability in cases which could easily have been fought through the courts. They settle cases for so-called nuisance value. In very simple terms, they will pay a few thousand pounds here or there just to make a case go away, whatever its merits might have been. They often settle a case for nuisance value simply to avoid the additional costs, including legal costs, which would be incurred by pursuing the case further. In an ideal world this should not happen.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world justice should be pure and should be seen to be done in the courts or, if possible, beforehand but in the world of commercial reality this practice happens all the time and we should acknowledge it. It may not be a great idea in principle to accept liability in cases where it is not established or where one believes that it cannot be established, but in practice it helps insurance companies or claims managers to manage claims and limit their costs and liabilities. In the State sector there is a greater reluctance to take such a hard-headed view and, as I said, it is easy to understand why this is so. However, the net effect is that the State ends up paying out more than it might otherwise have done, and that is something we must make every effort to stop.</P>
    <P>There is a view developing in this country that we have something of a claims culture and the statistics seem to bear this out. In particular, there is a view that the State, State authorities, local authorities or vocational education committees are an easy touch for a few quid. There are legion examples of people who set out essentially to rip off the State and there is hardly a member of the legal profession who could not regale one with stories of where that has happened in the most outrageous of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I remember as a young solicitor five or ten years ago coming across a case of an unfortunate woman in a northern suburb of Dublin whose two very young children had had the misfortune to have suffered broken limbs, a broken arm in one case and a broken leg in the other, within a fortnight of each other. She came to my office, asked for advice and explained that both children had been hurt in the same playground by falling over a bollard and off a swing. I told her that she might very well have a case against the local authority and we initiated a claim against it. I looked for a medical report from the casualty unit of Beaumont Hospital. The first sentence of it stated that the young lad attended at the accident and emergency department when he fell from his bike. In the second case I was told that the young girl had been a passenger on the crossbar of the bike. This appeared in the medical report and had not been <Col N="1352" /> disclosed to me by the woman who presented with her two injured children.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, it is very easy to dismiss those cases and to say that such people should not try to rip off the State or a local authority as it was in this case, and that would be the politically correct response to make. However, it is worth taking it a little further. It is worth considering whether in such circumstances there should not be an entitlement to compensation for children who are injured while on the property of a local authority, which is also the property of the State. Many people in society do not make the link between fault, negligence and compensation. They see the link as between genuine and sometimes serious injury and compensation. They expect to be compensated for the injury irrespective of whether someone else is at fault. The conventional legal view is that these people are wrong and deserve to lose in court and that we should not deal with them in the first place.</P>
    <P>However, there may be good reason to deal with them and there are jurisdictions which deal on a no fault basis in such cases, be they occupiers' liability or road traffic cases. New Zealand has been to the fore in operating a no fault system for many years in the latter area.</P>
    <P>People are genuinely injured, they have a grievance and they have certainly incurred costs. The blunt reality is that, if the State were to entertain some of these cases &ndash; I do not argue it should be done in all cases &ndash; such as in a school, for example, where a child is injured in the playground, it might prove cheaper for the State or VEC to deal with cases for compensation purely on the basis of the injury caused rather than seeking to establish or defend a case of negligence where the individual has to establish that there was not proper supervision or the teacher had taken a smoking break or something of that nature. We might find it cheaper and it might be fairer to deal with cases of that nature simply on the basis of the injury caused and on a no fault basis.</P>
    <P>Another interesting question is whether the State, as a defendant, owes the same or a greater duty of care to citizens or employees than perhaps do other authorities or employers. In law, the answer is that it does not and that is the end of the matter. However, in practice, our expectations and the citizens' expectations are different. For example, the State never disputed liability in the Stardust case, but it was widely felt to be right to compensate the victims in the way that was ultimately done through the tribunal. I remember speaking to the then Attorney General, John Rogers, and I know the efforts he made with the full support of Government and the House to devise a structure which would be fair and reasonable. In the end the State made <i>ex gratia</i> payments in cases where liability was, to say the least, by no means clear.</P>
    <P>To put it even more bluntly, the State could have dragged those unfortunate people one by one through the courts over a period and who <Col N="1353" /> knows what the outcome might have been. Instead, an essentially political decision was taken that justice required that these people be compensated. I know that that decision, when taken at the time, had not only support within this House but wide public support. I would go so far as to say that, had any other decision been taken, there would have been a great deal of public resistance and resentment.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C case is a case of something that very nearly went wrong. In the first instance, the State decided to defend the McCole case. I do not know what happened &ndash; Deputy Noonan probably has a better idea than I do but it is not difficult to guess. The lawyers told the politicians to admit nothing in case the floodgates opened. It was only after a measure of public outcry that the tactics changed and, ultimately, justice was done to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>What I am getting at is that the State is not the same as any other defendant. Citizens expect the State and its agents to exercise an additional level of care and discretion. There are cases which are exceptional but not unusual where the State accepts liability, and properly so, even if the case is defensible according to the normal rules. It is important that the new structure we are setting up under this legislation allows for this. The agency must operate according to normal commercial criteria most of the time, but there will also be occasions when a more political view will need to be taken and the structure must allow for that possibility. In particular, it is important the structure is not used as cover by those, be they public servants or politicians, who are reluctant to make the hard decision.</P>
    <P>The legislation sets up the National Treasury Management Agency as the claims agency. I have no problem with that for some of the reasons given by Deputy Noonan and the Minister. However, it is worth lingering on why the NTMA was chosen. On the face of it, it has no specific expertise to offer in dealing with legal cases or in claims management. It does not seem to be the obvious choice. I guess the reason lies not just in the fact that it has expertise which is not used as much as it was ten years ago but also in its structure. It is in the public sector but has a private sector ethos and is not of the public sector. It is not bound by public sector employment or pay structures. It is more flexible, has a higher turnover of staff and contracts work in and out at the discretion of management.</P>
    <P>It is not a secret that this unique status causes a certain measure of tension, not to mention resentment, on the part of the Department and the rest of the public service. We must learn from this experience. The State, in the form of the Civil Service and the public service in general, needs to be able to buy in expertise for a short period. Likewise, we need to be able to offer existing public servants greater flexibility. We must be able to allow these people to take a career break in order to work in the private sector for a short period. To borrow the management phrase, we <Col N="1354" /> must be more &ldquo;task oriented&rdquo; rather than adhering to our current generalist position.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Noonan, I am interested in discovering how the Minister sees the agency working. I had a useful briefing yesterday with the Minister's officials &ndash; I thank the Minister and his officials for allowing that to happen &ndash; and I asked how the agency would work and what practices it would adopt. To paraphrase the response I received, I understand this would be a matter for the agency which, effectively, is the ethos contained in the Bill. It is unlikely the Department would take such a hands-off approach if any project were suggested by just any other Department. It appears a unique status has been afforded to the NTMA, which is probably a good development. However, I wish to know how it will work in practice because I am not sure the Department can take such a hands-off approach.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson here in terms of how other jobs might be done. Perhaps we can explore the jobs to which I refer on another occasion. However, there is a lesson to be learned in terms of giving flexibility and granting the task to particular public servants who are not as constrained as others might be or have been in the past by the way in which things are done traditionally.</P>
    <P>The Bill is essentially permissive. It allows Ministers to refer claims, it allows the agency to accept them and it allows the Attorney General or a Minister to direct that the agency should discontinue dealing with a particular claim. I wish to know whether the Minister envisages that particular types of claims will be assigned <i>ab initio</i> to the agency. The Minister's intentions were made clear in respect of Army hearing impairment claims, but let us consider the example to which Deputy Noonan referred, namely, people who were placed in State schools in the past. Does the Minister intend that a decision would be taken to refer all of these cases to the State agency? Would the agency, in effect, be performing a role similar to that played by tribunals, such as the Stardust tribunal or the hepatitis C tribunal, in recent years in assessing damages and awarding damages to particular individuals, accepting, of course, that such individuals would always retain the right to appeal to the courts should they choose to do so?</P>
    <P>A difficulty still exists in the Bill with regard to accountability. The NTMA will be charged with performing quite a significant task on behalf of the Government. As I understand it, the responsibility of the director of the agency will continue to be, as it is under the main Act, to the Minister for Finance. I assume, therefore, that the Minister will be responsible to the Dáil for the activities of the State claims agency. I am not sure that is adequate. The practice has been that, in effect, the Minister does not answer to the House for the activities of the NTMA simply because they rarely tend to be at the top of the agenda. There is a case for obliging the agency, at the very least, to produce an annual report if not to present that report to a committee of the House, whether to <Col N="1355" /> the Committee of Public Accounts or the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, whichever seems more appropriate. However, there is a need for a mechanism to establish accountability. Such a mechanism does not exist currently.</P>
    <P>The Bill obliges the Minister to establish a policy committee. The role of that committee is not clear from the Bill. I assume it will be to deal with broad issues of policy and there is no question that it will deal with individual cases of any sort. However, it is still not clear which issues of policy the committee is likely to deal with and to whom the committee, in turn, is responsible. For example, will the Minister interact with the committee? It is also unclear how the policy committee will interact with the advisory committee or with the NTMA in general and, for that matter, why is was felt necessary to establish a separate committee. Why could the two matters not be dealt with by one committee? I am anxious to hear the Minister expand further on that matter.</P>
    <P>I am not sure &ndash; this is a very important point &ndash; how it will interact with the Attorney General, whose role is already established in law. As I understand it, under the Bill the Attorney General will be entitled, should he choose to do so, to have information passed to him by the agency about particular cases. The Attorney General will also be able to instruct the agency to discontinue dealing with a particular case. However, I am not sure whether the Attorney General will be entitled to inform the agency about how it might deal with a particular case. I suspect it is not envisaged that the Attorney General would do this very often but it is not clear whether he retains that power. In my view, the wording in the Bill is not sufficiently clear in this regard.</P>
    <P>There may be occasions where the Attorney General would choose to instruct the agency to deal with cases in a particular way. As stated earlier, there are cases where we would not want the agency to deal on a purely commercial basis with individual claims. In such circumstances, the Attorney General might seek to intervene and direct that matters be dealt with in a certain way. Will such powers be granted or does the Minister see the power to withdraw a case from the agency as being sufficient to safeguard the State's interests in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Bill is confined to broad areas such as damage to property and damage to the person where actual loss occurs. Why was it not cast more broadly than that? Why was it not stated that the agency would deal with all cases against the State and then rely on the mechanism which exists to withdraw particular cases should it be felt wise or necessary to do so? Why restrict it specifically to damage to property and to the person? Why can it not deal with cases involving unfair dismissal or defamation? If a particular Minister in the course of his or her duty is accused of defamation, why should the agency not be in a position to deal with the case? I do <Col N="1356" /> not understand the thinking behind this provision and perhaps the Minister can enlighten me.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the provision in the Bill relating to insurance under which the agency is entitled to advise in relation to insurance and take out insurance to safeguard against particular types of claims. What is the current practice? Is the State, as it operates, for example, through vocational education committees or health boards, insured?</P>
    <P>The Bill's other provisions make common sense. However, I wish to ask some further questions. The provision of a treasury service, as Deputy Noonan stated, is simply a matter of common sense. Dublin Corporation, for example, deals with an annual budget of something in excess of £300 million. I do not know what its practices are but certainly there is a great deal of money abroad at any given time, whether it is ratepayers' money or money paid directly from the central fund by the Government to local authorities. It is correct that they should have available to them the sort of facility which is being established in the part of the Bill which deals with treasury services.</P>
    <P>Is the limit on services overly restrictive? As I understand it, the Bill restricts it entirely to taking moneys on deposit and making advances. I am not sure whether other facilities could not be provided. My understanding was that these services would be provided by the agency on an agency basis and that the NTMA would take money we were putting on deposit and seek a rate in the wholesale market or simply use the high street banks and, perhaps because of its unique position, obtain good short-term rates. However, the Bill is not entirely clear in that regard.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity to try to tease out the operations of the Post Office Savings Bank fund with the Minister's officials yesterday, a matter I have had grave difficulty coming to terms with for a number of years. Thanks to their patient efforts, I am somewhat closer to understanding how it works. However, I remain unsure about one aspect of it, namely, whether it is intended that the NTMA, through the post office fund, would, in effect, act as a bank. Would it be using the fund as a short-term means of putting money on deposit and providing it back to the authorities that had given it money in the first instance? Is it intended in all cases that the NTMA will farm the money out or obtain advances from high street banks on the wholesale market, or is it intended that, in certain cases, the post office fund could be used by the NTMA to provide those services itself, which would lead to it, in effect, operating as a bank?</P>
    <P>The fund investment service is welcome. However, it appears to be cast in limited terms, only dealing with a fund which is under the management or control of a Minister. In current circumstances, this seems to restrict it largely to the social insurance fund. I am not sure that this should be the case. Does the Minister understand the wording as it currently stands to exclude <Col N="1357" /> money under the control of the Revenue Commissioners, for example? Is it intended that moneys currently held or invested by the Central Bank should be invested as part of this fund? It is not clear what the intention or the legal position is. Is it intended that the Central Bank moneys will be taken and put into the fund or is it possible that this could be done using this legislation at some time in the future? Clearly the social insurance fund is not the only repository of State funds. It would make sense if we were in a position to offer the same facility to all funds available to the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, and presumably the Minister for Finance, will be obliged to agree the terms under which the social insurance fund can be invested or deposited. In dealing with moneys of this kind which are held by the Minister on trust, we should seek, perhaps by Statute, to safeguard the capital concerned. It is not sufficient simply to provide that the terms under which the money can be used will be agreed between the Minister and the agency. We should look more carefully at this issue. The money is being held by the Minister on trust for people who have made social insurance contributions. It is their money and it is unconscionable that the amount of money available in the fund should be less at the end of a given period that at the start because of the way it was invested. We should be more restrictive in prescribing how this money should be invested.</P>
    <P>I have questions regarding the workings of the Bill but I welcome the principle underlying it. It has been a long time coming and I am delighted that we are now discussing it. It will make a great deal more sense to manage matters in the proposed organised fashion rather than the mishmash of the past. I support the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

        <b>:</b> There are some good provisions in the Bill but their potential depends on how they are put into effect and administered in practice. The effectiveness of the State claims agency will depend on how it is administered. I have concerns regarding how narrowly the remit of the claims agency might be interpreted by the Minister and those responsible for putting it into effect. Will the approach taken be purely legalistic and will the overriding concern be to minimise costs to the State?</P>
      <P>The Minister said the agency intends to adopt a commercial approach to claims management. I would have no truck with false or fraudulent claims against any agency of the State or with any effort by an individual or group to gain taxpayers' funds through fraud or fraudulent representation. However, questions must be asked about how the State claims agency will deal with issues which could be extremely sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the range of the remit of the claims agency. The Bill refers to loss of life, personal injury and loss or damage to property. How widely will personal injury be <Col N="1358" /> interpreted? The case of Jamie Sinnott which was recently adjudicated on in the High Court related to a claim by a mother for negligence by the State in the education provision for her son who suffers from autism. Would such a case come under the remit of the State claims agency? The agency will not simply deal with accident claims against local authorities, for example.</P>
    <P>The policy committee provided for in section 12 comes into focus in this regard. The Bill provides for the establishment by the Minister of a policy committee which will advise the agency on policy and procedures in relation to its claim management and risk management functions and makes specific provisions in that regard. Will the remit of the policy committee take matters of human compassion, the social responsibility of the State and justice into account? The case of Mrs. Brigid McCole is one in which the State was neither compassionate nor just in treating someone who was injured by an agency of the State.</P>
    <P>Will the remit of the policy committee and the State claims agency be broad enough to take account of the factors of social justice which arise in cases such as those already before the courts? Following the Jamie Sinnott case, another case is being heard regarding a facility which caters for autistic children. Would the policy committee be expected to examine the obligation of the State regarding the education of children with a disability to ensure they live the fullest life possible? The Sinnott case has many other serious implications for children who suffer from ADHD, the attention deficiency syndrome which is a major problem in a number of schools. There will be further claims against the State with regard to this disability. Can the remit of the policy committee and the agency be so broad as to look into these matters and advise Departments and State agencies on the avoidance of such claims by providing, in the first instance, that no injury is done in the case of people with disabilities to their mental and physical development?</P>
    <P>Section 11 places an obligation on State authorities to report to the agency as soon as may be any adverse incident which may give rise to a compensation claim at a later stage. If there is a narrow interpretation and there is an incident in which a State agency is involved and there is clearly the possibility of a claim against the State, this can be easily dealt with, but this may not apply in the case of the local authorities which face a massive number of claims. Leaving frivolous and fraudulent claims aside, genuine claims can and do arise from negligence, albeit not deliberate, on the part of local authorities due to the circumstances in which they find themselves. Lack of personnel and funds can lead to a situation where the infrastructure for which local authorities are responsible is left in a dangerous condition. Roads and footpaths, for example, may be left in a state of disrepair. This can cause genuine injury which then becomes a major burden on the local authority concerned in meeting the claims submitted. This applies to the entire list of areas <Col N="1359" /> for which local authorities are responsible, including public lighting and road traffic arrangements. Investment in advance in all these areas could avoid an enormous number of such claims.</P>
    <P>It should be part of the remit of the policy committee and the State claims agency to require local authorities to conduct a regular audit of risk factors within their functional areas. As a matter of practice, each local authority should have a troubleshooter or a lookout to identify such problems, not primarily to save money, although that is important, but in the interests of public safety and providing better services for citizens. The policy committee and the State's claims agency should not react to events, rather they should take on the role of ensuring State agencies prevent accidents and happenings which at a later stage can cause them to pay out large amounts of money which could be much better invested in improving infrastructure and other services.</P>
    <P>Another function of the central treasury service will be to offer deposit and loan facilities to health boards, vocational education committees etc., with a view to achieving savings for the Exchequer. Will the Minister clarify what is meant by this? Obviously, money should not be wasted needlessly, but I hope there is no hint that the State will adopt a penny-pinching attitude whereby savings will accrue to the Exchequer rather than the health board or local authority concerned. Any savings should be used to provide better services.</P>
    <P>There should be a requirement on the bodies concerned, for example, local authorities, to use the central treasury service rather than the banks where loan facilities are available on better terms. Deputy Noonan referred to deposit rates. The same applies to loans. Local authorities should be required to ensure money which swells the already bloated profits of the banks is saved through the central treasury agency for investment in services. Why should loan facilities be restricted to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies? They should be extended to publicly-owned companies generally. Financial institutions have bled semi-State companies and the State sector dry for many decades and made enormous profits in the process.</P>
    <P>Last June I tabled a question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment relating to the size of the State guaranteed debt of Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta. She informed me in reply that in 1987 when Irish Fertilisers Industries was formed from a joint venture between NET and Imperial Chemical Industries Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta became the holding company for the State's 51% shareholding in IFI. At the time of the joint venture NET retained approximately £164 million of its historically accumulated State guaranteed debt. The last sentence left me breathless. From 1987 to the end of NET's financial year in September 1999 NET paid £188 million in interest on a debt of £164 million. That is absolutely incredible. This kind of <Col N="1360" /> grotesque abuse of a State body to the advantage of financial institutions should prompt the Minister to make some good suggestions on how to save public agencies money. When I requested details of the financial institutions which made this killing at the State's expense NET informed me in writing that it would not supply them as it was commercially sensitive information or words to that effect. This is something the Minister should seriously consider.</P>

      <P>The Courts Bill, 2000, proposes to broaden the pool of lawyers from which High Court and Supreme Court judges can be selected, to provide for greater openness and transparency in the making of judicial appointments, to require the sanction of an appropriate Oireachtas committee for the appointment of a retired judge to a domestic or international body, to ensure the tax affairs of those appointed to the Judiciary are in order and to reform structures and outdated practices within the legal profession. The Bill is proposed by me and Deputy Higgins on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>The 1937 Constitution in Article 6.1 provides for a tripartite division of powers, stating that</P>
      <P>All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
      <P>Central to this doctrine of the separation of powers is the independence of the Judiciary. Montesquieu explained the importance of an independent judiciary as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to <Col N="1361" /> arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive, the judge might behave with violence and oppression.</P>
    <P>The independence of the Judiciary is copper fastened in this State by constitutional provision and it is the Constitution which lays down the fundamental basic law relating to the appointment of judges. Legislation enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to judicial appointments is, therefore, circumscribed by constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>All judicial appointments in this State, whether they be judges in the District, Circuit, High or Supreme Court are made by the President on the advice of the Government. This is provided for by Articles 35.1 and 13.9 of the Constitution. Article 35.1 states that, &ldquo;The judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other Courts established in pursuance of Article 34 hereof shall be appointed by the President.&rdquo;  However, the Government selects the judges. The President is required when exercising this function by Article 13.9 to act &ldquo;only on the advice of the Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, put in place for the first time a statutory mechanism for advertising judicial vacancies and short-listing applicants for judicial appointments. Under the Act, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advertises judicial vacancies to be filled. The board can identify persons through their own application or the board's invitation who are suitably qualified for judicial office and then in the context of each judicial vacancy may submit a list of up to seven names to Government for the particular judicial position. The Government may select for judicial appointment one of the seven persons listed by the board or may nominate a person not listed by the board.</P>
    <P>Where the person nominated by government is not included on the board's shortlist, that fact must be stated by notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> In practice, since the board's establishment, all judicial appointments made by successive Governments have been from persons included in the board's shortlist submitted to Government. The remit of the board excludes the offices of Chief Justice and the presidents of the other courts, but in relation to those offices the Government is subject to some limitations in that it is required to &ldquo;have regard first&rdquo; to the qualifications and suitability of existing judges. Where the Government proposes to appoint a person to those positions who is already a judge, the board is not involved.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established to ensure that those appointed to the Judiciary had the legal competence, character and temperament to properly fill a judicial vacancy. The procedure established under the 1995 Act superseded the informal processes pursued previously by successive governments up to that point. The 1995 Act does not interfere with the Government's constitutional right and obligation to nominate members of the Judiciary. It merely <Col N="1362" /> seeks to ensure there is a mechanism in place to permit those eligible to apply for such appointment and a body available to assess their eligibility and expertise. However, this is done behind closed doors and the first time the public or Members of the Oireachtas learn of a judicial appointment is when the Government submits the name of its nominee to the President for appointment. There is no openness or transparency about the process nor does the Oireachtas, to which the Government is accountable, have a direct role.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes there should be greater governmental accountability for the making of judicial appointments and that there should be proper parliamentary scrutiny. The Courts Bill, 2000, requires, therefore, that prior to the Government formally advising the President of the name of its nominee to a judicial office, it shall first submit the name of its proposed nominee to an appropriate committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall take into consideration the opinion of that committee. At present the appropriate committee would be the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Upon being furnished by the Government with the name of its proposed nominee, the committee will be entitled to determine whether it should hold any hearing on the nomination or whether it should require the person proposed for appointment as a judge to attend before it. The committee, under the Bill will thereafter furnish to Government its opinion on the nomination which will be published and laid before this House.</P>
    <P>This new procedure, which implements a proposal contained in the recently published Fine Gael policy document, A Democratic Revolution, will ensure parliamentary scrutiny of judicial nominations and provide for a new openness and transparency in the making of judicial appointments. In doing so, it does not in any way impinge on the Government's constitutional role in recommending to the President a person to be appointed to judicial office. Should the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights issue an opinion opposing the appointment of a particular nominee, it could be expected that the Government would be very reluctant to proceed with an appointment. It would be expected that the Government would not then submit to the President the name of such a person initially nominated by it for that appointment.</P>
    <P>A major public controversy was caused by the Government's attempt to appoint former Supreme Court justice Hugh O'Flaherty to the board of the European Investment Bank. At present the Government is at liberty to appoint retired judges, including judges who have been impeached or threatened with impeachment, to international and domestic bodies without such appointments first requiring the prior approval of either the Houses of the Oireachtas or an appropriate Oireachtas committee. The independence <Col N="1363" /> of the Judiciary is a central core value of our constitutional democracy. Appointments by Government of retired members of the Judiciary to international or domestic bodies are matters of particular sensitivity. Under our constitutional system of separation of powers, the Executive should be properly accountable to the Legislature for any such proposed appointments prior to the appointment being taken up and there is a need for a mechanism which ensures the Government cannot make such appointments where they are opposed by a majority of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Courts Bill, 2000, provides that no person who has occupied a judicial office and has ceased to occupy that office due to retirement or impeachment may be appointed by the Government or any Minister of State to any office or employment unless the Government has first submitted the name of that person to the appropriate Oireachtas committee, which at present would be the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. It further provides that no such appointment shall be made without the prior approval of that committee.</P>
    <P>If this provision had been in place last May, the Government would have known that it could not have made the appointment of former Supreme Court justice Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank without such appointment being first approved by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. If such a provision had been in place the Minister for Finance would not have originated that proposal, the Government would have avoided a great deal of public controversy, the country would not have been involved in any international embarrassment and the Ryan and O'Flaherty families would not again have been thrown into the public limelight and would have avoided much upset and distress.</P>
    <P>Ordinary legislation specifies the eligibility criteria for judicial appointment. Eligibility is confined to members of the legal profession, that is, to barristers and solicitors. To be eligible for appointment as a judge of the Circuit Court or District Court, a person must be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing. Only practising barristers of not less than 12 years standing are eligible for direct appointment to the superior courts, that is, the High Court and Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, for the first time permitted the appointment to the Circuit Court of practising solicitors of ten years standing. When published as a Bill, this measure did not envisage the appointment of practising solicitors to either the High Court or the Supreme Court nor did it provide for a practising solicitor, having been appointed as a Circuit Court judge, becoming eligible for appointment to either the High or the Supreme Court. During the debate in this House and on Committee Stage of the <Col N="1364" /> Courts and Court Officers Bill, I proposed that the pool of lawyers from which superior court judges are selected should be substantially widened to ensure judges were selected from lawyers with a diversity of experience and from different backgrounds which could be reflected on the bench.</P>
    <P>The proposal was also made as since the coming into force of the Courts Act, 1971, a measure steered through this House by Deputy O'Malley, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, solicitors had an equal right of audience in our superior courts to that of barristers. Almost 25 years later, it seemed both illogical and discriminatory that a law from a different era which restricted eligibility for High and Supreme Court judicial appointments to members of the Bar should continue to remain in place. I should also say in the context of making a personal declaration of interest, as one of a very small number of solicitors who have for many years acted as advocates in our superior courts, I was at that time firmly of the view, and still remain of the view, that qualities of either legal brilliance or personal eccentricity are shared in equal measure as between members of the Bar and the solicitors' profession. In the context of there being approximately 1,300 practising barristers in the State as compared to 5,500 practising solicitors approximately, it is clearly in the public interest that the selection of High Court and Supreme Court judges should not be confined to practising members of the Bar who constitute just over 20% of practising lawyers in the State.</P>
    <P>As a result of the debate I initiated on the 1995 Act and in response to amendments tabled by me on Committee Stage to that Act which gave rise to considerable controversy, the Government agreed to amend the measure to allow for the appointment as judges of the High Court solicitors appointed as Circuit Court judges who had served in the Circuit Court for in excess of four years.</P>
    <P>In response to the debate on the 1995 Act, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on 10 December 1996 appointed a working group on qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts. This working group finally reported on 16 February 1999 and recommended that appointment to the High Court and Supreme Court should no longer be confined to practising barristers but should also extend to practising litigation solicitors.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, and the predecessor to that Act, eligibility for appointment as a High Court or Supreme Court judge was confined to a practising barrister of not less than 12 years standing. Despite the 1995 Act permitting the promotion of solicitor Circuit Court judges with four years experience as a Circuit Court judge to the High Court, no solicitor has yet been so appointed to the High Court. The Courts Bill, 2000, provides for the direct appointment as judges to the High Court or Supreme Court of practising litigation <Col N="1365" /> solicitors as well as practising barristers who have been such for at least ten years, including a continuous period of two years immediately prior to the date of such judicial appointment.</P>
    <P>At present appointment to the District Court or Circuit Court requires that a person be a barrister or solicitor of only ten years standing. It is the view of Fine Gael that there is no public need or interest in maintaining a distinction between the number of years lawyers should be qualified to be eligible for appointment as judges of the superior courts as compared with the lower courts. In many areas of law, the Circuit Court exercises a jurisdiction concurrent with and identical to the High Court. If Circuit Court judges are deemed qualified upon appointment to hear a broad range of cases, similar or identical to cases which can be heard in the High Court, it is not in the public interest nor in the interest of the Judiciary that a suggestion could arise that by virtue of the eligibility criteria for appointment, Circuit Court judges are in some way less qualified to determine such cases than are High Court judges. The current 12 year rule requires a period of time in legal practice in excess of that required for eligibility for judicial appointment in most other common law jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Courts Act, 2000, practising barristers and High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitors will be equally eligible for judicial appointment to the High Court or Supreme Court. The requirement that each have &ldquo;at least ten years practising experience&rdquo; does not require that the ten years be continuous. The ten year period can be interrupted by other work they may have undertaken. The Bill, however, requires a continuous period of two years as a practising barrister or a High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitor immediately prior to appointment as a judge of the Supreme or High Court. In this context it reflects a recommendation contained in the working group's report.</P>
    <P>The working group recommended that there should be no change to the existing position whereby District Court judges are not eligible for appointment to the High Court or Supreme Court. Appointment as a judge of the District Court requires that a person appointed has a minimum of ten years as a practising solicitor or barrister. A District Court judge hears on a daily basis criminal trials and adjudicates on contentious issues of civil or family law. Fine Gael sees no public interest in excluding from eligibility for appointment to the High Court or Supreme Court District Court judges who on a daily basis by the nature of their job acquire substantial experience across a broad range of litigation. Such persons prior to being appointed District Court judges under the recommendations made by the working group and also under the provisions of this Bill could, prior to appointment to the District Court, be eligible for appointment to a higher court.</P>
    <P>The Courts Bill, 2000, states: &ldquo;.service as a judge of the Circuit Court or of the District Court <Col N="1366" /> shall be deemed to be practice as a practising barrister or a High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitor.&rdquo;  It is important that individuals who are judges of the courts of justice or of the court of first instance attached to that court or who are acting as advocate general of the Court of Justice are not excluded from judicial appointment in this State. Accordingly, the Bill also provides that service in such position &ldquo;shall be deemed to be practice as a practising barrister or a High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitor&rdquo; and that also upon a person vacating any such office he or she shall be regarded as qualified for appointment as a judge of the High or Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The procedures in place for the appointment of members of the Judiciary are designed not only to ensure that those appointed are properly qualified to exercise judicial functions but also to depoliticise appointments made in so far as is possible. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board goes about its business in a non-party political way and since its establishment no Government has appointed a person to a judicial office who has not been short-listed by the board in circumstances in which the 1995 Act provides for such short-listing. It is inevitable that included in the short-lists of persons properly qualified for judicial appointment are men and women identified with the various political parties in this State, including the Government parties. It is clear from a reply received under the Freedom of Information Act from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 31 July 2000 by Mr. Brian Gallagher who, as a solicitor, sought information as convenor of the litigation committee of the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association that current Oireachtas members of Fianna Fáil, including the Taoiseach, and the Progressive Democrats, in addition to Independent Deputies on whom the Government depends, have since the Government came into office regularly made written representations in favour of specific individuals receiving a judicial nomination.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on Thursday, 5 October, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform confirmed that since taking office he has received over 40 representations from members of the Oireachtas in respect of judicial appointments. Although in the reply the Minister stated that eight persons on whose behalf representations were made were subsequently appointed, all to the District Court Bench, he stated that he did not regard these representations as particularly relevant. To date, a total of ten appointments have been made by the Government to the District Court, eight of which are in respect of individuals on whose behalf the Minister has received representations.</P>
    <P>If those representations, to use the Minister's words, are not regarded by him as &ldquo;particularly relevant&rdquo; why is he in receipt of them not only from the Taoiseach but also from so many of his ministerial colleagues. In addition to representations being made to the Taoiseach, represen<Col N="1367" /> tations have been received by the Minister since 21 April 1998 from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the former Minister for Health and Children, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. Are the letters sent by individual Ministers advocating a particular appointment circulated to the ministerial colleagues of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Is it as a result of receiving such letters that the Minister proposes at Cabinet the nomination to the Judiciary of a particular applicant included as one of the seven in the list submitted to him by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?</P>
    <P>Between 21 April 1998 and 31 July 2000, in relation to District Court appointments it seems that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received 29 representations from elected members of the Government parties, 27 from Fianna Fáil and two from the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>In addition, one representation was received from Ray McSharry, a former senior Government Minister and a current trustee of the Fianna Fáil Party, concerning a District Court appointment. During the same period, according to the information supplied under the Freedom of Information Act, seven representations were received relating to judicial appointments to the Circuit Court, four of which were made by members of Fianna Fáil, including the Taoiseach, yet again, and Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In the context of a District Court appointment, Deputy Healy-Rae made representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in writing. It was not enough simply to have a word with him in a pub in Kerry. Deputy Blaney made representations to the Minister in relation to a Circuit Court appointment.</P>
    <P>Are the Independent Deputies, on whom the Government is dependent, now dictating who should receive judicial appointments? When will Deputy Fox and Deputy Gildea get their turn to propose somebody for nomination to the Judiciary? Has the Minister told them that this is an opportunity of which they can avail? Is this something the Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, discusses with them in the privacy of their weekly meetings to ensure they are kept on board?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should answer the questions I have raised and a number of others. First, why have the District Court appointments been targeted by the majority of representations he received? Did the Minister at any time prior to the parliamentary <Col N="1368" /> question of 5 October being tabled make it known to his ministerial colleagues, to backbench members of the Government parties or to the Independent Deputies on whose support the Government is dependent, that he did not regard these representations &ldquo;as particularly relevant&rdquo;, to use his own words? Alternatively, did he make it known that he would facilitate such representations? Could the Minister clarify how relevant they are if he regards them as &ldquo;not particularly relevant&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>He should also clarify why eight out of the ten appointments made by him to the District Court Bench were nominated to the District Court after he was in receipt of political representations on their behalf. The Taoiseach should explain why he declined to answer a parliamentary question tabled to him last week which sought to ascertain whether any of the individuals, on whose behalf he had made written representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have to date received a judicial appointment and which sought an explanation for his making representations in circumstances in which his own Minister regards his representations as &ldquo;not particularly relevant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have in Government violated both the spirit and the intent of the 1995 Act. They have sought to corrupt the provisions of that Act in so far as it is available to them to do so. Undoubtedly, at all stages, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has acted with integrity. I accept that all appointments made by the present Government derive from lists of seven names furnished by the board. However, the number of persons appointed by the Minister to the District Court as a result of receipt by him of representations from his own colleagues or from Government friendly Independent Deputies leads heavily to the suspicion that if one is short listed by the board, one is more likely to be appointed to a District Court vacancy if representations are made on one's behalf by a member of one of the Government parties or by an Independent Deputy on whose support the Government parties are dependent.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a need to enact legislation to render it unlawful for any person to make any such representations and to require by law that any such representations received shall not be considered by the Minister or the Government in determining who should be nominated for judicial appointment. Various Acts relating to the making of appointments in the Civil Service and local authorities and also with regard to the prosecution of offences contain adequate legal precedents which could be applied to representations relating to judicial nominations.</P>
    <P>It is no longer tenable that in this Republic, 80 years after attaining statehood, we still apply anachronistic rules and principles inherited from our colonial past. The previous Government, in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, failed in its attempt to abolish the wearing of 19th century <Col N="1369" /> wigs by barristers who appear before our courts. Under pressure from the Law Library, a provision in that legislation which proposed to abolish the wearing of wigs was amended to confer on barristers a discretion to determine whether they should or should not wear wigs. As a consequence, the overwhelming majority of barristers continue to dress in 19th century garb except when appearing in family law cases for which the wearing of wigs was abolished in the Private Members Bill that I brought through this House, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989. Most newly qualified junior counsel wear wigs due to peer pressure by their elders and a fear that if they abandon the wig, it could detrimentally impact on their legal careers. The wearing of wigs, however, has minimal impact on the general public and is more an item of curiosity. There are more serious issues to be tackled than the wearing of wigs.</P>
    <P>As already noted, since the Courts Act, 1971 solicitors have had a full right of audience before all our courts, including the High Court and the Supreme Court. The legislation of this Republic, therefore, recognises that litigation solicitors are as well intellectually equipped in the law as are members of the Law Library who act as advocates. This is something the Government still fails to recognise in the context of various matters for which it has responsibility. For example, there is no legal provision of which I am aware which excludes a solicitor from appointment to the important constitutional post of Attorney General. No provision is contained in our Constitution which states that qualification for appointment as Attorney General is confined to members of the Law Library.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, in our document &ldquo;A Democratic Revolution&rdquo;, proposes that not only in law but also in practice solicitors should be regarded as eligible for such appointment. Section 7 of the Courts Bill 2000 provides that &ldquo;notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary, a solicitor shall be qualified for appointment as Attorney General&rdquo;. The enactment of such a provision would ensure that future Taoisigh have available to them a far wider pool of lawyers from which to select Attorneys General. In the context of it now being acknowledged that solicitors should be eligible for appointment as High Court and Supreme Court Judges, it makes no sense that they should be excluded from appointment in the future as Attorneys General.</P>
    <P>Not only is the legal profession in this State divided into two branches of solicitors and barristers, but barristers make a distinction as between junior and senior counsel. Experienced barristers are appointed senior counsel as recognition of their experience and seniority. In complex litigation that comes before our courts, it is usual that both a senior and junior counsel represent a litigant, be the litigant an individual, a company, a trade union, an organisation, a club or the State or a State agency. In cases of great complexity <Col N="1370" /> two senior counsel and one junior counsel may appear.</P>
    <P>As already noted, since 1971 solicitors have been free to act as advocates in all our courts. On occasions in the High or Supreme Court a case of complexity may arise in which a solicitor is acting as advocate and in which it is in the interests of the client for whom the solicitor acts that the client be represented in court by more than one advocate. While it is commonplace in our courts for an individual to be represented by both a senior and a junior counsel, it is not usual where a litigant requires representation by two advocates that a case is conducted in the context of the taking of evidence, cross-examination and the making of legal submissions jointly by a solicitor and barrister. Most junior counsel believe that their senior peers would disapprove should they act jointly in a court hearing with a litigation solicitor or a solicitor acting as advocate.</P>
    <P>I am aware that solicitors have written on occasion to the chairman of the Bar Council to seek to have this difficulty resolved but despite doing so, the Bar Council has declined to address this issue. This is a restrictive practice and contrary to the public interest which results in litigants incurring more legal costs than are necessary in circumstances in which a solicitor jointly with a barrister can properly represent their interests without the need to appoint a senior counsel.</P>
    <P>A person appointed as senior counsel is granted by the Government something called a patent of precedence. The Government's power to grant a patent of precedence is inherited from colonial times and the Courts Bill, 2000 proposes, notwithstanding any rule or law or statutory provision or practice to the contrary, the Government may grant patents of precedence at the Bar to High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitors. There is no reason a litigation solicitor with expertise and experience should not have extended to him or her the same recognition of seniority as is currently conferred on members of the Bar. The granting of such patents of precedence to solicitors will also effectively circumvent the restrictive practices operated by the Bar with regard to solicitors and barristers jointly acting as advocates in major litigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has for 18 months promised to introduce measures to render solicitors eligible for appointment as judges to the High and Supreme Courts. The Courts Bill, 2000, published in my name and that of Deputy Jim Higgins on behalf of Fine Gael, provides for this and also addresses broader issues which I have referred to and which we believe this House should address without further delay in the public interest.</P>
    <P>As is the case with practically every Bill published, including Private Members' Bills, I have no doubt technical and substantive amendments could be made to this measure to improve it. The Bill, however, opens the door to implementing important and far-reaching reforms which will <Col N="1371" /> modernise our legal system and provide for greater openness and transparency in making judicial appointments which will substantially benefit the general public.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment to the justice brief, I have noted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's regular reference to Private Members' Bills published by him when on the Opposition benches and to the generosity of the previous Government in taking on board and enacting into legislation proposals made by him. In the same spirit, I am asking the Minister not to oppose this measure and to permit it to pass unopposed into committee to facilitate its enactment into law before the end of this year.</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I compliment my colleague, Deputy Shatter, who is the main architect of this Bill. As he said, the Bill seeks to introduce basic best practice procedures in the process of the selection of judges. As he has acknowledged, the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, is a considerable milestone in the process of judicial appointments in that the Judicial Appointments Board now advertises, consults and deliberates, and accepts the nominations of people who deign it worthwhile to make an application for the post. Seven names go before Cabinet, one of the names is selected and, as has been acknowledged, it has never happened that names which have not been on the list have been parachuted in to take precedence over the selected seven. Therefore, there has been a considerable advance in relation to opening up the process while at the same time it is, by and large, a closed shop. This is the reason Deputy Shatter and I have brought forward this measure to introduce the openness, transparency and accountability that is now part and parcel of every aspect of life.</P>
      <P>The courts are the cornerstone of the Constitution and democracy and are responsible for the administration of justice. We cannot allow for the possibility of cronyism. This is the reason the Bill seeks to root out, once and for all, any taint or suspicion of cronyism. The Bill does four things. First, from the point of view of one's nomination, the nominee to a judicial position will now have his or her nomination considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The committee may seek among its majority members to have the matter dealt with by way of oral hearing. In addition, we set down clearly that no retired judge can be appointed to a domestic or international body without the committee's approval. As has already been said, the likelihood is that the O'Flaherty appointment would never have been made if this provision had been introduced, even though that does not take account of the arrogance of the Minister for Finance in relation to such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General's office is dominated by people from the Bar. All the staff in that office come through the Bar. The possibility of the appointment of solicitors has been in existence <Col N="1372" /> for some time but this has not been addressed. There is no legal prohibition on solicitors being considered for such posts. The Bill will ensure, therefore, that the broadest possible pool of expertise is available to the Attorney General's office. Last, but by no means least, it will enable direct appointments of solicitors to High Court and Supreme Court positions. As Deputy Shatter said, at present only barristers with 12 years experience may be appointed to the High Court. The Bill makes it possible for any solicitor with ten years litigation experience to be so appointed. Since 1995, a solicitor who has been appointed to the Circuit Court, having four years experience in that court, may now be appointed to the High Court. However, the proof of the pudding is that to date no such appointment has been made.</P>
    <P>Given the requirement to preserve judicial independence, it is acknowledged that the Legislature or Executive has very narrow powers in dealing with complaints in relation to misconduct by judges. A judge of the High Court may only be removed from office on grounds of stated misbehaviour or incapacity and then only by resolution of the Dáil and Seanad, in accordance with the provisions of Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution. Statutes provide a similar provision for Circuit or District Court judges. In April 1999 in the Sheedy case we faced an unprecedented constitutional dilemma. The Government threatened to invoke the impeachment procedures in the Constitution to remove from office High Court judge, Cyril Kelly, and Supreme Court judge, Hugh O'Flaherty. We do not know what would have happened had they refused the Government's request. There would certainly have been an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Thankfully, the judges resigned, but had they not resigned, they would have been entitled to due process. They would have been entitled to have their case stated, to be heard. However, the question is by whom, when, how and where because this never happened before. No procedures were in place. They were entitled to legal representation and natural justice.</P>
    <P>At the time, the Government, knowing that it could have been facing an unprecedented crisis, promised that this matter would be addressed as a matter of urgency, but to date nothing has happened. There is no guarantee a similar crisis will not arise in future and that in such a case those involved might not be nearly as accommodating as the former Supreme Court and High Court judges.</P>
    <P>Then there was the extraordinary spectacle of Mr. O'Flaherty offering to come before the committee to answer questions, resigning on foot of a £40,000 pension from the Government and, subsequently, refusing to come before the committee to which he had offered his services merely weeks previously. He then went on &ldquo;Today FM&rdquo; and contradicted many of the assertions he made at the time of his resignation in relation to his protestations of innocence.</P>
    <P>The question is what constitutes a judicial func<Col N="1373" /> tion and where does one draw the line? Not only has the process of impeachment not been sorted out in respect of judges, but the powers of the committee to deal with the issue have still not been sorted out. Deputy Howlin and I deliberated at length in the committee with legal opinion and other members of the committee as to what form of inquiry could be instituted or where precisely our powers lay in relation to investigating further the Sheedy affair. We considered six options. First, we considered the informal inquiry which is dependent on the co-operation of all parties. The joint committee has no powers of compellability to summon witnesses or evidence or make records available. Even if such persons were prepared to co-operate and come before the committee &ndash; that did not seem possible in the Sheedy case &ndash; the question of the separation of powers came into play immediately. Therefore, an informal inquiry could merely gather information. The second option we considered was to seek from the Oireachtas powers to send for persons, papers or records, in other words, to give ourselves the powers. Section 3 of the Compellability Act, 1997, excludes such judges, therefore, that option was a non-runner.</P>
    <P>The committee considered also the possibility of overcoming the procedural difficulties by amending the 1997 Act by removing the prohibition against compelling judges. Again, this would have to exclude judicial function and give rise to the question of what constitutes in strict legal terminology judicial functions. The committee considered amending Article 35.2 of the Constitution to compel judges to appear and be questioned on matters relating to their judicial function. This would have been a major step but I do not think anyone wanted to go down that road. We considered the possibility of a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry Evidence Act, 1921. The Dáil would have to be satisfied that the terms of the resolution were constitutional and did not infringe on the separation of powers. Had we gone that route, the likelihood is that it would have been challenged. We considered the possibility of having the matter returned to the Chief Justice who declined the offer.</P>
    <P>We are extremely lacking in relation to procedures. A mechanism is still not in place, in regard to impeachment procedures, to deal with the crisis with which we could have been confronted in April 1999. Nothing has happened in terms of making judges accountable for their actions without at the same time infringing on their constitutional protection. I acknowledge that the commission chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham has produced an analysis in regard to options and examples but we have not embarked on any meaningful steps with regard to the model to be embraced.</P>
    <P>The report of the Constitution review group in May 1996 recommended the possibility of introducing legislation and this reality has not been addressed. I hope the Minister will accept the Bill in the positive spirit in which it was proposed and <Col N="1374" /> that something is done to try to ensure there is greater openness, transparency and accountability in relation to this fundamental aspect of society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has already made clear, by way of commitments in its legislation programme, that it accepts the principle that solicitors should be eligible for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts. The Government, therefore, has no problem with the principle enshrined in this Bill&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but there are good and valid reasons why the Bill cannot be supported by the Government in the form that it takes, in this and other matters. Those reasons will become clear during my contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>I endorse wholeheartedly the principle which the Bill espouses and wish to see it enshrined in legislation. It will give me immense pleasure, in what I expect will be the near future, to introduce a Government Bill which will deal not just with the eligibility of solicitors for appointment to the superior courts but with a range of other court-related matters. I have to tread somewhat delicately because it would be improper for me to dwell in particular detail upon the provisions of the Bill which is going before Government for approval to publish.</P>
      <P>However, there will be significant points of difference on the issue of eligibility between it and the Bill we are debating. Considerable additional matters will also be included within the scope of the Government's Bill which are not comprehended by the Deputy's Bill and which will, for the most part, facilitate the administration of our courts system.</P>
      <P>The argument is sometimes made that Governments should accept Private Members' Bills where the principle of the Bill is broadly acceptable and then deal with any defects or additional matters at Committee Stage. Sometimes this approach can work well. However, in this instance, a Government Bill is almost ready for publication. Its scope is much broader than the Bill we are debating and it would not be efficient in terms of resources or time if it were to be accepted and then amended to take account of the content of my Department's Bill, both in so far as that content relates to the content of the Deputy's Bill and in so far as it differs. Certainly, were I to take that approach, I can guarantee that we would have a messy and unsatisfactory Committee Stage and the opportunity to have a wide-ranging and open debate on the policy which underlines my Bill would be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will not take issue with me that a substantial portion of his Bill is a reasonably true and faithful reflection of the recommendations which were contained in the report of the work<Col N="1375" /> ing group on qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts. The working group was established in 1996, its report was published in February 1999 and Government approval for the drafting of the necessary legislation was obtained in June of that year.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations contained in the report, some of which the Deputy has taken on board fully and some of which he has modified, were as follows: eligibility for appointment as a judge of the High or Supreme Courts should be extended to solicitors of at least 12 years standing who have been engaged in litigation in those Courts for at least 10 years; in this context, experience and knowledge of the superior courts would be a prerequisite for eligibility for appointment for all persons, regardless of whether they are barristers or solicitors; five of the ten years High or Supreme Court litigation experience, which it is recommended would be required by solicitors, could be gained while employed in the public service or by a commercial entity &ndash; however, solicitors would have to spend a continuous period of two years in private practice immediately prior to their appointment as a judge and, related to this, would be the requirement that, subject to certain exceptions, barristers should also be in practice for an equal period of two years prior to any appointment, and cumulative relevant professional experience of a person who has practised both as barrister and solicitor would be reckonable for the purpose of the eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>In making its proposals, the members of the working group were unanimous in their view that, since the foundation of the State, Ireland has had a Judiciary of high quality which has served it well. It was against that background the group recommended that any change to the qualifications required for appointment to the Supreme Court and High Court be clearly reasoned and demonstrated to be in the public interest. Given the importance of the positions which are in question, change for change's sake can never be a factor in any decision to alter existing arrangements. At the same time, a settled adherence to existing tradition may not always be in the best interests of any profession and every so often it is desirable that we look hard at existing practices and determine whether or not some modifications are required.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am satisfied that it would be in the public interest that the pool from which judges can be chosen for appointment should be widened to include people with the experience and training deemed necessary to be considered as a potential judge of the superior courts, regardless of whether they are barristers or solicitors. The fundamental principle of broader eligibility has been accepted by the Government and I endorse it fully. However, the mechanism whereby that principle can be implemented is of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>There may well be a view that transposition of <Col N="1376" /> the blueprint offered by the report was all that was necessary in the matter and that little by way of additional work was called for. Leaving aside the inevitable slippages which are part and parcel of the development of legislative proposals, there are particular reasons in this instance why progress has not been as brisk as we might all have wished. While the proposals contained in the working group's report are unexceptionable with regard to principle, they needed to be fully examined and teased out to ensure that no deficiencies were contained within them.</P>
    <P>That process has suggested some difficulties with the approach taken in the report, which are close to resolution. It also suggested that the approach taken was, perhaps, unnecessarily rigid and that something a little less formulaic might work better in practice. However, lest Deputies leap to hasty conclusions, I cannot emphasise strongly enough how valuable was the work which the members of that group undertook and without it the task of my Department in framing the policy of the relevant legislative provisions would have been much harder. It is easy to forget that many who accept the onerous task of serving on a working group of this nature usually do so for no remuneration and often give up much of their personal and professional time to offer genuine service to the State. It behoves us to be grateful that this ethic of public service still exists strongly in so many of our people.</P>
    <P>Some of the concepts upon which the working group placed reliance in its report could give rise to uncertainty as to whether or not a particular solicitor was eligible for appointment to high judicial office. The House will appreciate that it is a serious matter if a challenge is mounted to a judge's jurisdiction on the basis that he or she had been invalidly appointed and that a successful challenge could have significant consequences. If a challenge were to be mounted in future against a solicitor judge, and if it were successful because of an inherent weakness in the enabling legislation, both the reputations of the Oireachtas and the profession itself would be damaged.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the precise formula which should apply so as to enable suitably qualified solicitors to serve as judges of both the High and Supreme Courts has been the subject of very careful and considered discussion between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General. I am satisfied, on the basis of advice received, that the approach we are embarking upon should not give rise to the difficulties I have referred to and should be capable of being applied in an objective manner which will not give rise to unnecessary dispute.</P>
    <P>The process of teasing out which I mentioned has also entailed close consultation with the relevant professional interests. The Bar Council and the Law Society have a natural and particular interest in the evolution of proposals which will impact closely upon them and, for that reason, I have taken some pains to ensure that a proper consultation mechanism has been put in place in <Col N="1377" /> so far as both those bodies are concerned. However, interest in the criteria for eligibility for judicial appointment is not confined to the professional bodies and I am acutely aware of the need to also take cognisance of those wider concerns.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has impacted on the timing of the Bill's publication will be familiar to anyone who has had the privilege to serve as a Minister in my Department. Any courts Bill has a way of expanding to take on board a range of issues which may not have been in contemplation when it was first mooted. Some of these inevitably require legislative intervention and it would be derelict of me were I to refuse to deal with them when a ready vehicle was to hand. The discipline of managing the legislative process also demands that some issues be left behind for another day, otherwise, a Bill would never emerge.</P>
    <P>This Courts and Court Officers Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and it has grown appreciably during its evolution. I am confident that its finalisation is imminent and that it is being accorded the priority which it merits. It goes without saying that I look forward with considerable anticipation to the debate which will take place following the Bill's publication in this current session.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which are dealt with in the Bill before the House on which I wish to comment. A particular provision has been included in the Bill which would make the office of Master of the High Court open both to solicitors and to barristers. At present, only persons who are barristers of not less than ten years standing and who are then actually practising are eligible for appointment to this office. Conversely, the office of Taxing Master is only open to persons who are solicitors of not less than ten years standing who are either actually practising then or have previously practised for not less than ten years.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill appears to lack a certain degree of reciprocity in that only the non-eligibility of solicitors is addressed. Obviously, if one were to do something in this area, a degree of even-handedness would be required. However, these offices are somewhat specialist in nature and it may not necessarily be the case that a change of the kind suggested is warranted at this time.</P>
    <P>The Bill also specifies that a solicitor shall be qualified for appointment as Attorney General notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary. I am not aware of any legislative barrier in this area and, as the Deputy will appreciate, legislative intervention is not necessary in order to effect a change in practice. I am not convinced that it would be prudent to have a statutory provision of the type suggested. This is without prejudice to any views I might have concerning the desirability of solicitors being appointed to the office of Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Perhaps not unrelated to the provision I men<Col N="1378" /> tioned is that concerning the granting of patents of precedence at the Bar to High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitors. In relation to such patents of precedence, the current arrangements governing this matter are that, on foot of an application received from a barrister, a patent of precedence may be granted by the Government on the basis of a recommendation by the Taoiseach, based on the advice of the Attorney General following discussions involving the Chief Justice, other senior members of the Judiciary and the chairman of the Bar Council.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, membership of the Senior Bar is a mark of eminence among barristers. It is not a requirement for gaining audience in the superior courts and the absence of a patent of precedence does not impinge in any way upon the ability of an appropriately skilled solicitor to act for his or her client before those courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill also has a number of provisions concerning compliance with the tax Acts. Deputies will be aware that the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, is before the House and is currently awaiting Second Stage. That Bill contains provisions which touch upon these matters in so far as holders of judicial office and holders of senior office are concerned. Matters to do with tax compliance of senior public servants in general are best considered within the broader framework which that legislation provides. I have some doubts as to the appropriateness of courts legislation for provisions of this kind.</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Bill deals with the service of court documents by post. This is essentially a technical provision but addresses an issue which has already been brought to my attention. The issue in question is one which will be dealt with in the Bill which is in preparation in my Department.</P>
      <P>The final matter of substance which is contained in this Private Members' Bill concerns a proposal which would introduce a radical change into the procedures which currently govern judicial appointment in this country. What appears to be envisaged is that prior to advising the President in relation to the appointment of a person to judicial office, the Government should consider the views of a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to whom the name of that person would have been submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear from the text of the Bill what the nature and extent of the role envisaged for that committee would be, although, presumably, the intention is that some view as to the suitability of that person for the office concerned would be <Col N="1379" /> formed. In addition, it is not clear whether that view would be formed in the abstract or whether the attendance of the individual concerned, coupled with the possibility for some kind of questioning, would be mandated.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to envisage how a system of this nature would work in practice and in a way which would not have the potential to impact adversely on our judicial system. The independence of our Judiciary, enshrined as it is in our Constitution, is a much cherished tradition and we have to be very careful that we do not move in a direction which might be seen as encroaching upon that tradition. We have in place, by virtue of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which, in many ways, is still in its infancy but which has, nonetheless, already made an impact in terms of providing a structure which puts an element of distance between the selection of judges and the political process.</P>
    <P>The board is composed of eminent individuals of the highest integrity who are well equipped for the delicate task of assessing which of the many individuals who apply for appointment to judicial office should be recommended for appointment to that office. It is a mark of the esteem in which the recommendations of the board are held that all persons nominated for judicial appointment since this Government took office have been drawn from lists submitted by that board. This is notwithstanding the fact that, under the Act, it would be open to the Government to ignore the recommendations of that board.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that in recommending a person for appointment to judicial office the board has to satisfy itself that the person concerned has met certain criteria which are set out in the Act. This is a way of ensuring that only individuals of appropriate competence and probity are recommended for such appointment. Deputy Shatter made some criticism of the Government in regard to the appointment of members of the Judiciary. However, the situation is that appointments are made on foot of recommendations received from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that all Governments, irrespective of their colour, have received representations occasionally in relation to appointments to the Judiciary. However, if one takes a broad look at the appointments made by the Government since it took office, one could identify people of great eminence &ndash; it would be wrong of me to even attempt to say who they are &ndash; who would not be associated with my party or the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I could take the reverse position and suggest to Deputy Shatter that I could name people who were appointed by Fine Gael Governments who were very much attached to his party. However, I would not insult them by doing so because, as I stated, people who have been appointed to the Judiciary since the foundation of the State have served it extremely well. I wish to take the oppor<Col N="1380" /> tunity during this important debate to acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>However, there is perhaps scope for improvement in the way in which the operation of the judicial appointments board is perceived by the public. Inevitably, there is a degree of confidentiality which has to attach to the board's proceedings. Otherwise its task would be very difficult and, in any event, it would be improper if any assessments which the board may carry out as part of its functions were to be brought into the public domain. There is a balance of rights between the courtesy and confidentiality which individual applicants have a right to expect and the requirements of accountability.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, in the course of developing proposals for inclusion in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, I have been reviewing whether it might be appropriate to introduce certain modifications in respect of aspects of the board's operation. These modifications would be geared towards introducing an element of transparency commensurate with the necessary confidentiality to which I adverted. Any changes which might be introduced on foot of that review will be evident when the Bill is published.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly that it is better to work with the existing structures which have only been in place since 1995 than to introduce new and untested structures which might compromise the integrity of our judicial process. This is not to say that our existing structures are perfect and I have made it clear that I am not averse to introducing modifications which, without jeopardising the integrity to which I referred, will introduce elements of transparency which are not, perhaps, evident at present.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot afford to take risks with our courts system. That system is too important for that and it, therefore, behoves us to move with care. Radicalism has its place, but we cannot afford to be too experimental when it comes to the administration of justice. In this area, a cautious approach is warranted and if the matter were to be progressed any further, it would require very careful debate among the legal professions, the Judiciary and the Courts Service. It is worth recalling that in the related area of examining the options for a code of judicial conduct and ethics, a judicial committee is examining the matter so as to inform political debate on these issues. I shall return to the work of that committee later.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for our courts system, I have to take the long view. Unlike Deputy Shatter, I do not have the luxury of putting forward proposals whose consequences I, or anybody else, cannot even begin to foresee. That is a luxury which goes with being in Opposition, but I must be more considered when it comes to moving forward with proposals which would effect a major and substantial change in the judicial selection process. Even if I conceded that the Deputy's proposal had any merit, it is still the case that any change of the kind mooted could <Col N="1381" /> only be introduced after the widest possible consultation and examination. What is being offered at present is a mere skeleton proposal. The devil is always in the detail and there is an insufficiency of detail in the proposal contained in this Bill such as would make acceptance of it by me an act of impermissible folly.</P>
    <P>It is important that public confidence exists in our judicial system and that includes a confidence that those who are chosen for judicial office are worthy of being chosen. Since the foundation of the State, we have been extremely lucky that men and women of high moral calibre, intellect and principle have been willing to serve as judges in our courts, notwithstanding the fact that in many instances this has meant that the earnings which might otherwise have accrued to them if they had continued in practice as a barrister or solicitor would have been substantially more than they receive as judges.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of judicial office also carries with it certain constraints and exacts a price in terms of an individual's personal life which we do not, perhaps, always acknowledge. As I have said, I am open to the possibility of introducing some modifications which will be of assistance in ensuring that confidence in our judicial system is strengthened. I am not, however, convinced that the proposal contained in section 10 of this Bill would necessarily be instrumental in shoring up that confidence at this time.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is appropriate to refer to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and specifically to the fourth progress report of that committee which dealt with the courts and the Judiciary. That report noted that the role of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is to identify persons, through their own application or the board's invitation, who are suitably qualified for judicial office. In particular, it noted that short listing is on the basis of merit and not political affiliation and that this procedure compares favourably with those in other common law countries because the opportunity has been taken to combine the best features of those systems. The committee also went on to say that the present system of appointing judges should be retained, that the Government has sufficient non-partisan advice from the board and that it, as the Executive of the elected representatives of the people, should retain the final decision. The all-party report also went on to comment:</P>
    <P>It is significant that because the judicial candidates are already short-listed by the Board strictly on merit, the Government cannot be open to the criticism that it appoints only its own supporters rather than suitably qualified persons when it chooses from the list.</P>
    <P>I am considerably fortified by the fact that existing procedures have won the endorsement of a group such as the all-party committee. Such an endorsement would seem to indicate that poli<Col N="1382" /> ticians on all sides of the House have faith in the integrity of existing structures and accept that in this sensitive area we need to work with what we have and not veer off in the direction of more experimental procedures which ultimately might see a more intense politicisation of the judicial appointment process than has ever existed in this State since its foundation.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill before the House contains one final provision at section 11 which I do not propose to deal with in any degree of detail. It is directed solely towards the appointment to office or employment of former holders of judicial office. Among other matters, it would appear to mean that a former judge could not be appointed to chair a tribunal unless that person had first received the prior approval of the committee which is proposed to be established under section 10 of the Bill. That seems to be an unacceptable fetter on the ability of the Executive to conduct its business. It would also be invidious to single out the former holders of judicial office in this way. It suggests that such persons require particular scrutiny and, if one thinks seriously about this, there is an implication here which is profoundly offensive to all who have served honourably both in the past and in the present as dedicated servants of our legal system. There is a broader context to this issue and the approach taken by the Deputy is both narrow in scope and somewhat flawed in terms of method.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fourth progress report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in the context of that committee's consideration of the issue of judicial appointments. That report deals with a much broader range of issues as it deals with the removal of judges, judicial conduct and ethics and questions concerning the judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation and the constitutionality of Bills and laws and related matters. The Government will carefully consider this report in a broad context which recognises the implications it has for all Departments and for public life in general. That consideration will also take place in tandem with the consideration which is being given to the recommendations contained in other reports from the all-party committee.</P>
    <P>As regards the fourth report in particular, I have completed a preliminary examination of its recommendations and I welcome the contribution it has made to an informed debate on matters of fundamental moment. There is considerable public interest in matters connected with the courts and the Judiciary. This reflects well on our democratic tradition and is a mark of the fact that individual citizens feel they have a stake in the way in which our courts do business. They also have a healthy interest in ensuring that the system we have functions in a way which merits their trust and support. As Minister with responsibility for the range of matters addressed by the all-party's <Col N="1383" /> report, I look forward to the challenge which dealing with these matters represents.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not also refer to the judicial committee which was established in April 1999 in response to the sixth report of the working group on a courts commission. That group was established with a broad remit. In particular, it was to advise on and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct, establish a system for the handling of complaints of judicial conduct and other activities such as are taken by similar bodies elsewhere. It was also empowered to consider further the position in other jurisdictions including Canada, New South Wales, the United States of America and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment, the judicial committee has been engaged in consultation with interested bodies and has been faithfully following the remit to which I have just referred. The issues the committee has had to address have been complex but I understand it has almost completed its work and it is hoped its report will be available before the end of this year. I look forward to receiving that report and, in conjunction with the all-party committee's report into related matters, I am sure it will put the Government in a position whereby full consideration can be given to this important matter.</P>

      <P>It would be premature for me to comment at this stage in respect of any recommendations the report might contain. It is only right and proper that I should await the final report before pronouncing in any detail as to the future way forward. Nonetheless, there is probably agreement on all sides of the House and among the Judiciary that some change may be needed. I am aware that there is a view that some body needs to be established which will be able to investigate complaints or concerns voiced about members of the Judiciary. However, it would be wise for me to see what emerges as a result of the analysis of the eminent individuals who are currently engaged in the task of drawing up the report on this matter. I have no doubt but that its final conclusions will make for interesting reading and the Government will not be lacking when it comes to formulating a response to those conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> In recent years, there have been a number of important developments which have impacted upon the way in which our judges are appointed and in which our courts go about their business. The establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was an important step in introducing a degree of transparency into the judicial appointment process. The more recent establishment of the Courts Service is indicative of a modern and progressive approach to the management of our courts &ndash; an approach which ensures that our courts will be well equipped to confront the challenges of the 21st century. Attention has now begun to focus on how we might develop further the structures which have already been put in place and on how we can ensure that the confidence which has always existed in our judicial system is strengthened and enhanced.</P>
    <P>I hope the debate we are having here this evening is not counterproductive in terms of the impact it may have on members of the public who will undoubtedly be exposed to negative and damaging comments from members of the Opposition. It should be remembered that Governments of all parties since the foundation of the State have had a role in shaping the judicial appointments system. If there are to be changes in that system, they should be introduced on the basis of consensus and general agreement.</P>
    <P>An independent Judiciary is a precious commodity. We have been lucky to date in the calibre of those who have been appointed to serve as judges and, as the all-party committee has noted, there is no evidence that those appointed in the past have displayed favouritism to the party that appointed them. Any such suggestion would be insulting in the extreme. If we are to have changes in the appointments process we must be sure those changes are worthwhile and that there is a demonstrable value to be gained in making them. While it may have some imperfections, our current system has worked well in practice and we should be slow to interfere too dramatically with that system now.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said earlier concerning the Government's openness to widening the pool of eligibility for appointment to the Superior Courts. However, the Bill before this House is limited in scope and it has certain flaws which will be apparent when the Government Bill is published later this session. I have no doubt that many of the issues which surface in this evening's debate will fall to be debated yet again and I look forward to that debate with considerable anticipation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this first legislative measure introduced by the relatively new Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Shatter, who has a distinguished record of producing Private Members' legislation which subsequently made it onto the Statute Book. I fear that in his new portfolio his legislative record in Opposition might not fare as well as the Minister who is now departing the House for what is I am sure another <Col N="1385" /> important engagement. In not untypical language, he said that acceptance of Deputy Shatter's Bill would be an act of impermissible folly. Even the language is typical of the Minister. The attitude is certainly typical of the Minister who often vaunted the generosity of the previous Administration and characterised it as somehow an achievement of his that good and sensible suggestions emanating from the Opposition benches were taken, accepted and teased out, often with significant amendment, in committee. I fear that no matter how meritorious proposals come from this side of the House, they will not be met with favour by the current incumbent in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Any act from this side of the House is perceived by him as an impermissible folly.</P>
      <P>I want to address the contents of this important measure and deal with it as constructively as possible. The Bill presented to the House addresses one aspect of a much larger issue which deserves careful and systematic consideration. The wider context is the interaction between the branches of the legal profession and the extent to which that interaction serves the common good. I am always aware that when I approach legal issues in this House I do so as an untrained layman, a mere servant of the people of Wexford, whereas many who address this House are trained lawyers, but I hope I do it with a layman's and a common-sense perspective.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us deals with one manifestation of the distinction between the two branches of the law, that is, qualification for appointment to the superior courts in this land. It is not necessary, for the purposes of this debate, to attempt to justify or even understand the present division of the legal profession into two branches. There is no doubt in my mind that no one starting with a blank sheet of paper would come up now with anything approaching the existing divided system, with different entry requirements, training modules, methods of practice and disciplinary regimes.</P>
      <P>There will always be trial lawyers who specialise in advocacy, advising and arguing from time to time on litigation, as opposed to the rest of the profession whose job is to keep themselves and their clients as far away from the courts as possible. United legal professions produce such specialists but there is a lot to be said for the view that if any such specialisation should occur at a later stage in the career of lawyers who have had common entry and training, it would be a good thing. There is a lot to be said for the argument that the current arrangement here results, where litigation arises, in unnecessary over-manning, duplication and expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One beneficial effect of the present system claimed for the Bar is that its members, by and large, are not tied economically to the interests of one particular client base. The argument is that practitioners who take on clients on a case by case basis conserve a wide catchment of clients and have a more dispassionate viewpoint which places <Col N="1386" /> greater stress on maintaining the overall system from which they earn their livelihood, rather than the interests of any one client or sector. Being tied to the <i>status quo</i> is all the more attractive, however, when one can claim the public interest is best served by a system which also serves one very well financially.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the justification for the Bar, to the extent that there continues to be one, will have to be the sourcing, by office bound solicitors, of specialist expertise from off-site independent contractors, who are barristers. The argument is that the process where solicitors buy in the best independent experts to serve a client is efficient and is bound to produce the best results. Major law firms will continuously reassess the extent to which they can provide such in-house services from their own resources and also to the extent to which sole traders, that is, barristers have the resources behind them to guarantee the same quality of service.</P>
    <P>As regards smaller solicitors' firms, there must be a real question as to whether a practice of off-loading responsibility for many aspects of their workload involving litigation to a barrister entitles them to charge for their services in any cases that arise subsequently on anything other than the basis of secretarial and postal expenses. It may be that there should be a trend towards the development of the legal equivalent of the chain store, nationwide partnerships operating in towns around the country so that smaller populations could be better served by economies of scale and by access to centralised resources and expertise. The exigencies of the rules of effective competition might demand a review of our partnership law to encourage such a result. Under current rules, barristers may not act as partners.</P>
    <P>I make these general points as a layman's introduction to the division of the legal system and the way it serves the public, which is increasingly a matter that is exercising the public mind. I set it out in the context in which we should consider this measure before us.</P>
    <P>At present appointment to the High Court and the Supreme Court is largely confined to persons who, at the time of nomination, are practising barristers of 12 years standing, and Circuit Court judges, whether formally practising as barristers or solicitors, of four years standing as judges. Solicitors can make their way to the superior courts if they are introduced through the Circuit Court. The argument for retention of the <i>status quo</i> is that even those who wish to see radical changes in the criteria for appointment are prepared to accept that, by and large, there is generally a high quality of judges in the superior courts. That is a fact. Not many people would argue that we have been well served by extremely competent, able and discerning superior court judges.</P>
    <P>The working group on this question summarised the position of the Bar Council. The argument for any change to the present situation must be not that the present system is bad but that any improved system, such as the one being examined <Col N="1387" /> tonight in this House, would be better. In respect of about two or so superior court vacancies that arise annually, about 150 senior counsel who have been in practice for more than 12 years fall to be considered. The solicitors' branch, by contrast, would run into thousands. There is an argument to be made, therefore, that simply widening the criteria for eligibility without other changes being made would have the effect of increasing rather than reducing political influence and personal favouritism in judicial appointments. If far more people possess the basic qualifications, there is all the more possibility for Government to apply the Lemass dictum to the effect that, all other things being equal and if there are thousands suitably qualified, the job should go to the party man. In other words, if a great number of people are made eligible for appointment while retaining the appointment power in the same hands, the net effect is to greatly increase the discretion of those to whom one gives the power to appoint. Widening the pool of available talent only provides great opportunity to pick and choose according to the personal preference of the the person who makes the choice.</P>
    <P>Because Deputy Shatter's Bill is confined largely to the judicial appointments procedure and does not seek to address the wider issue of the disjointed nature of the structure of the legal profession, there are very few people to whom it would or ought to apply. As Deputy Shatter said, solicitors have been entitled to act as advocates in the superior courts since 1971. It is not only conventional politeness that requires me to recognise that Deputy Shatter has ably availed of the opportunity provided by that legislative change and by all accounts, although I have not witnessed him in action, has done it very well. He is one of a mere handful of solicitors who have attempted over the past 30 years to carve out a career as an advocate in the superior courts, although the legislative ability to do that is available, and the Deputy has been most successful in that attempt.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in asserting the Deputy's qualifications for high judicial appointment. I would, however, query from the track record whether many of his colleagues would join him in that qualification. Deputy Shatter recognises the difficulty and provides in his Bill that eligibility for appointment should be confined to what he classes as &ldquo;litigation solicitors&rdquo;. That point was also taken up by the Minister. It is difficult to define who is a litigation solicitor and how that should be determined. Under the Bill the question of who is or who is not a litigation solicitor is to be determined by a certificate issued by the President of the Law Society to that effect.</P>
    <P>Two issues arise here. The first relates to the new section 5(2)(<i>c</i>) of the 1961 Act, provided for in section 3 of Deputy Shatter's Bill, which provides that a certificate to that effect by the President of the Law Society shall be conclusive evidence that a person is a litigation solicitor. I am <Col N="1388" /> advised by my eminent legal advisers that there must be a question as to the constitutional validity of a provision that a matter of evidence should be determined by conclusive certificate rather than on facts as found by a court. On the face of it, this appears to fall foul of the decision of the Supreme Court in Mahon <i>v .</i> Attorney General, on the grounds that its operation would constitute interference with the administration of justice. However, it may be that, although drafted in the way it is, it might not be construed as a rule of evidence but as a preliminary step in the qualification procedure.</P>
    <P>The second question is how the President of the Law Society should judge which of his colleagues should be so classified. What does the phrase mean? They are all solicitors of the High Court and entitled to practice in any court in the land. Does the expression mean they are available to practice in the superior courts, that they do so on occasion or that they do so regularly or exclusively? Under the present rules, a barrister is classified as practising if he or she, &ldquo;on the hazard&rdquo;, is available for work. It is a separate question as to whether any work is given to them. A barrister may be of 12 years standing but might not have been very active for that 12 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>By analogy, is a litigation solicitor someone who would not refuse a High Court case if offered it at one extreme or, at the other extreme, someone who would refuse work that did not fall into the category of advocacy before the superior courts.</P>
      <P>If we are to widen the criteria for eligibility for appointment, which I and the Labour Party support, we need to be clear on the criteria we define and it is a matter to which the Minister alluded.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the criteria the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board should bring to bear in assessing applications for judicial appointment once this preliminary hurdle has been passed. The board should consider whether the applicant has displayed by his or her practice a significant knowledge and experience of the decisions, practices and procedures of the High Court and Supreme Court. It seems we are returning to the basic question, how do we do it? How do we demonstrate significant knowledge and experience of decisions, practices and procedures, which, in many instances, would be difficult for people who do not give advocacy in the courts? I am sure we can tease out that point on Committee Stage, if the Bill reaches that Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advisory board does not engage in a widespread practice of consultation and peer review in respect of the names appearing before it. Perhaps it should so that the collective wisdom of the <Col N="1389" /> profession could be applied. Until it does so, only the personal knowledge of the members of the advisory board is relevant or comes into play. How is the President of the High Court to assess the extent, if any, of the knowledge of a solicitor who appears regularly before him. sitting in the court but not making advocacy on behalf of a client?</P>
    <P>Our position is that the Bill is welcome. It opens a debate on how to broaden the criteria for eligibility. It also opens debate on other wider issues that are important in the context of the demand for greater transparency in public administration.</P>
    <P>I am not certain whether Article 30 of the Constitution could be interpreted as allowing the position of Attorney General to be confined to members of the Bar or even that any legal qualification, academic or professional could be lawfully specified. Professor John Kelly was a non-practising barrister on appointment as Attorney General, yet by virtue of his appointment he became leader of the Bar.</P>
    <P>At present the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides in section 16(6) that in advising the President on the appointment of a person to a judicial office, the Government shall first consider for appointment those persons whose names have been recommended to the Minister by the advisory board. Whether it would be constitutionally feasible to fetter a discretion as to the appointment conferred on the Executive, as the Minister voiced, by requiring it, once it has made its nomination, to take a further interim step of having it vetted by a committee of the House is one we need to address. It is a proposal I strongly support.</P>
    <P>The current requirement that the board should forward at least seven names to the Minister for consideration needs to be tightened up, given that a name once forwarded remains on the table for all future vacancies unless it is specifically removed by the nominee and any further vacancy requires a further seven nominees, which means that at any given stage there is a broad pool of recommended personages before the committee.</P>

      <P>Today's report from the Higher Education Authority points to a clear conclusion &ndash; access to third level education and university in particular is highly dependent on access to financial support, be that from parents or from local authorities. Today's report underlines two major requirements for third level reform to ensure equality of access for students from all social and economic backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first requirement relates to reform of the restrictive means test for third level grants which <Col N="1390" /> discriminates against PAYE workers. The second requirement relates to the major gaps in support for students in disadvantaged areas. Access to a third level grant is often the criterion on which a student is forced either to reject or accept the offer of a university place. It is clear to me from my constituents that some families are not qualifying for grants despite the fact that they are struggling to meet high mortgage, transport and child care costs. The rising rate of inflation has compounded their difficulties in meeting day to day costs.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority report states that 25% of higher education grants go to the children of large farmers and this highlights the need to reform the means test for the grant in favour of the PAYE worker. When former Labour Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach was Minister for Education she abolished third level fees to level the playing field for the children of PAYE workers. However, today's report suggests we need to go further to reform the means test to take account of the growing burden of transport and mortgage costs on workers.</P>
    <P>In this respect there may be good reason to review the means test guidelines to relate to the net rather than gross income of parents to qualify for the grant. I hope the Minister of State addresses this in his reply. What is the status of the Minister's plan to establish a new agency to oversee grants? I understand he has announced plans for a central agency to administer grants which would, in future, be means tested by the Revenue Commissioners and allocated through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>Apart from the means test, the report also contains other interesting findings. The report highlights the need to improve supports for disadvantaged students at pre-school, primary and second levels. One of the report's most salient findings is that among students with similarly low results, those from a professional background have a much better chance of progressing to third level in comparison with students from an unskilled background. This highlights a crucial failure at all levels of the education system to ensure ongoing access to career guidance for disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>Other factors also contribute to low participation rates among disadvantaged students at third level. Last month the Labour Party produced a research document on the cost of sending a child to school which revealed that most schools rely heavily on so-called voluntary contributions to meet their running costs. Schools in disadvantaged areas are not in a position to get these contributions from parents and, therefore, they cannot ensure the same standard of education as more affluent schools. Surely this inequality has a bearing on low-income students' progression to third level.</P>
    <P>Another area of education which could act as an insurance policy against early school leaving and which could improve the prospects of pro<Col N="1391" /> gression to third level is pre-school education for disadvantaged students. This area has been completely neglected by this Administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education and Science. I am pleased to respond to the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase the rates of third level maintenance grants annually in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. Last June, in line with this policy, the Minister for Education and Science announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant and 5% in the qualifying income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to February. The increase of 5% in grants for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund of £95 million over the period of the plan which is aimed at tackling under-representation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise him on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. He has asked the group to provide a report to him within three months.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and purely as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, the Minister for Education and Science has announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders and which is targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant are as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. It is expected that some 10,000 students will benefit from this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report published today by the Higher Education Authority, Social Background of Higher <Col N="1392" /> Education Entrants, will, of course, inform the work of the action group.</P>

      <P>We have all looked with a mixture of amazement, admiration and, I am sure, apprehension at the stunning recent advances in genetic engineering, biotechnology and related sciences. To the ordinary man in the street it is almost impossible to keep abreast of the developments, not to mention the associated scientific vocabulary.</P>
      <P>With the hype surrounding the cloning of Dolly the sheep, followed swiftly by the birth of Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom &ndash; the five cloned banbhs born this year, four of which were named after pioneering surgeons in the transplant technology area &ndash; it is easy to forget this technology has been around for many years, albeit not in quite as advanced a form. The first animal to be cloned was a frog in the 1960s in Oxford University.</P>
      <P>Allied to cloning technology, we have cracked the code of the human genome. What does this mean? Who, other than those scientists at the coalface of innovation and the large multinationals financing research in the area, is capable of telling us, in layman's language, where this is leading? More importantly, what are the legal, moral and ethical parameters within which this industry and research should operate? It appears to me that there are no such parameters. There is certainly no effective legal framework, which is surely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I bring to the attention of the House the comments of Asim Sheikh, a lecturer in legal medicine at University College Dublin and a practising barrister, who was quoted in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week as saying there is no legislation to guide us. That is why we need a public debate and, subsequently, to gain approval for the direction in which this industry is taking us and a legal framework.</P>
      <P>The birth on 29 September last of Adam Nash in Colorado, USA, is undeniably a source of great pride and relief to his parents. Apart from the gift of a son, it appears that this child has also saved his sister's life. Serious questions arise from Adam Nash's birth. It is obviously difficult in the circumstances to argue from the particular to the general, but nonetheless the following and other questions arise. How large a leap of science, public demand or public opinion is the issue of designer babies who are tall, blond, blue eyed and who have a high IQ? Is conception acceptable when solely for the purpose of harvesting spare parts, human genes, organs or cells? What are the psychological, emotional and other consequences for these children later in life? I am sure none of us can answer these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is high time the Legislature caught up with the laboratory. Voluntary codes of ethics are no longer acceptable. Public debate on all these issues is necessary, followed by legislation at <Col N="1393" /> national, EU and global levels. Raising this issue should not be seen in any quarter as an attack on knowledge, research or science &ndash; far from it. I am calling for a clear legal framework for the industry and for broad public approval for the future direction it takes.</P>

      <P>I again apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I thank Deputy Creed for raising this important issue. The Minister shares his concern about the need to ensure that the bioengineering industry is regulated in an appropriate manner. There is no doubt that we are living in an era characterised by an ever-increasing pace of scientific and technological developments. In particular, we are witnessing ongoing and major advances in the capacity of science to intervene in the process of human reproduction. The birth of Adam Nash and the circumstances surrounding his birth comprise just one example of such intervention. The potential of science to control or even alter the natural process of the creation of human life raises basic and fundamental ethical questions for the medical profession, Government and society.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that many countries have introduced legislation in recent years to set down parameters and establish frameworks of control within which such interventions and procedures can take place, while acknowledging that scientific development can often outpace the legislative controls. The position in Ireland is that this activity is not subject to statutory control. Medical practice is governed by Medical Council guidelines. These apply only in the case of registered medical practitioners and would be ineffective in the case of any service operated by other persons. The pace of new developments and the possibility of the entry of less scrupulous interests into this field raises questions about how best it should be regulated.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware of the growing concern among the public about the practice of complex and controversial procedures in this country in the absence of any legislative controls. He acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Deputy in this regard and I assure him that the Minister is committed to ensuring that the concerns are addressed. In addressing the concerns, he is anxious to ensure that our approach is one which is informed and takes into account the wide range of sensitive and complex issues which surround the area of assisted human reproduction which have legal, ethical, social and medical implications.</P>
      <P>For this reason the Government agreed to the establishment of a Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction earlier this year. The terms of reference of the commission are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>. . . to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into <Col N="1394" /> account in determining public policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the commission represents the essential first step of a process aimed at bringing forward policy proposals for this area. The commission, which is chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, comprises the medical. scientific and legal expertise necessary for a detailed and informed examination of the possible approaches to regulation of the area. The commission will be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriately to establish the views of service providers and consumers as well as establishing adoption issues involved. The commission will also be required to consult with philosophical and theological experts to ensure that their perspectives are considered and reflected as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Among the core issues which the commission will need to examine are whether regulation is best achieved by legislation or reliance on medical ethics or a combination of the two; the replacement, freezing and subsequent usage or disposal of embryos; the freezing and subsequent usage or disposal of sperm; the regulation of who may use the services, for example, the age and marital status of couples; the regulation of donor programmes, surrogacy, legal parentage. succession rights, registration of births, etc.; possible screening of embryos for genetic conditions; research on embryos; and cloning. Issues such as licensing of facilities, qualifications of staff, conditions of storage of embryos and other human reproductive material, optimum number of treatments in an individual case, testing for infectious diseases, record keeping and data collection will also need to be considered. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals. I again thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending and I am pleased he recognises the importance of this issue. It is with great sadness that I find myself speaking yet again on the lack of taxis and of public transport generally. I speak against a background where two families in my constituency have got the call in the middle of the night that every parent dreads, informing them that their sons have been killed on the streets of their capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more than sad. I am outraged that this is happening to our children and that, despite all our prosperity and success and the Celtic tiger of which we speak, the State is not offering protec<Col N="1395" /> tion to our children and cannot provide them with a public transport system. This outrage is felt by every parent in Dublin. There is a deep and palpable sense of anger that the Government is unwilling or unable to recognise or come to grips with providing something even as straightforward and as basic as a taxi service for the capital city.</P>
    <P>The public is asking what it takes to get the Government to focus on the transport problem for any longer than it takes to hold a press conference to announce yet another transport plan. These are plans that do not and cannot go anywhere because they are cancelled and replaced within a few months. People ask what level of daytime congestion it takes for the Government to take notice of what is happening to Dublin and Dubliners and to their quality of life. They also ask what level of night-time violence and how many distraught families, broken teeth and traumatised young people it takes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has not listened to me in the past but if he will not listen to me now, will he listen to the concerns of the public expressed with the type of fury, frustration and anger that I have never witnessed before?</P>
    <P>The relevant Ministers with responsibility for transport must be receiving the same angry calls I have received, must be reading the newspapers, must see the campaigns being launched &ndash; I refer to that run by the <i>Evening Herald</i>&ndash; and must have listened to radio 'phone-ins.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot back away from claiming responsibility and state that there are no short-term solutions. There are short-term solutions which can and must be implemented. When I first raised the need for increased taxi numbers some years ago, the Taoiseach's contribution was to postpone any increase for almost a year while he established a forum to obtain a consensus in the taxi industry. Whose interests was he serving, those of the industry or those of the public?</P>
    <P>When we finally circumvented that barrier and began issuing a few new licences the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, blundered in with an extraordinary quick-fix gimmick which, had he bothered to consult anyone who had examined the workings of the industry, he would have been told was doomed to failure. Far from doubling the number of taxis, he succeeded in stopping any new plates being issued and did nothing for 12 months as if this matter, which continues to wind its way through the courts, was of little consequence to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister of State to do whatever it takes to extricate himself from this cul de sac of legal action he has created. It is for him to decide whether that requires returning to the planned phased release of licences or withdrawing all existing licences and wiping the slate clean, compensating licence holders and starting afresh with a more rational system. However, it is certain that he cannot continue to behave as if <Col N="1396" /> he was helpless and as if all of this had nothing to do with him.</P>
    <P>Neither more taxis nor more buses will end violence on our streets, but they might save somebody's son or daughter. Where are the buses? Why is the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, absent? Has she no sense of the anger and outrage that is abroad at present? Why has she not placed an advertisement in today's newspapers seeking tenders for late night services?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State has gained some sense of the anger I feel. That anger is felt by parents who are annoyed by the Government's ineptitude and its apparent indifference. These people want action on transport and safer streets for our children.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>David Keating is the third young man to die on the streets of Dublin within six weeks as a result of a violent attack. Dublin streets late at night, into the small hours of the morning, have become a war zone in which the lives of those who walk through them are at risk. Gratuitous violence seems to have become the rule rather than the exception.</P>
      <P>The Keating family is the second family in my constituency, which is also that of Deputy Olivia Mitchell, to suffer the mind-numbing bereavement of having a young son killed on the streets of Dublin. A few short weeks ago, Brian Murphy lost his life outside the Burlington Hotel. Young people are entitled to enjoy a social life in Dublin and doing so should not place their lives at risk.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that David Keating and his friends were forced to walk because of a scarcity of taxis and the inadequacy of our public transport system. It is clear, that far too many young people returning late at night from social events in Dublin have no choice but to walk home in the small hours of the morning. Tragically, it is also clear that the Government has failed totally to come to grips with the unacceptable level of violence on the streets of Dublin and to take the action necessary to make our streets safe. It is the nightmare of every parent in Dublin that their son or daughter could be the next victim.</P>
      <P>I support the call of my constituency colleague, Deputy Mitchell, for the Government, once and for all, to tackle effectively the scandalous shortage of taxis and also to ensure that we have a much improved public transport service for young people returning late at night from social events in the city centre. I also call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to guarantee a far greater and more visible Garda presence on our streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> Everyone on this side of the House shares the outrage to which Deputy Mitchell referred. It is outrageous, scandalous and disgraceful that three young men have lost their lives in Dublin city when returning home from social events on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday evening. It is unacceptable that the Government is finding it utterly impossible to put in place effective transport systems and to provide Garda patrols in order to guarantee that young people can travel home safely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue tonight. The availability of late night transport in Dublin is a matter of concern for the Government. It is clear that taxis form only one part &ndash; albeit the most flexible part &ndash; of the overall public transport system in Dublin. I will deal with the taxi issue in a moment but I must first state that over the next few weeks, Bus Átha Cliath will announce plans for an enhanced late night service which will be introduced before Christmas and will continue into the New Year. It is also intended to provide late night DART services on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights for three weeks before Christmas. with the last DART departing the city centre at 1.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>The revised Action Programme for the Millennium, published in November 1999, made an explicit commitment to improving the Dublin taxi service through the introduction of measures to increase the number of taxi licences in Dublin in order to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market. While acknowledging improvements in the Dublin taxi services brought about by the Dublin local authorities, with some 750 additional wheelchair accessible taxi licences issued between 1997 and the end of 1999, the Government held the view that a more accelerated approach to matching supply and demand was needed, particularly in the fight of current strong economic growth.</P>
      <P>On 30 November 1999 the Government decided to provide for the early grant of a substantial number of new taxi licences in the Dublin taximeter area, to be apportioned as follows, one new taxi licence would be offered to each individual who held a taxi licence in Dublin at the end of 1999 &ndash; it was estimated at that stage that there were approximately 2,600 such individuals &ndash; and 500 of these new licences would be granted in respect of wheelchair accessible taxis, and 500 additional taxi licences would be granted to applicants under the current points assessment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations were made on 13 January 2000 which temporarily assign the determination of new taxi numbers in the Dublin taximeter area to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and triggered the process whereby all existing licence holders in the Dublin area, known as &ldquo;qualified persons&rdquo;, could apply for the grant of either a taxi or a wheelchair accessible <Col N="1398" /> taxi licence from Dublin Corporation. Fees for the taxi licences were set at £2,500 in the case of ordinary taxi licences and £250 in the case of wheelchair accessible taxi licences.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the regulations, individual notices were issued by Dublin Corporation to each licence holder inviting them to apply for either an ordinary taxi licence or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence and over 2,600 applications were received by the corporation by the closing date of 18 February 2000. The regulations provided for the making of an offer to grant a wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each licence holder who expressed a preference for the grant of such a licence and who complies with the requirements of the regulations. The remaining licences, including those to be offered to applicants under the current assessment system, were to be allocated in accordance with a scheme which has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>The intention had been that the majority of the taxi licences under the Government initiative would be granted in 2000 to provide a speedy improvement in the level of service to the public. In the event, Deputies will be aware that High Court judicial review proceedings were initiated on 7 February 2000 by a number of individuals in relation to the Government decision and a range of provisions contained in the public service vehicle regulations. The court also granted an interim injunction preventing Dublin Corporation from granting taxi licences pursuant to the regulations pending the determination of the application for judicial review. The matter was heard in the High Court over a period of days between 21 March and 24 May 2000 and further implementation of the Government decision must await the outcome of the court proceedings. In this regard a judgment is expected on Friday next. Members will appreciate that ministerial intervention at this point would not be appropriate.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> Táim an-bhíoch gur tugadh deis dom an fhadhb seo a phlé anseo anocht.</P>
      <P>I must express my disappointment that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, for the third time this evening, is representing the Minister to whose Department a matter applies. However, I accept that Ministers are very busy. Under the system we use for matters taken on the Adjournment, the Minister of State will have in his possession a script written by a civil servant this afternoon. I hope I am a Member of the Dáil when this sytem is changed and a more realistic one put in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the absence of a full-time solicitor in the Carlow legal aid centre. There is no legal aid service in Carlow. The county is linked with Kilkenny and while that forms a very successful political unit it is not successful with regard to <Col N="1399" /> legal aid. We are visited by an overworked solicitor from Kilkenny twice every month &ndash; not once a week but two days every month. That is classed as a legal aid service.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister of State's script will compare this with similar delays in other parts of the country and claim that Carlow is no worse than other places. Were it not for the fact that five solicitors give their time freely and free of charge to help people who need legal advice the queue would be three or four times longer. Furthermore, when people who need legal aid discover that a solicitor visits the centre only twice a month they somehow manage to consult a solicitor privately. There is no service in Carlow. The delay is minimised only for the reasons I have just given.</P>
    <P>Despite the lack of service the centre had 333 queries between January and July 2000. During all of 1999 there were 400. The number of queries is rising. This may be explained by the fact that Carlow is the fastest growing centre of population outside Dublin as was shown in a recent engineers' association report. A fast growing centre of population will always have problems.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State's script includes a definite commitment to provide a legal aid service to Carlow. This means providing a full-time solicitor. A visit by a solicitor twice a month is not a service. I look forward with hope to the Minister of State's reply.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who could not be here tonight, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to update the House in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>Under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided is solely a matter for the Legal Aid Board. Its responsibility in this regard includes decisions in relation to the location of law centres. The Legal Aid Board already operates a part-time law centre in Carlow. This centre provides services on the first and third Fridays of every month and is located in St. Catherine's social services centre. The centre is operated by the staff of the law centre in Kilkenny, which includes two solicitors.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Legal Aid Board that at the end of September the numbers of persons on the waiting lists in Carlow and Kilkenny were 70 and 81, respectively, while the numbers of applications for legal services at Carlow and Kilkenny during the period 1997 to date were 551 and 933, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to those applicants waiting for legal <Col N="1400" /> services, the Legal Aid Board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded to certain categories of cases over others, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are time limits. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the problems being experienced in relation to waiting times in law centres the Minster made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board this year when he increased the allocation of grant-in-aid to £12.899 million. This represents an increase of 8% on the 1999 allocation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the board operates a private practitioner scheme and this was launched on a nationwide basis earlier this year. This scheme will assist the board in its efforts to provide a service to all applicants within a reasonable period. It provides a complementary legal service to that provided from law centres, particularly for certain family law matters in the District Court, namely, domestic violence, maintenance and custody/ access.</P>
    <P>Private practitioners are used in cases of geographical remoteness, conflict of interest cases and in cases where the exigencies of the law centre service so require. Applicants are given the option of either going to a private solicitor of their choice from the panel of private practitioners or having their names added to the waiting list at the law centre. This scheme, while increasing the services provided by the board, should also enable law centres to devote more resources to non-District Court matters and should help to reduce waiting times in law centes, including the Carlow part-time centre.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand from the Legal Aid Board that a review of practices and procedures in law centres is being undertaken to seek to improve efficiency. The board considers that this review, together with the extension of the private practitioners scheme, will lead to an increase in the throughput of cases and the provision of services to a greater number of persons. Where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the board that it is reviewing the allocation of the additional staff resources obtained for the board earlier this year and the respective needs of the different law centres will be considered so that the board can maximise the use of resources made available to it. In this regard the possibility of assigning an additional solicitor to Kilkenny, from where the services to Carlow is provided, will be kept under active review.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 11 October 2000.</P>

      <b>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation </b>
    </P>
    <P>(Dr. McDaid): I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 36, 38 and 47 together.</P>
    <P>My Department has not received any application for financial assistance from the FAI for the Eircom Park project. The FAI made separate presentations of their stadium proposal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and to myself, prior to the public launch of their project. Since the presentation made to me by the FAI on 19 February 1999, I did not have a formal meeting with the FAI. The Taoiseach met with representatives of the FAI to discuss the Eircom Park on 6 March last.</P>
    <P>In the course of each of these presentations, the FAI representatives were at pains to make it clear to the Government that their project would be self-financing and not reliant on any external grant aid.</P>
    <P>This was subsequently confirmed in the documentation that accompanied the public launch of the arena project. The FAI did state that it had longer term plans for the construction of a national youth coaching and development centre and said that it was likely that it would be seeking Government support for that project. Consequently, the matter of support or any special allocation, for the FAI stadium, does not arise.</P>
    <P>The House will be well aware that the Government's clearly expressed, and repeated, wish is that the FAI come on board the Stadium Ireland project. It has already been indicated to the FAI that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; estimates that revenue in the region of £40 million could be generated for the FAI through ticket sales alone. In addition, of course, the FAI would not be faced with any capital debt repayments or infrastructural costs.</P>
    <P>In my view the FAI could do excellent work by distributing this £40 million to club and youth soccer facilities and training right across the country. The FAI would, in that situation, have full use of the national stadium without cost to them until matches come to be played and would be able to assist the development of soccer in this country on an unprecedented scale.</P>
    <P>The Government's announcement of Sports Campus Ireland is part of an overall strategy to allow individual sports associations to concentrate on developing and investing in their own sports at all levels.</P>
    <P>I have had no discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, regarding Eircom Park.</P>

      <P>Of this allocation, £12.5 million has been advanced so far this year to Area Development Management Limited to meet expenditure incurred in the local action plans of the partnerships and community groups.

      <P>Regarding the new action plans for 2000-06, work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of new plans by the local drugs task forces under the national drugs strategy and also by the local partnerships, both of which form part of the NDP's social inclusion programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 48, 228 and 229 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial funding continues to be provided by my Department to support the development <Col N="1405" /> of athletics in Ireland. The increase in sports funding from £13.5 million in 1997, when this Government took office, to the all-time high of over £51 million this year, has ensured very considerable improvements in the quality and extent of the facilities and services available to all sports in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Capital funding for the provision of sport and recreational facilities has increased by over 350% since I took office. The sport of athletics has benefited in a very significant way under my Department's sports capital programme in the recent few years.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Deputy will be aware, I announced the allocation of a grant of £4.8 million towards the provision of a new state of the art indoor athletics facility for Morton Stadium, Santry. This major new facility will be a boon to the training, coaching and competitive needs of Irish track and field athletes. It will also provide new administrative headquarters for the newly unified governing body of Irish athletics.</P>
    <P>In addition, substantial grants have been made towards the upgrading, refurbishment and provision of athletics facilities in Cork, Galway, Navan, Castleisland and Nenagh.</P>
    <P>Under the sports capital programme, nearly 700 clubs and organisations were allocated grants amounting to £36 million this year. This is helping to ensure that we have a network of good quality facilities around the country to meet the needs of a wide number of sports and disciplines. The planned facilities at Stadium and Campus Ireland will add to the greatly enhanced range of sophisticated, high quality facilities available in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment on a statutory basis with effect from 1 July 1999, the Irish Sports Council supports Irish athletics through a range of programmes, including its annual grant scheme for administration, coaching and competition and organisation development and its international carding scheme. The question of the allocation of funds under these programmes is a matter for the council.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any study which compares the range of facilities available here with those in other EU countries or other jurisdictions. I am satisfied, however, that there is now under way an ambitious programme of state assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

Each beneficiary is responsible for the design of the project which requires the approval of our technical advisers prior to commencement of work on the project.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte does not yet have information available on the most visited tourist attractions in 1999. However, according to the results of Bord Fáilte's 1998 survey of main tourist attractions, both fee paying and non fee paying, the following were the most visited: National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin Zoo, Book of Kells, Guinness Hopstore, Hugh Lane Gallery, Bunratty Castle, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Waterford Crystal, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rock of Cashel.</P>
      <P>Ireland is fortunate to have a number of world class visitor attractions. However, I am conscious that many of these major attractions are situated in the capital city, a situation similar to that pertaining in other countries.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address regional spread of tourism product, the Government has earmarked £100 million under the national development plan for tourism product development measures, under the regional operational programmes.</P>
      <P>In the drafting of these measures, I have sought to ensure that their focus is to develop the tourism product in an environmental and sustainable way, that widens the spatial spread of tourism and diverts pressure from highly developed areas.</P>
      <P>The strategy is to concentrate support on a series of special interest activities to meet identified niche markets; on a limited number of new visitor attractions, capable of attracting a significant number of visitors to developing tourism areas; and on the creation of coherent and marketable clusters of existing attractions and facilities, which have yet to achieve their full tourism potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be well aware that Irish tourism growth over the past ten years has been unprecedented, with visitor numbers to Ireland doubling to 5.9 million and foreign exchange earnings rising to £2.5 billion in 1999. All regions have shared in this growth, but there have been variations in performance &ndash; due, in no small measure, to international industry trends such as the growth in short breaks and urban tourism.</P>
      <P>The importance of regional spread is clearly reflected in the tourism strategy outlined in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 which provides, under my aegis, some £350 million for tourism marketing, training and product development.</P>
      <P>Within this overall budget, some £100 million has been earmarked for tourism product development measures, under the regional operational programmes. In the drafting of these measures, I have sought to ensure that their focus is to develop the tourism product in an environmental and sustainable way, that widens the spatial spread of tourism and diverts pressure from highly developed areas.</P>
      <P>The strategy is to concentrate support on a series of special interest activities to meet identified niche markets; on a limited number of new visitor attractions; and on creating coherent and marketable clusters of existing attractions and facilities which have yet to achieve their full tourism potential.</P>
      <P>One of the intended impacts of this approach is that there will be a more balanced spatial spread of tourism and that, in more congested areas, environmental pressure will be reduced.</P>
      <P>It is the visitor's prerogative as to where he or she spends a holiday.</P>
      <P>Many factors influence that decision. Bord Fáilte's destination marketing programme seeks to influence visitors to come to Ireland first and foremost. This programme is complemented by the activities of the regional tourism authorities, and the industry itself, in promoting their respective regions and products. These activities include those supported by the special regional tourism marketing initiative which in 2000, will provide some £940,000 for the six regional tourism authorities and Shannon Development.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte compiles regular seasonal reports drawn from a variety of sources, including passenger statistics, Bord Fáilte's own visitor surveys and reports from the various sectors within the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The most recent such report, covering the first six months of this year, confirms the continuing growth of the Irish tourism industry, indicating that visitor numbers for the period are in line with Bord Fáilte's overall annual target for growth of 6%. The majority of accommodation sectors such as hotels, guesthouses and self-catering, have reported increased occupancy levels for the period concernd.</P>
      <P>I am aware of reports indicating a slight downturn in the level of business enjoyed by the bed and breakfast sector. However, it is also reported that while casual, passing trade has declined, demand through trade channels is growing. According to the Bord Fáilte report, industry sources have indicated that the main factors influencing this downturn include a general shift in the preference of domestic and international markets towards the additional facilities offered by hotels and a preference to be located nearer towns and cities.</P>
      <P>Last year, I launched a pilot initiative targeted primarily at the small accommodation provider, whereby Bord Fáilte would carry out a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category are branded and marketed overseas with a view to increasing business overall and particularly in off-peak season and in rural areas.</P>
      <P>£300,000 was set aside for this initiative in 1999 and a further £500,000 this year. The initiative involved supporting a range of practical promotional activities on behalf of the bed and breakfast sector, including attendance at trade fairs, advertising, off-season promotion with tour operators, in addition to organising a series of educational workshops for individual operators.</P>
      <P>Since April of this year, Bord Fáilte has integrated this initiative into their overall marketing strategy, thereby providing continued support to bed and breakfast operators.</P>

      <P>In line with the commitment set out in the Government's action programme for the millennium, a review of the RTAs was carried out during 1999. In the context of the review, a report on the RTAs was commissioned by BFE from Fitzpatrick Associates to assist their deliberations.</P>
      <P>The objective of the review was to ensure that RTAs would be positioned to make the optimum contribution to the realisation of national tourism objectives and targets set by Government, while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus.</P>
      <P>Discussions between officials from my Department and Bord Fáilte on issues arising from the review process were concluded earlier this year. Bord Fáilte since then have met with the managers of the RTAs to inform them of the new vision for the future of the RTAs.</P>
      <P>A key feature of this vision is the introduction of a formal annual performance contract, between Bord Fáilte and each RTA, covering issues such as BFE funding, visitor servicing, marketing and promotion, tourism development, and the co-ordination role of the RTAs. These contracts are intended to set out the role and what is expected of the RTAs and to lay down indicators for measuring performance.</P>
      <P>In general, RTAs have welcomed this new contractual framework and, to date, all but one of the six RTAs have signed up to the contract. Bord Fáilte are continuing negotiations with the outstanding RTA. I am confident that this new contractual framework, which marks a major advance in the regional administrative structure, will give increased clarity and focus to the work of the RTAs, enabling them to maximise their contribution to regional and national tourism performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish tourism and hospitality industry has been an extremely vibrant one over the past ten years catering last year alone for six million overseas visitors in addition to the rapidly expanding demand from the local domestic market, and bringing over £2.5 billion in foreign exchange revenue into our economy. This success has created new challenges for the industry not only in terms of maintaining its competitive position in an ever more competitive international environment, but also in the competition for staff in Ireland's tightening labour market.</P>
      <P>The tourism and hospitality industry needs to further deepen its relationship with CERT who are actively encouraging and promoting the development of training capacity and better human resource management skills within the industry itself. Achieving this objective will be essential if the industry is to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the overall tourism aim is to help industry secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. The launch in June 2000 by CERT of its strategic plan 2000-06 is an important milestone in this process, which will facilitate raising and maintaining the highest operational and human resource standards in tourism.</P>
      <P>Recently I launched CERT's new nationwide programme to encourage people who have been out of the workforce for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry. This follows on from another scheme launched in May 1999 in Ballymun, targeted at long-term unemployment blackspots, which has proved to be very popular and successful, with participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT's annual careers roadshow is being launched on Monday next, 16 October and will visit a total of 16 venues countrywide and hold over 70 sessions in various second level institutions. It is targeted at second level students from transition year to leaving certificate level and is implemented in partnership with the major industry bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants' Association of Ireland, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association. The roadshow will be advertised through local radio stations and newspapers. Meanwhile on Thursday, 12 <Col N="1411" /> October, I will be launching the careers magazine, Get a Life in Tourism. This magazine is a CERT joint venture with the industry bodies and highlights the variety of careers on offer.</P>
    <P>CERT has also recently launched the new RETAIN initiative to help address serious concerns in the tourism and hospitality industry over recruitment and staff retention. Financial assistance of up to £15,000 over a three year period will be available, under certain conditions, to businesses for improvement in human resources management, the key to tackling industry's staffing problems. These new supports are designed to attract participation in the scheme from firms right across the industry. Smaller companies whose individual needs may not warrant a dedicated human resource professional are being encouraged to consider joining with several others in an application with a view to sharing a dedicated human resource executive. Alongside the new scheme, CERT will be running a series of courses for owners and general managers on modern human resource best practice.</P>
    <P>CERT will be organising a major conference in November on world class service in tourism and hospitality for general managers and senior executives in the industry. Featuring a panel of international speakers and the findings of the latest international research carried out this year, the conference will focus on the best practice in human resources and operations management.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels, I understand that tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Scotland and Wales which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. Recruitment drives are currently being considered for other European locations. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, who welcome employers to such recruitment drives. I understand that the Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual bodies are also participating in EURES, the European employment service, to help satisfy labour shortages in the hospitality sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council statement of strategy, 2000-02 entitled A New Era for Sport was formally launched last month. The strategy statement sets out clearly the council's vision for sport and how it proposes to deliver on that vision. In establishing the council, I envisaged an organisation that would have a positive impact right across the sporting spectrum &ndash; from our outstanding sportspersons, who must be given every opportunity to develop and reach their potential, to the person who wants to take part in sport for recreation and enjoyment purposes.</P>
      <P>As required under the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, the statement of strategy was submitted to me for my approval, and provision of resources from the Exchequer for implementation will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates for the public services, for each of the years covered by the council's statement.</P>
      <P>The strategy incorporates a pathway for the creation of local sports partnerships as a means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level, along the lines envisaged by Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I understand from the council that consultation with the relevant parties, which is the first step in establishing partnerships, has recently commenced.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key social inclusion priorities continues to be the need to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.</P>
      <P>To that end the Government established a pilot integrated services process &ndash; ISP &ndash; with the ultimate aim of improving the effectiveness of service delivery in our most deprived urban areas, as a basis for a model of best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since early 1999, the process has been operating in four urban areas: Dublin's north east <Col N="1413" /> inner city, Dublin 8 &ndash; Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Garden, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House &ndash; Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork.</P>
    <P>A national steering committee, comprising all key Departments, FÁS and area development management &ndash; ADM &ndash;  is overseeing the process.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse Coopers consultancy, which was appointed to carry out an external evaluation, completed its first progress report in April 2000. On foot of this, a progress report was submitted to the Cabinet committee in May and its recommendations were fully endorsed.</P>
    <P>The evaluators' second progress report will be completed shortly and will outline the key elements of a best practice approach capable of replication to other urban blackspots.</P>
    <P>The evaluators will produce a final report in December next when the pilot phase of the ISP is completed. The report will be considered by the steering committee who will make recommendations to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion on the future direction of the ISP.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive review of the national drugs strategy was initiated earlier this year. The objective of the review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to deliver them. The overall aim is to ensure that the policies and strategies which are being pursued at present remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground.</P>
      <P>Due to the high level of public interest in the review and the essential role played by the voluntary and community sectors in the execution of the current strategy, a thorough and lengthy nationwide consultation process was carried out over the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially interested individuals and organisations were invited to make a submission and 189 of these were received. Eight regional consultative fora were also held around the country at which more than 600 people took part. I subsequently invited more than 30 agencies and organisations to make detailed presentations to <Col N="1414" /> further assist in the identification of any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy.</P>

      <P>In March 2000, FÁS established an asylum seekers unit to assist asylum seekers who have been granted the right to work.</P>
      <P>The process that is used is a series of structured interviews, the aim of which is to establish a profile of the education and employment history of the asylum seeker. During the interview process, a range of assessments are used to determine levels of technical or language skills. This provides each individual with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and abilities. The outcome of the interviews and skills assessments are used to ascertain the type of work each individual is best suited to within the Irish jobs market.</P>
      <P>The FÁS asylum seekers unit has introduced a three week intensive English language training programme which is followed by a seven week access to employment programme which focuses on orientation to the labour market in Ireland and includes English language training and IT training modules. To date, approximately 800 people have attended the unit.</P>
      <P>People granted refugee status are fully entitled to access FÁS mainstream training and employment services. In addition, FÁS has developed a specialised English language and information technology programme for refugee trainees. The programme, which was initially piloted in Baldoyle training centre, was mainstreamed in 2000. The programme runs for six months and is available in the following FÁS training centres &ndash; Jervis Street, Baldoyle, Tallaght, Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Shannon and Waterford. On completion of training, participants may move into employment directly or they may progress onto other FÁS programmes. At present, three programmes are running in Dublin, one in Tallaght, one in Jervis Street and one in Baldoyle. A total of 40 refugees are participating. Tralee training centre completed two courses in July 2000 with 28 refugees completing training. Additional courses will run in other FÁS training centres as soon as a need arises in the location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> During the pilot phase, 1997-99, 121 refugees participated on vocational pre-training programmes with FÁS.</P>

      <P>In July, I announced the launch of a new supported employment programme for people with disabilities. Supported employment is a model which places people with disabilities into jobs in the open labour market, working alongside able-bodied people. All of the statutory employment requirements apply to the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supported employment model involves carefully assessing each individual to identify the type of work which will suit him or her; sourcing suitable employment through contacts with employers; placing the individual in employment, <Col N="1416" /> and providing ongoing support and coaching in the workplace, as required. These functions are carried out by a job coach, who works with the employee through each of the phases.</P>
    <P>The supported employment programme is being administered by FÁS on behalf of my Department. In July, FÁS sought proposals to operate supported employment projects from organisations working to integrate people with disabilities into employment. Details of the call for proposals were carried in the national newspapers and on FÁS's website. The closing date for receipt of proposals was 15 September 2000. A total of 48 proposals were received and FÁS is currently assessing them.</P>
    <P>In addition to operating the supported employment programme, FÁS is currently developing the new disability awareness training grant scheme for companies. This scheme will help to integrate people with disabilities into the workplace by providing co-workers with a better understanding of the needs and capabilities of people with disabilities. Grants will also be available to employers for the re-training of workers who acquire a disability, to help such employees to keep their existing jobs or re-train for another job in the same company. The operational details of these schemes are being finalised by FÁS and will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>Statutory protection for consumers in relation to credit agreements is provided for under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs. The provisions essentially cover requirements relating to the form and content of credit agreements, matters arising during the currency of the agreements and matters arising on termination of agreements or on default. These provisions apply in general to all credit agreements, including agreements between a creditor and a borrower which may involve a &ldquo;balloon&rdquo; payment.</P>
      <P>In addition, the 1995 Act lays down specific provisions in relation to consumer hire and hire purchase agreements. Traditionally these have been the two main types of agreement under which consumers acquire cars in Ireland. Garages acting as credit intermediaries on behalf of different financial institutions mainly sell these types of agreement. Under a hire purchase agreement, title to the goods will pass to the consumer once the terms of the agreement have been complied with. Under a consumer hire agreement, the consumer will never have title to the goods, since it is a pure lease agreement. I am given to understand that finance houses, in selling credit agreements of the type referred to by the Deputy, sometimes term them as consumer hire agreements and in other cases as hire purchase agreements. The Director for Consumer Affairs has advised me that this can cause confusion for consumers &ndash; or indeed for credit intermediaries who sell these financial products to consumers &ndash; as to the nature of the finance that is being arranged or offered.</P>
      <P>The message to consumers is to urge them to be vigilant. If consumers are unsure about the category of legal relationship that might be created between them and the lenders in any particular instance, and its potential effect on their statutory rights, they should not hesitate to ask questions. Sources of advice for consumers in this regard include the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the European Consumer Centre.</P>

      <P>On 31 August 2000, the aquaculture licences appeals board granted an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of oysters on a site on the foreshore in Aughris Bay, on determination of an appeal by a number of parties representing local people against a ministerial decision to grant such a licence. A copy of the licence is in the Dáil Library. All aquaculture operations are monitored to ensure compliance with licence conditions. That ministerial decision followed due consideration of objections made to the licence application, notice of which was published, in accordance with the law, in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> on 24 September 1999 and of the applicant's response thereto. Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service &ndash; confirmed that it had no objection to such licensing. Notice of the ministerial decision was sent to the objectors.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture licences appeals board is independent in the performance of its functions and its determinations may only be reviewed by the courts, on foot of an application made within three months of the date of the determination in question.</P>
      <P>The question of designating areas as special areas of conservation or of other heritage importance is primarily a matter for Dúchas. Such designation would not necessarily rule out any aquaculture conducted in a way compatible with any conservation value of the area.</P>
      <P>The statutory arrangements in place since 1998 require publication of a notice in a newspaper circulating in the vicinity of the area in question of all aquaculture licence applications and of all ministerial decisions to grant or to refuse to grant aquaculture licences. Those arrangements are designed to ensure that interested parties and the public generally are aware of all such applications and decisions and of their statutory right to comment on or object to applications or to appeal against decisions. Furthermore, the relevant local authority and harbour authority, regional fisheries board, Dúchas, Bórd Fáilte and An Taisce are supplied directly with a copy of all such applications and decisions, in their own right, under those arrangements, with the statutory right to comment on or object to applications, or to appeal against decisions. As those arrangements appear to be working well, I do not propose to change them.</P>

At present, for example, matching Exchequer funding is being provided for a pilot scheme for the set-aside of salmon draft nets and a salmon trap on the Munster Blackwater. I have requested the regional fisheries boards to encourage the various players in the fisheries regions and catchments to develop similar pilot projects based on consensus and local contribution.</P>

      <P>The number of visas issued to holders of Pakistani passports up to 6 October this year was 2,100, of which 133 have been issued by the consulate in Karachi. A new Honorary Consul in Karachi was appointed earlier this year and the consulate there has been accepting applications for visas since 22 June 2000. The new office is operating satisfactorily under the supervision of the embassy in Tehran, which is accredited to Pakistan. For a few weeks after applications for visas began to be accepted, incorrect charges were being levied for communications and courier service costs but the correct charges are being levied since August. I am not aware of any problems being experienced by applicants for visas and I am satisfied that the consulate is in a position to carry out its duties.</P>

      <P>Algeria signed the Barcelona Declaration on 28 November 1995 and has been a member of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership since that time. The partnership covers three broad areas: political and security co-operation; economic and financial co-operation and social, cultural and humanitarian co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objectives are the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and balanced economic and social development, effective measures to combat poverty and the promotion of greater understanding <Col N="1421" /> between cultures. A primary goal is to create a Euro-Med zone of peace, prosperity and free trade through the implementation of Euro-Med Association Agreements between the EU and each Med partner initially, extending to agreements between the Med countries themselves as circumstances permit. Agreements have been concluded by the EU with Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority &ndash; interim agreement. The target date for the realisation of a regional free trade area is 2010.</P>
    <P>Ireland places a high value on the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a gradually evolving forum for the cultivation of regional stability and prosperity and inter-cultural harmony. During our EU Presidency and since, we have played an active role in advancing the Barcelona process.</P>
    <P>A major focus of Ireland's and the EU's relationship with Algeria is the human rights situation in that country, which remains a serious cause of concern. As part of the dialogue, the EU has encouraged necessary reforms, modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has offered constructive assistance through the partnership. In this partnership dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society.</P>
    <P>With up to one third of its population unemployed, and one third under 30, social and economic stability in Algeria are extremely important and can provide the basis for a peaceful future in that country. Negotiations to conclude an association agreement with Algeria had been dormant since 1997, but were resumed in April of this year. Negotiations are conducted by the commission on behalf of the EU. As with other agreements, this should include further commitments by Algeria to democratisation and the rule of law. It is my understanding that negotiations with Algeria are still at a preliminary stage and I do not expect either side to be in a position to sign such an agreement in the near future.</P>
    <P>These negotiations must be fully consistent with human rights commitments under the Barcelona Declaration. Each partner country in the process has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars. Algeria is also party to a number of human rights conventions, including the international covenants on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It remains our concern that these commitments are fully implemented in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. Irish telecommunications policy has traditionally attempted to ensure the widest possible availability of competitive services throughout the <Col N="1423" /> regions. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to IR£147 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>Two-thirds of the funding under this measure is being made available in the Border, midlands and west region, which contains the counties of Sligo and Leitrim. A competition has been run by my Department to allocate the first IR£77 million of the funding. The competition process was executed over the summer months, with a closing date of 22 September last. Given the liberalised nature of the telecommunications sector, the competition was run on the basis of public sector co-funding of network extensions to regional areas where it would not be commercially viable to do so at this point in time. The competition criteria specifically award points for the provision of services in deficit areas and the removal of regional barriers. Such criteria promote the inclusion of towns such as Ballymote, Tubbercurry and Strandhill in project proposals by telecommunications operators. The town of Strandhill is previously a beneficiary through an Eircom project, which was supported under the National Development Plan 1994-1999. This project involved upgrading of Eircom's switching network throughout the west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extensive mail-out of information surrounded the call for proposals. All communications operators were informed of the possibilities presented by the competition for developing broadband networks in the BMW region. Business and community leaders throughout the BMW region in organisations such as chambers of commerce, local authorities and development agencies were also informed of the opportunities available through both the lobbying of and the developing of partnerships with telecommunications companies. A large number of project submissions from the Border, midlands and west region have been received. The submissions are currently being assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants under the competition criteria. It is anticipated that contracts on selected projects will be signed before the end of the year and work on further exten<Col N="1424" /> sions to broadband networks will start early next year.</P>

The European Parliament is currently considering a number of proposed amendments to the regulation and is expected to vote on these amendments later this month. If agreement is reached by the Council on the text as approved by the European Parliament, it is expected that the regulation will be adopted before the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The AgriFood 2010 Report had included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system <Col N="1427" /> which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful of a positive response.</P>
      <P>Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91 and on 24 August 2000, this regulation was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 which set standards for organic livestock produce. Previously there had been no national standards for organic livestock produce. Under Regulation 2092/91, my Department, which is the competent authority under the regulation, had approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. These bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards that they themselves had set.</P>
      <P>When Regulation 2092/91 was extended to the livestock sector on 24 August, my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulation. My information is that a number of other member states will certify produce as organic which meets those standards and my Department had to bear in mind the fact that such produce could not legally be excluded from the Irish market.</P>
      <P>However, the standards in the regulation did not include all the requirements recommended by the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited. Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has indicated that it is prepared to set certain additional requirements and that others may be considered subsequently by the organic development committee which I am establishing in accordance with the recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 Committee. I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the commitment of Organic Trust and the Irish Organic Farmers' and Growers' Association, together with Demeter Standards Limited, to the principles of ecological sustainability and a guarantee of food quality which are fundamental to organic farming. The additional arrangements that I am now putting in place will ensure continuing adherence to these principles, which are now also increasingly accepted as an integral part of mainstream farming.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious financial difficulties facing hill farmers under the new headage payment proposal; the progress made on the proposal submitted for headage payment of £100 per hectare for the first 25 hectares, £70 per hectare for the next 15 hectares and £50 per hectare for the next ten hectares, resulting in a total payment of £4,050 with an introduction payment of £100 per hectare for the first 25 hectares; when a decision will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July and since approved by the European Commission, some £360 million in additional funding has been committed over the period 2001-06. This will increase the total value of the schemes to £1.08 billion over the period concerned. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001. Total expenditure in 2001 will increase by some £60 million to £180 million. Some 81,000 farmers stand to gain under the new arrangements while about 28,000 will incur some losses. I have however negotiated a compensation package with the European Commission for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
      <P>I am also committed to reviewing the scheme in 2003. At the time the new scheme was agreed in July last, the Irish Farmers Association, in particular acknowledged that the package was a balanced one backed by increased resources which is designed as far as possible at securing the incomes of vulnerable sectors including drystock farmers and both mountain and lowland sheep producers in these areas.</P>
      <P>They also acknowledged that the new package meets the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the incomes of farmers dependent on disadvantaged area payments will be protected. The reality is that moving from an animal based payment system to an area based payment system based solely on the disadvantaged status of the land involves &ldquo;winners&rdquo; and &ldquo;losers&rdquo;.  The scheme model outlined by the Deputy would involve substantial extra funding over and above that already provided under the agreed scheme. The cost of such a scheme would escalate to double the existing cost of £120 million per annum. A scheme costing some £240 million per annum would continue to result in &lsquo;winners' and &lsquo;losers'.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the changes that I made this year to the milk quota regime which operates in Ireland is to ensure that active, committed producers in the various priority categories have greater access to quota on a permanent basis and at a reasonable cost over the coming years. In terms of overall volume, close on 63 million gallons of quota was transferred this year under the restructuring scheme mainly to those categories of producers identified as priority categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operational rules for the restructuring scheme and temporary leasing scheme for this year were designed to take account of the changes to the regime. This year's milk quota restructuring scheme catered, as a matter of priority, for those producers who no longer had access to temporary leased quota on which they had been dependent over recent years and for those producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. It was possible to satisfy 100% of the <Col N="1434" /> entitlements of these producers in a very significant number of cases, in very many others over 90% of the entitlements have been met and only in a relatively small number was less than 70% achieved.</P>
    <P>Priority status in the operation of this year's temporary leasing scheme is afforded to those producers whose full entitlements had not been met under the restructuring scheme, and to those producers who had a track record of purchasing quota under the restructuring schemes over the past three years. The situation of producers who have had disease problems during the past four years is also taken into account in calculating the entitlement to temporary leasing this year.</P>
    <P>I decided to structure this year's schemes in this way following consultation with organisations involved in the industry and taking account in particular of the views of the milk quota review group.</P>
    <P>It was necessary, when deciding on the priorities for this year, to make particular provision for those producers who would be most directly affected by the change to the new regime and whose position, in the absence of priority access to quota, could be worse than last year. In this regard I have specifically asked the milk quota appeals tribunal to look at cases where producers, for reasons outside their control, have the benefit of significantly less quota available to them in the current year than last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed changes for the organic sector in Ireland relate principally to standards for organic food, the introduction of a single national logo, the streamlining of the current inspection arrangements and the establishment of an organic development committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91, and on 24 August 2000 this regulation was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 which set standards for organic livestock produce. Previously there had been no national standards for organic livestock produce. Under Regulation 2092/91 my Department, which is the competent authority <Col N="1435" /> under the regulation, had approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. These bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards they had set.</P>
    <P>When Regulation 2092/91 was extended to the livestock sector on 24 August, my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulation. My information is that a number of other member states will certify produce as organic which meets those standards, and my Department had to bear in mind the fact that such produce could not legally be excluded from the Irish market.</P>
    <P>However the standards in the regulation did not include all the requirements recommended by the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited. Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has indicated that it is prepared to set certain additional requirements and that others may be considered subsequently by the organic development committee which I am establishing in accordance with the recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 committee. I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department will also implement the recommendation in the recent Bord Bia report on Prospects for Organic Food in Ireland that there should be one clear national logo for organic food that can be used to market Irish organic food to both domestic and overseas consumers. I am confident that this measure will bring significant benefits to all Irish organic producers and processors.</P>
    <P>The AgriFood 2010 Report included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently consider<Col N="1436" /> ing these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>
    <P>The organic development committee, which I am in the course of establishing will have representatives of the widest interests in the organic sector including those involved in production, marketing, distribution and retailing, as well as the areas of research, training, advice and regulation. Invitations have issued to the relevant parties to nominate representatives. I have asked the committee to recommend a coherent development strategy to achieve expansion in production, processing and marketing of Irish organic produce and to secure an increased share of the growing national and export markets; and to consider the broad actions necessary for the most advantageous long-term future development of the Irish organic sector while protecting its integrity.</P>

      <P>The option of establishing farm partnerships is already open to producers. However, there may be implications for such partnerships in the context of disease eradication measures, quotas, premium schemes, and other schemes depending on the exact arrangements.</P>
      <P>I have made provision for partnerships involving milk producers in the new milk quota regulations and I hope to announce the detailed rules governing the establishment of these partnerships in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive 1999 and 2000 cattle and sheep headage and premia payments in view of the fact he has called to the local office on seven occasions and no maps were issued to date to sort out any problem that may have arisen and in further view of the fact the applicant is seriously ill and is in severe financial difficulty.</Quest>

      <P>In regard to the 1999 scheme payments the area aid unit issued a map to the person named some time ago in order to enable him to identify the location of a parcel of land included in his 1999 area aid application. The person named has thus far failed to return the map. The Teagasc adviser of the person named has recently been in contact with the area aid unit, and has been sent an additional map in order to enable him to identify the location of the <Col N="1437" /> problem parcel of land on behalf of the person named. An additional over-claim has also been identified on one of the other land parcels claimed by the person named in 1999. Maps have also issued to his Teagasc adviser in this regard and he has been informed of the extent of this over-claim.</P>
      <P>No further 1999 payments can issue until all these matters have been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
      <P>In regard to the 2000 area aid application for the person named, this has now been fully processed with no outstanding errors. The area for payment purposes has been determined at 29.32 hectares and payment under the 2000 sheep headage scheme will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The person named applied under the 2000 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes on 20 April 2000. Following an examination of his applications, it was discovered that a cow, tag number GSA935849, applied on under both schemes, was disposed of on 27 May 2000. Under the terms and conditions of the 2000 cattle headage scheme, animals must be retained for two calendar months starting on the day after an application is received by my Department, and under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme animals must be retained for six calendar months, again starting on the day after an application is received. Under the terms and conditions of both schemes, animals disposed of may be replaced, within 20 days of disposal. However, in this case, the Department was not notified of the disposal of cow, tag number GSA935849, nor was it replaced. The person named was written to on 9 October 2000 and advised that no grants were due on this animal under the 2000 cattle headage scheme or the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme, and that the grants payable on the remaining animals would be subject to reduced payments in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the schemes. He has an opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wishes to put forward to support his case. Any such review will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Extensification premium is payable on all animals paid under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare. The stocking density of the holding of the person named was found to be 1.42 lus-ha, therefore, no entitlement to 1999 extensification premium was established.</P>
      <P>In regard to 1999 scheme applications the person named applied only for special beef premium on 58 animals on 22 January 1999. At an inspection carried out on 23 April 1999 six of the claimed animals were absent. When asked to account for these animals the person named did not present any evidence to support ownership and possession on the date of application. As a consequence he was disqualified from the scheme for one year. The person named was notified of this decision on 14 July 1999. This decision was appealed on 27 July 1999 and was reviewed by a more senior officer. The appeal was rejected on the grounds that no new evidence was presented to establish ownership of the animals in question. The applicant was informed of this on 3 October 1999 and was given the opportunity to appeal this decision to the appeals unit within 21 days. No such appeal or new evidence has been received to date.</P>

      <P>All employers are required to operate PAYE on their employees' pay. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, generally, compliance with the law in this area is good. The vast majority of PAYE tax revenue is paid on time. There is follow-up action by the collector-general's office where payment is overdue. Tax inspectors carry out employer audits to ensure that PAYE is operated correctly. Revenue is not aware of any major problems in PAYE compliance at present. There are always individual problems due to business failure &ndash; but these are the exception.</P>
      <P>The position of employees who have tax deducted under the PAYE system is protected under tax law; the tax deducted is regarded as the tax of the employees and they are credited with this tax whether or not the employer pays the tax to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners continue to operate their annual compliance campaign to ensure that all employers submit a form P35, which is a detailed account of tax paid for each employee and must be submitted after the end of the tax year.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is not considered necessary or practical to issue six monthly statements of the type mentioned. However, if the Deputy has any specific concerns about a particular employer, I would ask her to let me know and I will request the Revenue Commissioners to conduct an investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The anti-bullying and harassment policy for the Civil Service has been drawn up and is being implemented.</P>
      <P>The document A Positive Working Environment presents the anti-harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy for the Civil Service. The policy has been drawn up in consultation with the Civil Service staff unions and reflects those discussions, as well as developments in relation to harassment and sexual harassment arising from the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The policy has been issued to personnel branches in all Departments and offices and to all the Civil Service staff unions. A short leaflet summarising the policy has been issued to all civil servants.</P>
      <P>The policy applies to civil servants, that is, people employed directly by Government Departments and civil servants employed by bodies under the aegis of Government Departments. It does not cover public servants directly. It is the responsibility of public service agencies, as separate employers, to develop their own policies in this regard. However, the Civil Service policy does provide a good model for public service agencies to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of the policy defines harassment, sexual harassment and bullying. It sets out the civil service policy in this regard and elaborates on the types of behaviour that constitute harassment, sexual harassment and bullying. The policy outlines the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, in relation to the statutory offences of harassment and sexual harassment. It also indicates the support and assistance available <Col N="1445" /> from the employee assistance service to parties who are either making, or are the subject of, a complaint of harassment, sexual harassment or bullying. The second part of the policy details the procedures that should be followed in investigating a complaint of harassment, sexual harassment or bullying.</P>
    <P>The policy provides for the appointment of investigators to examine complaints of harassment, sexual harassment or bullying. My Department is in the process of organising training courses for these investigators. To date over 60 persons have received training.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for raising awareness and the detailed implementation of the policy lies with each individual Department or office. I understand that a number of Departments are in the process of developing awareness raising programmes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this is one of the matters examined under their audit programmes. In addition, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs operates extensive checks to ensure the correct treatment of employees. Both agencies also co-operate at local level through the joint inspection units. In practice the main issue that arises is whether an individual is employed or self-employed. In the absence of a legal definition of employment or self-employment this is a matter of fact and is generally quite clear cut in the vast majority of cases. However, there are cases where the decision is not quite so clear. Borderline or disputed cases are considered on their own merits in the light of case law. Any Revenue decision in this area is subject to the normal right of appeal.</P>
      <P>If an individual is an employee there is an obligation on the employer to pay the appropriate social insurance contributions, which may be recovered from the employee.</P>
      <P>To assist employers and individuals to determine their status, Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have issued a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Employed or Self-Employed, A Guide for Tax and Social Insurance&rdquo;. The leaflet was also carried in &ldquo;Tax Briefing&rdquo;, a Revenue publication with a wide circulation among accountants and other tax advisers.</P>
      <P>Revenue is not aware of employees experiencing difficulty, in general, in obtaining P45s. However, if particular circumstances are brought to Revenue's attention, the matter will be investigated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 113, 118, 124, 127, 130, 132 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The strategy being pursued by the health promotion unit of my Department in relation to breastfeeding is in accordance with the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy.</P>
      <P>This policy has guided developments and initiatives in relation to the promotion of breastfeeding. While many recommendations have been implemented, it is acknowledged that the incidence of breastfeeding in this country continues to be lower than that of our European counterparts.</P>
      <P>However, the health promotion strategy published in July this year calls for a more structured approach to the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy. As part of this new strategy, it is proposed to appoint a national breastfeeding co-ordinator who will advise the health promotion unit on the effectiveness of current policy actions in Ireland and on measures required to increase breastfeeding rates. I will consider what new structures may be required in this context, including the re-establishment of a national committee on breastfeeding.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973 and is administered by health boards on my behalf. DCA is paid in respect of eligible children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>As the assessment of entitlement to a domiciliary care allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board in the first instance, the Deputy's question has been referred to the regional chief executive, Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the query and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

The allowance is payable to a person, through their health board, if s/he meets the eligibility criteria set down. To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years, however, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in a particular case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires all private and voluntary nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years. A health board may impose conditions in relation to registration, including a ceiling on the number of persons who may be accommodated in a home. The regulations provide for periodic inspections by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>At the present time, there are no statutory provisions in relation to standards in community nursing units and other extended care facilities for older people operated by health boards. As the House will be aware, a social services inspectorate was set up on an administrative basis last year. The plans for the inspectorate were that it would concentrate for the first three years on child care and, in particular, on children's residential centres run by the health boards. In the longer term, it is planned that the work of the inspectorate will be extended to cover the full range of personal social services provided by the health boards, including extended care services for older people.</P>

I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, I feel that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I recently announced the establishment of an advisory group, to be chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result will greatly enhance the quality of the services currently available to the women of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation that the national drugs strategy team met recently with representative of this organisation and pointed out to it that the funding they are seeking might more appropriately be provided by a health board. The team advised them on how they might go about meeting the criteria set by the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the allocation of such funding.</P>
      <P>I understand that since that meeting officials from the south western area health board have agreed to meet with representatives from the organisation to discuss its services and to look at any appropriate funding proposals. In relation to the assistance which may be given by the national drugs strategy team the health board will liaise with the strategy team about any possibilities in this regard.</P>

      <P>Borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free, since 1980, to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This is a very significant concession the cost of which must be borne by the Exchequer, the housing finance agency or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Borrowers with building society-bank fixed rate mortgages on the other hand are obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months interest or more in the event of early redemption.</P>
      <P>In the past five years the amount outstanding to the local loans fund and the housing finance agency in fixed interest rate loans has reduced significantly, from £509 million to £218 million, indicating that many borrowers have availed of this concession.</P>
      <P>A survey of local authorities, carried out by my Department earlier this year, indicates that out of a total of almost 44,000 individual fixed rate housing loans over 60% of them are at an interest rate less than 12.5%.

      <P>Under the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it is a matter for the relevant local authorities to propose sites for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by town renewal plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing so they are assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them. These set out the purposes and aims of the town renewal scheme, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared, and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. Local authorities were advised that the extent of proposed designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plan should be pro<Col N="1478" /> posed for designation. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
    <P>The role of the expert panel set up by me was to assess the local authority's proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by the local authorities; the panel were confined to examining the sites recommended by the local authorities by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines. The panel comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation etc.</P>
    <P>In the course of its examination of the plans, the panel sought clarification from local authorities in relation to various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented. It is not proposed to make any further designations under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The sites proposed for designation by the local authorities, examined by the expert panels and subsequently approved for designation followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. Therefore, I do not consider that an appeals system is necessary, feasible or practicable. My priority now is to ensure that the scheme is implemented effectively in order to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved.</P>
    <P>The town renewal scheme runs until 23 July 2003.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the fuel allowance to social welfare recipients has not been increased in budgets since 1985; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that fuel prices have increased considerably in recent years; and if he will give a commitment to increase the fuel allowance in the next budget to £10 weekly from mid-October to mid-April.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April regardless of the temperature.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme was £44 million in 1999. To increase the fuel allowance by £1 per week would cost approximately £7.1 million per fuel season. To double the allowance from £5 to £10 per week would cost an extra £35.5 million per fuel season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.</P>
    <P>The group also concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year. Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999 with further increases of either £4 or £7 which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year. This is equivalent to increases ranging from 10% to 16% over two budgets. In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
    <P>The current rate of fuel allowance, £5 per week, was set in 1985. Since then fuel price inflation was much lower than general price inflation up to last year, with an overall cumulative increase of less than 10% over the 14 years between 1985 and 1999. I am aware that an increase of almost 7.9% was recorded in the fuel and light component of the CPI in the 12 months up to last August.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments I have mentioned. What matters to people is the overall total value of their weekly social welfare payment. They are not particularly concerned about how it is made up. The Deputy will know that I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but I assure you that improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget. In the meantime, fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme and this funding has been made available through some 3,000 voluntary organisations. An allocation of £5 million has been made available to the scheme again this year. As applications are currently bring processed by the regional offices of my Department it is not possible to indicate at this stage how many organisations will participate and how many individuals will benefit from the scheme again this year.</P>
      <P>The regional offices of my Department assess applications received under the scheme to determine if they can be funded and, if so, what level of funding should be allocated in each case. When undertaking this assessment my Department takes into consideration the extent to which each application meets the criteria for the scheme and to what extent the most vulnerable older people in our community will be assisted. This assessment also includes examination of accounts submitted by these organisations in respect of funding previously received under the scheme. In addition my Department, when allocating funding, must take account of the overall demands to be met in relation to the available resources.</P>
      <P>All applications received under the scheme are currently being assessed by my Department's regional offices in the manner outlined above and the groups involved will be advised in due course of the outcome of their applications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 168, 185 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>The free electricity-gas allowance and free television licence schemes are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>From this month, all persons over age 75 years are entitled to the free schemes, free electricity-gas allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance, regardless of their income or household circumstances. The free television licence will be awarded from the next due renewal date of the licence following the date of award of the allowance, as is the normal practice.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of these free schemes retain that entitlement provided that prior to the death of the spouse or partner, the couple were permanently residing together. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published last April by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review examined the many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups and to other services using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. It considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic <Col N="1482" /> package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability. The review stated that other groups, for example widow/ers under age 66 years, may experience social exclusion but they are not groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities. It noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes.</P>
    <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age or over to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to all people with disabilities and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass holders are quite capable of travelling alone. The review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs. In view of the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a companion pass should be issued to all people with disabilities who are unable to travel alone. The review estimates that the cost of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to all people in receipt of invalidity pension, regardless of their disability, would be in the region of £1 million per annum. The report examines a large number of issues and the proposals made are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>Social insurance contributions amounting to nearly £2.5 billion were made by employers, employees and the self-employed in 1999. The Revenue Commissioners, acting as agents for my Department, collect the vast majority of these contributions through the combined PAYE/PRSI system. In addition, a relatively small amount of social insurance contributions is remitted directly to my Department by certain employers and self-employed.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides for the deduction and remittance of contributions. The legislation also obliges employers to maintain, for social insurance purposes, detailed records of all persons employed during the course of each tax year, to furnish returns relating to these employees and to issue, either annually or on cessation of any employment, certain statements to employees regarding social insurance contributions. Accordingly, employers make, if applicable, a PRSI deduction from their employee's wages. These contributions, along with the associated employer PRSI contribution, are normally remitted each month to the Revenue Commissioners. Within 45 days of the end of each tax year, the employer is obliged to make a return, P35, to the Revenue Commissioners which details the earnings, employee PRSI contributions, total PRSI contributions, class of PRSI applicable and number of weeks of insurable employment of each person employed during the course of that year.</P>
      <P>Returns in relation to nearly two million employees are made each year. An employer is also obliged to issue to each employee, either on cessation of an employment or within 45 days of the end of each tax year, a statement, either P45 or P60, relating to the individual employee's PRSI and income tax history during the course of that year. Social welfare legislation also provides that an employee may, once every three months, inspect or obtain a statement of the statutory social insurance records which an employer is obliged to maintain in relation to that employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners operate an active intervention management system designed to ensure that PRSI and other statutory deductions are remitted when due and that the necessary returns are made by employers. Revenue also carry out an active audit and PAYE/PRSI inspection programme on an ongoing basis. Where an employee does not receive a P60 at the end of <Col N="1485" /> each tax year or a P45 on leaving an employment, he or she should contact their local inspector of taxes who will initiate appropriate action.</P>
    <P>In addition, some 600 staff in my Department are engaged full-time on anti-fraud and anti-abuse measures, a key element of which is an annual programme of employer inspections.</P>
    <P>More than 6,100 employers have already been visited this year. As part of this inspection programme, inspectors from my Department form part of a nationwide joint inspection unit with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners. This unit uses the combined legal powers and expertise of both organisations to tackle abuses in both the social welfare and tax systems.</P>
    <P>Employer inspections undertaken by my Department comprise a number of tasks such as a detailed examination of employers' records to ensure that accurate records of employees are being maintained and that correct PRSI payments are being made by employers in respect of all their employees; checks to ensure that the correct class of PRSI is being deducted; outlining employers' responsibilities with regard to social welfare legislation and, where Revenue staff are part of the inspection team, tax legislation, and giving advice and information to employers on matters such as the operation of the PRSI system, incentives available to employers, employees' entitlements and the correct classes of contributions.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the level of non-compliance relating to social insurance contributions is significant or increasing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure that the existing provisions relating to social insurance are adhered to by employers. In particular, the P60 document which is issued after the end of each tax year by employers to each employee represents a full statement of the PRSI contribution details for that tax year. A contributor may, at any stage, obtain from my Department a detailed record of their social insurance contribution history.</P>
    <P>In the event of an individual's record being incomplete my Department will take appropriate steps to rectify this, including the collection and recording of outstanding contributions, where necessary.</P>

      <P>The relevant social welfare payments are unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, farm assist, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit, unemployability supplement, invalidity pension, retirement pension and old age contributory pension.</P>

    <P>In addition, where the payment concerned is a social assistance one, a means-tested payment, the claimant is assessed with the spouse or partner's earnings less allowable deductions. Currently, an income disregard of £30, plus travel costs, applies where the spouse or partner is working three days or less, whereas a disregard of £70, inclusive of travel costs, applies where such employment exceeds three days per week.</P>
    <P>Four illustrative examples showing how entitlement to qualified adult allowance is calculated are set out at appendix A. The examples show that the spouse of a claimant of unemployment assistance who works four days per week may earn up to £70 per week without affecting the unemployment assistance payment. The same position applies in relation to other relevant means tested payments. In the case of claimants of the relevant contributory social welfare payments, the earnings of the spouse/partner are not assessable. Consequently, the working spouse may earn up to £70 per week without affecting the entitlement of the claimant irrespective of the number of days worked each week.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are no doubt aware, the tapering arrangements which currently apply were improved substantially as a result of measures introduced following the 2000 budget. These measures were designed to ensure that at the lowest levels of income &ndash; where the spouse's earnings are less than £95 &ndash; the family is never worse off as a result of an increase in earnings. Additionally, the poverty trap arising from the withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance combined with the assessment of the spouse's earnings in the case of recipients of social assistance payments, was further eased by the increase in the spouse income disregard from £45 to £70.</P>
    <P>I will continue to examine the scope for further easing any remaining poverty traps while at the same time ensuring that any new measures introduced do not result in any disincentive to claimants to take up employment.</P>
    <P>Details of the number of social welfare claimants who are in receipt of tapered qualified adult allowance is provided in a table at appendix B. Statistics on the numbers of RP and OACP pensioners in receipt of tapered qualified adult allowance could not be compiled in the time available but will be made available to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As part of the budgetary process, my Department organises a pre-budget forum annually for voluntary organisations representing the interests of social welfare recipients. This year's pre-budget forum will be held on Monday, 23 October 2000. It is anticipated that 28 organisations will be in attendance. The organisations represent the welfare interests of a wide variety of people in Irish society including the elderly, people with disabilities, widows and widowers, lone parents, children, unemployed people, carers and family support groups. The forum gives voluntary organisations the opportunity to have a meaningful input into the budgetary process by ensuring that both I and my officials are fully appraised of their views, concerns and priorities in relation to social welfare improvements.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that it is not possible to extend an invitation to the pre-budget forum on 23 October 2000 to the organisation referred to in the question. It has again been necessary this year to limit the number of organisations attending the forum in view of the tight time frame available to participants to present their views at this one day event. However, I assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the issues which have been raised by the organisation concerned and which have been the subject of correspondence with my Department. It is open to any organisation, including the one concerned, to make a pre-budget submission to my Department on its specific proposals for budget 2001.</P>
      <P>All budget proposals received in my Department, including any from the organisation concerned, will be examined in so far as they relate to social welfare matters. While it would not be possible to meet all of these demands in this year's budget, I will nevertheless be endeavouring to respond to the various concerns being raised in formulating my Department's budget package, having regard to the available resources and to the commitments included in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>Pensions and other long-term social welfare payments have traditionally been paid by pension order books which are encashable on a weekly basis at post offices. Payment can also be made, at the person's choice, direct to bank accounts through electronic fund transfer.</P>
      <P>Payment of pensions by electronic fund transfer is generally made every two weeks in arrears. Most pensioners who opt to be paid by EFT do so at new claim stage so there is no interruption of the flow of payments once the claim is allowed. Where an existing pensioner opts to switch to EFT the different payment cycle will mean that there is an interruption in payment.</P>
      <P>The question of aligning payment frequencies is under active consideration but due to other pressing demands on available resources it may not be possible to accommodate this change for some time. However, additional steps are being taken to ensure that pensioners who opt to have their payments changed to EFT are fully aware of the different payment cycles.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and certain people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force.

The scheme applies to persons in receipt of long-term disability payments but does not apply to persons in receipt of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Under the disability benefit scheme it is possible for a person to be exempted from the rule that they undertake no paid work while in receipt of benefit. Such an exemption would enable the person to undertake part-time work of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature or a training course to fit them for other work.</P>

      <P>Since April 1999 a special old age contributory pension has been available to those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at <Col N="1492" /> least five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable. This special arrangement more than complies with this Government's pre-election commitment to ease the position of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension and represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this group of people found themselves. I have no plans to make further changes.</P>

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Where a person in direct provision receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child. Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the state where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments will be made by the health board.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation in direct provision and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to £76.00 per week for a single adult, £123.00 per week for a couple and £13.20 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who arrived in the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to £64 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to £179 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.</P>
      <P>At present there are 7,715 supplementary welfare allowance claims in respect of approximately 13,005 asylum seekers. Of these 1,658 claims are in respect of people in direct provision and they receive the reduced allowance as outlined. In addition there are 1,010 asylum seekers covered by unemployment assistance claims and the payment rates are equivalent to SWA rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one parent family payments, pensions or disability allowance. Asylum seekers and refugees are also entitled to claim child benefit. The monthly rate is £42.50 for the first and second child increasing to £56 for third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>An Post is the principal agency through which payments are delivered to social welfare customers. Over the years An Post's role has been expanded to include a range of social welfare payments. It is estimated that An Post will deliver about 42 million social welfare payments during 2000. This represents approximately 75% of all social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>An Post provides these services to my Department in accordance with a five year contract which was signed in 1992 and extended for a further three years in 1997. The Government decided in 1999 that the contract between my Department and An Post should be extended for a further three years, 2000 to 2002 inclusive. Following this decision certain issues were raised with the EU Commission concerning, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the contract must under EU law be offered to the market. The Commission has not yet completed its examination of these issues but I expect that this process will be completed in the reasonably near future.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to lone parents and long-term unemployed persons to return to the active labour force. The scheme has a limited number of places and it is targeted at people who need the additional income support which the scheme pro<Col N="1494" /> vides in order to make it financially attractive to them to return to employment. The rules of the scheme therefore require that an application must be made prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>Claims made after the person has started work indicate that the person was in a position to take up employment without the need for the financial support which the scheme provides.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 20 March 2000. His application was received in the Department on 29 August 2000 &ndash; five months later &ndash; and was refused on that basis.</P>

    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that some caution is required in interpreting these figures. The percentage area represents marine as well as land areas, with the total including marine areas expressed as a percentage of land area. Rivers and lakes are counted as land. For example 25.3% of the area of proposed SACs in County Mayo reduces to 20.2% if large marine areas are excluded from the calculation.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for a list of townlands, wholly or partially included in SAC and NHAs in county Mayo, to be transmitted directly to the Deputy.</P>

The working group, which has been set up in accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, comprises representatives of relevant Departments including the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Health and Children, the social partners and State agencies. The group first met on 14 April 2000 and eight meetings have been held to date. The next meeting is scheduled for 13 October. It is hoped to finalise the work of the group shortly after that date.</P>
      <P>The group has considered a variety of issues in the course of its deliberations to date, including the question of an increase in the period of maternity leave.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental review group, chaired by an official from my Department, is currently examining the reliefs available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme. The scheme provides reliefs from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on vehicles and from excise duty on fuel to drivers and passengers who are severely and permanently physically disabled.</P>
      <P>While a sizeable number of submissions had already been made to the group prior to May 2000, the review group placed advertisements in the national newspapers in early May 2000 seeking written submissions from members of the public concerning the scheme in order to ensure that it would benefit from as full a consultation process as possible. To date over 250 submissions have been received, reflecting over 60 different disabilities.</P>
      <P>The review group also held 22 individual hearings between May and September with representatives of various organisations and with a number of persons who had indicated a desire to make oral submissions to it.</P>
      <P>The insights obtained from an analysis of the oral and written submissions, when added to the knowledge already gained from the submissions which it received from members of the public and from public representatives, will assist the group in bringing its work to a conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration by the Minister for Finance. The group is now undertaking an examination of comparable international schemes.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the group will be in a position to report on its conclusions by early 2001. Extensive consultations have taken place. I am satisfied that due to the complex nature of the issues it was important to ensure that all people with disabilities and interested parties had an opportunity to contribute to the review and that the review group had adequate opportunity to consider the issues involved.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999, S.I. No. 4 of 1999, provide for a voluntary national age card scheme whereby any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his-her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The regulations came into effect on 19 April 1999. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square have been given responsibility, under the regulations, for the issuing of the cards. A total of 16,100 age cards have been issued as of the beginning of October 2000 and an average of 150 applications are being received daily.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a written proposal has been submitted by a company relating to age cards. The company has proposed that it replace the existing age cards and introduce a system called Viage, which is an age verification system using a swipe card and an electronic verification unit. The introduction of this system would mean that owners of licensed premises etc. would each have to purchase a verification unit.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that members of the Garda Síochána met with representatives of the company last month and were given a demonstration of the Viage system.</P>
      <P>The representatives of the company were informed that while the Garda Síochána would consider their submission without delay, further information on the Viage system was required before it could be fully assessed. The representatives from the company undertook to obtain and submit this information and accepted that it was not feasible for the Garda Síochána to fairly assess their proposal without being in possession of this further information.</P>
      <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that the feasibility of the Viage verification system cannot be adequately examined pending receipt of the additional information sought.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to make any other comment on the proposal at this stage.</P>

It would make no sense to make the scheme mandatory because it would then apply to all persons even those who do not wish to enter a licensed premises.</P>

It is modelled on the successful group treatment programme which has been running in Arbour Hill since 1994.</P>

      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Applications may then be considered by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, who will make a recommendation to me in this regard. While no formal application has been received to date for Kilkenny city, I can confirm that I have received correspondence from Kilkenny Corporation regarding a CCTV system for the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the advisory committee has received in excess of 40 applications for Garda CCTV systems as aids to policing. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems. These are, in alphabetical order, Bray, Cork, <Col N="1505" /> Dublin south central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick. The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin south central to include Grafton Street and its surrounding areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The remaining applications are under consideration.</P>
    <P>Some delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects due, in part, to the fact that the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has also impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I therefore decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to air pistols which are capable of firing pellets.</P>
      <P>Air pistols are classed as firearms under the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 2000. The position in relation to the importation and possession of air pistols is, therefore, the same as with other firearms.</P>
      <P>A firearm or ammunition may not be imported into the State without an importation licence issued by my Department. In addition, a person may not be in possession of a firearm or ammunition without a firearm certificate granted under the firearms legislation. Furthermore, it is the policy not to grant importation licences or firearm certificates for handguns. Any person who contravenes these provisions is guilty of an offence and is liable to the penalties provided under the legislation.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a number of air pistols were purchased by students while on holiday abroad last year. These weapons were seized by the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that they are aware of various incidents involving young people and air pistols where persons have been injured. Appropriate action was taken when the incidents were brought to their attention. The Garda authorities have advised schools of the dangers associated with air pistols and have requested that they should be informed of any related incidents.</P>
      <P>In addition, travel agents have also been made aware of the legislation relating to the importation of these weapons as have post offices as occasionally these weapons are illegally imported by mail order.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are not aware of these weapons being used in criminal activities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the firearms legislation makes adequate provision for the seizure of any firearm which is unlawfully imported by any person or which is in the unlawful possession of any person.</P>

The report also recommends that, regardless of religion, the lateral entry of experienced officers from other police services should be actively encouraged.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report recommends a programme of personnel exchanges between the Garda Síochána and the police service in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The full implementation of the Patten report is a key element in the peace process and progress on this matter is to be welcomed. In this context, I have noted the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's comments with interest.</P>

      <P>The directorate for asylum support services was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department to co-ordinate, <i>inter alia</i>, the sourcing of suitable accommodation for asylum seekers and their resettlement at locations throughout the country.

      <P>On 16 October 1999 an inmate of Mountjoy male prison was discovered by an officer hanging by a bed sheet from a beam in the toilet area of the B base. Prison staff immediately commenced CPR and did everything possible to revive him until the ambulance service arrived. He was taken to the Mater Hospital where he was pronounced dead. The deceased was on remand. He was due to appear in court on 22 October 1999.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal practice, the death was the subject of a Garda investigation and a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest. The Garda concluded that they are satisfied that the death was not suspicious nor did they suspect any third party involvement. The circumstances of the death were also examined by the suicide awareness group in Mountjoy prison.</P>
      <P>At the coroner's inquest the jury agreed a verdict of death by suicide caused by hanging. The jury made a recommendation that in future before maintenance work commenced in prisons a risk assessment should be carried out by a health and safety officer.</P>
      <P>The requirements for the safe execution of works within prisons and places of detention are laid down by Statutory Instrument No. 138 of 1995, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations and were implemented in all prisons and places of detention shortly after its introduction. Prior to any refurbishment or maintenance works being undertaken a health and safety plan is prepared which includes the identification of possible hazards.</P>
      <P>The national steering group on deaths in custody is scheduled to meet on Thursday 12 October 2000. I have asked the group to consider the recommendation made in this particular case with a view to considering if further action may be required and to make recommendations to me in this regard.</P>
      <P>In any event, all governors, health and safety personnel and the local suicide awareness groups in all prisons and places of detention will be made aware of the recommendation of the jury. I will also request the governors of all prisons and places of detention and all other relevant personnel in my Department to review the procedures in the light of the recommendation made.</P>

      <P>This Government has signalled its commitment to the development of sport and recreation by increasing the funding available from £13.5 million in 1997 to over £51 million this year.</P>
      <P>This increase includes provision for: a trebling in funding for the sports capital programme from £5 million in 1997 to £15 million in 2000; a fourfold increase in the provision for the swimming pool programme from £3.5 million in 1997 to £15 million in 2000; almost £6 million towards the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool and £20 million support towards the development of Croke Park; athletics facilities in Navan, Galway, Cork, Nenagh and Castleisland; £4.8 million towards the provision of the new indoor athletics facility being planned for Morton Stadium; grants to GAA and soccer grounds; and grants to the value of £36 million have been allocated this year to almost 700 clubs and organisations around the country towards the provision of sport and recreation facilities to help ensure a network of well planned, well managed and appropriate facilities to meet the needs of training, coaching and competition across a wide spectrum of sports.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that, under schemes now operating since 1 July 1999 under the aegis of the statutory Irish Sports Council, the national governing bodies of sports receive funding towards their activities including the provision and development of coaching. In addition, the Sports Council also provides funding to the national coaching and training centre for the development and enhancement of coaching in Ireland as well as for the provision of physiological, scientific, medical and other related services to elite individual competitors and squads.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that that there is now under way an ambitious programme of State assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has increased funding for the development of sport and recreational facilities by over 350% since coming into office, from £8.5 million in 1997 to £41.07 million in the Estimates for the year 2000. This includes: more than a trebling in funding for the sports capital programme from £5 million in 1997 to £15.2 million in 2000; more than a quadrupling in the provision for the swimming pool programme from £3.5 million in 1997 to £15.18 million in 2000; assistance for the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool; a £20 million grant towards the development of Croke Park; a commitment to the provision of a new state of the art indoor athletic facility planned for Morton Stadium with a grant of £4.8 million allocated.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme provides funding for sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with all the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. My Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Government Departments and with the local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, special priority is given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. In addition, applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and the local authority before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national level are also required to ensure that the proposals are consistent with the priorities of their respective national governing bodies.</P>
      <P>This year, under my Department's sports capital programme, an amount of £36 million is being allocated to nearly 700 projects around the country.</P>
      <P>This programme, together with the expanded local authority swimming pool programme, the 50 metre pool in Limerick, the improved Croke Park and planned development of Sports Campus Ireland and Morton Stadium, Santry will provide the country with a much increased range of top class indoor and outdoor sports facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national development plan financial assistance amounting to £85 million will be avail<Col N="1515" /> able over the seven years of the plan to support the development of sport and recreational facilities by local authorities, particularly in areas which lack them and for voluntary groups developing multi-sport and recreational facilities where no such facilities currently exist.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and I am sure the House will agree, that there is now under this Government an ambitious programme of State assisted expansion under way in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

      <P>No distinction is made between asylum seekers and refugees or other categories of non-nationals at primary or post primary levels where provision of resources is concerned. At primary level an additional appointment is sanctioned in the case of schools, which have fifteen or more non-national pupils enrolled, to cater for their English language needs. To date 62 teachers have been sanctioned for this purpose.

    <P>At second level the authorities of individual schools or vocational education committees may apply for support for additional teaching hours in <Col N="1516" /> respect of non-national students having significant English language deficits.

    <P>My Department supports the refugee language support unit in Trinity College and this unit is responsible for the delivery of English language courses for adult refugees as well as the training of teachers for non-national students, the preparation of teaching materials and the devising of new English language programmes for non-national persons.</P>
    <P>With regard to the numbers of non-national persons participating in the programmes mentioned, I will communicate this information to the Deputy when the data have been compiled fully by my Department. Assuming that the question refers to FÁS courses, my Department will liaise with the relevant Department in order that the appropriate information is provided.</P>
    <P>The provision of support for the education of non-national persons is kept under continuous review and there will be a major review of the functioning of the refugee language support unit in March, 2001, when the unit has completed a two-year pilot phase.</P>

      <P>The after school projects at Brookfield and Fettercairn are two of four components of south Dublin urban initiative's after school project. Two of the components &ndash; Clondalkin project for traveller children and the Neilstown-<Col N="1519" /> Deansrath project &ndash; have already been successful in securing funding from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>St. Aidan's community school, which is the post primary school associated with the Brookfield project, is included in the stay in school retention plan introduced in 1999. After school supports form part of a range of supports being put in place by individual schools as part of a plan to retain pupils to completion of senior cycle. The retention plan will form the core of a contract between the school, in collaboration with local service providers, and my Department. There is extensive scope for collaboration and integration between the SSRI and the Brookfield initiative.</P>
      <P>St. Anne's junior and senior schools are the two primary schools associated with the Fettercairn project. A comprehensive survey of primary schools was completed on my behalf earlier this year by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. The results of the survey will allow for the identification of levels of disadvantage in primary schools. Based on the levels of need identified, the objective will be to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions that will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they need to succeed in education. Support for the schools in question is being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>Swimming is part of the aquatics programme of the revised curriculum for physical education in primary schools. This programme is presented as one complete unit in the PE curriculum without division into class levels. This allows for adaptation by schools related to their access to a local facility. The programme can be implemented progressively at whatever stage the child has an opportunity to begin water-based activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> There is no specific grant assistance provided by my Department for expenses incurred in connection with swimming as opposed to other activities covered under physical education in the revised curriculum. There is, therefore, no specific funding to cover the cost to schools of the provision of swimming lessons. My Department will, however, shortly circulate all primary schools with details of a new physical education grant. It will be open to schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, to utilise part or all of this grant for the provision of swimming instruction should they so desire.</P>

      <Quest>if the request of the board of management of O'Connell CBS school, North Richmond Street, Dublin 1, for an additional remedial teacher will be agreed to in view of the 108 children in need, the majority of whom do not have a remedial teacher.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The school in question currently has the services of a remedial teacher on a full-time basis. It also has the support of a resource teacher post which was deployed to cater for children with special learning needs attending the school on an integrated basis. In addition, a special class teacher has been allocated to cater for children with a mild general learning disability attending the school.</P>
      <P>In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were advised that they could seek a remedial service if they could demonstrate a need for such a service. My Department sanctioned the appointment of 148 full-time remedial teachers and a further 27 remedial post equivalents in part-time hours in order to facilitate the extension of the service to every primary school in the country for the 1999-2000 school year. A further 15 full-time remedial posts were subsequently sanctioned to address the particular needs of a number of very large schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the remedial needs of the school to which he refers will be fully <Col N="1521" /> considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve the level of existing remedial services. In the meantime, I have asked my Department's inspectorate to report on the school's need for additional special support.</P>

      <P>In order to extend the service to all primary schools, my Department allocated 148 full-time remedial teacher posts and a further 27 posts in part-time remedial allocations at the commencement of the school year 1999-2000.

      <P>The operational arrangements relating to the assessment and certification of apprentices under the standards based apprenticeship system which were agreed by all relevant groups were set out in a letter from my Department to the various institutes of technology in December 1995. The arrangements clearly stated that assessment for phase 4 would consist of two occasions of testing and that a terminal examination would only apply at the end of phase 6 of the apprenticeship system. This latter would be the only situation in <Col N="1524" /> which payment for an examination as part of the apprenticeship system would be made.</P>
      <P>In August 1999 it was brought to the attention of my Department that some institutes of technology were conducting both occasions of phase 4 testing at the end of phase 4. My Department subsequently issued circular letter No. 1T 9/99 on the assessment regulations governing phase 4 procedures reiterating the position as set out in 1995. All directors of institutes of technology and the President of Dublin Institute of Technology were directed to ensure that the sanctioned arrangements would be complied with.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this direction, the Department has been advised that in latter months certain phase 4 assessment results have been withheld by staff in the institutes, who are TUI members, who are seeking examination payments in respect of this testing. Efforts to resolve the dispute are ongoing.</P>
      <P>A total of 624 phase 4 apprenticeship places were provided on the 13 week summer course in 2000 and there was 97% uptake of this course. Assessment procedures used for students on the summer courses are the same as those sanctioned for all other phase 4 apprentices.</P>

      <P>The difficulties arising in the Dublin 15 area due to the lack of places in certain postprimary schools are being addressed by my Department as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The position is quite complex because, while some schools in the area are full to capacity, others are in a position to offer places. My Department is in ongoing communication with all of the schools concerned to determine how the anticipated difficulty in September 2001 can be averted and to secure agreement on a co-operative enrolment process in the area.</P>
      <P>The level of housing development in Dublin 15 is such that further educational provision at first and second level will be required. My Department is addressing this issue as a matter of priority in consultation with Fingal County Council.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any direct press statement relating to this matter in September 2000, however if the Deputy wishes to forward further details to my office I will forward a response to the matters of concern as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>An additional 27 posts were allocated to the planning and building unit of my Department in April 2000 as part of an overall planned increase in the staffing of my Department. The additional posts are included in the table. A number of the new posts have been filled and every effort is being made to fill the remaining vacant positions as quickly as possible. However, the Deputy will be aware that Government Departments are facing the same labour market constraints as other sectors at present and the filling of vacancies is taking longer than had been anticipated.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the filling of the vacant posts is receiving urgent attention.</P>

      <P>The stage 4 and 5 reports, detailed design &ndash; tender documentation in respect of the proposed extension to St. Declan's Community College, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford are being considered within my Department. The project has been delayed because it was necessary for the design team to carry out a number of amendments to the documentation already submitted.</P>
      <P>The question of inviting tenders for this project will be decided when the analysis of the stage 4-5 reports is complete.</P>

      <P>A review of primary school accommodation needs in the general area referred to by the Deputy has been carried out by my Department. As a result of this review, a need has been identified for a new primary school to meet the demand for school places arising from the growth in population due to significant housing development in the area.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are now being made in relation to the patronship of the proposed school. When this issue has been finalised, the question of acquiring a suitable site will be addressed.</P>
