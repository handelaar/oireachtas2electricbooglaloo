      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the urgent matter of the startling admission this morning by the chief executive of Eircom that the company knew that the IPO share price was overvalued by up to 30%, for the Minister for Public Enterprise to confirm that she was aware of this view within the company and when she became aware that KPN and Telia were going to sell the shares after six months from the date of the IPO, and the need for the Government to apologise to the hundreds of thousands of shareholders who are now facing the prospect of considerable losses.</P>

      <P>With regard to the preparation of the promised Postal and Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill for ESOP and An Post and the Telecommunications Regulation Bill, is the Government in agreement with the chief executive of Eircom that the people who bought shares were duped and that the Government overpriced the shares in a fashion that has done damage to the prospect of future sales of shares to the public of assets that were previously State owned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, will make provision for ESOP and An Post. The heads of the Bill are in preparation and the legislation is expected next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the substantial point of my question? All the people are talking today about the fact that the chief executive of Eircom said the Government overpriced the shares. As he was one of those responsible for this decision and given that he has a financial background, is the Taoiseach contradicting what Mr. Alfie Kane said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospectus and the price range set prior to the flotation were agreed by the Government and the company. Mr. Alfie Kane is the chief executive of that company. The final price of 3.07 was within this price range and just above the mid-point of the range. The balance sheet of the company at the time of the flotation was very strong. The price set by the Government for Eircom at the flotation was set on the basis of what the market was prepared to pay. The strategic partners in Eircom were prevented from selling their shares in the company for up to six months. The position was made clear in both the main prospectus and the mini prospectus.</P>
      <P>The pricing of the shares in July 1999 was a delicate one, balancing the need for a fair price for the taxpayers and a fair return for retail and institutional investors. The Government could have chosen to float the company at a higher price than it did but chose not to do so. The joint global co-ordinators at the time wanted us to float it at 3.27.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach know that the shares were overvalued by 30%?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath of the flotation the shares rose by 20%. The share price has been below the issue price on 35 of the 230 days since their launch and the potential return for Eircom investors&mdash;</P>

Bonus shares of one for every 25 shares held will be issued to people who retain their shares after July. That is equivalent to 4% interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate this matter further now. This is the Order of Business, it is not a debate. I call Deputy Quinn on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that when it next goes to the polls the electorate will bear in mind the lecture by the Taoiseach on the vagaries of capitalism. Last week the House debated the issue of donations to political parties. On schedule A of the list of promised legislation is a Standards in Public Office Bill &ndash; No. 8 under the Minister for Finance. This Bill has been in formulation in committee prior to its publication. I understand that committee work has been completed and the Bill is due to be completed between now and the end of this session, which is four weeks away. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Bill will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's intention was to publish the Bill this session but Deputy Quinn will recall that two weeks ago because suggestions were made regarding many other issues that would not perhaps have been comprehensively dealt with in that legislation, I offered some new ideas and suggested we would cover some of those items in that Bill and discuss them in an all-party committee of the House. I still think that is the best way forward. If that offer is not taken up, then the Government will publish the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the work of the committee has already been done in respect of this legislation and it is incumbent on the Government to publish that legislation if it is ready to be published? The offer to which he has just referred was only made last week. This legislation was scheduled for publication this session, of which there are only four weeks left. Will the Taoiseach publish it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter I have raised already, does the Taoiseach agree that we should have a debate in the House on the pricing of the Eircom shares given that we need to have people willing to invest in shares as part of the preparation for their own retirement and the accumulation of savings in productive business? Would <Col N="1284" /> the Taoiseach agree that this mess has done a great deal of damage which could best be allayed by an open debate in the House rather than by the<i> ex parte</i> statement he has just made, to which the Opposition does not have the capacity to respond?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is an appropriate matter for debate then it can be looked at. If we are to get into a position where we debate the ups and downs every time there is movement in the shares of companies that have been floated&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is one of information. The chief executive officer said the public did not know. The Minister will go on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; show but she cannot make a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate in the House every time share prices go up and down. I advise Deputy Yates when he is talking about public flotations and flotations of this type, there are prudential rules that have to be followed. In this case, the company had both international and domestic advisers. The decision was based on advice which cost about £28 million to secure.</P>

      <P>It is normal when the schedule is published for a resumé of the contents of the Bill to be included. Will they include any amendments to the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act and if not, is there other legislation that will update that legislation in the light of public disquiet?</P>

      <P>The heads of the Garda Síochána Bill are to be circulated to the Departments for observations. It is unlikely that Bill will be circulated until next year. The Department of <Col N="1285" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform is completing a review of the operation of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, to which the Deputy referred. It is doing that on the basis of recommendations for change made by the complaints board. I do not have the details of that. I understand the Minister hopes to be able to bring to Government over the summer proposals for improvements to the Act .</P>

        <b>:</b> On promised legislation, eight young heroin addicts died in Dublin hospitals over the past two weeks and three in the past 48 hours from suspected doctored or contaminated heroin. When will we come to grips with the growing drugs epidemic and when we will see the long-promised legislation concerning the drugs courts which will recommend a humane treatment regime rather than the existing regime of throwing drug addicts into prison where they do not receive any treatment?  </P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda is investigating the case mentioned by Deputy Higgins so I will not comment on it. Proposals for legislation to set up the drugs court should arise from the Government decision agreeing to the establishment of the planning committee which has made proposals which the Minister is considering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will any promised legislation deal pro-actively with the runaway growth in greenhouse gas emissions? The Irish energy centre Bill seems to refer to the issue. Is that to be brought forward and is any similar legislation to follow? Is the Taoiseach aware of the flaw in the Waste Management Act which has failed to obtain any prosecutions in the courts? Is there any legislation promised in that area which would try to close off that legal loophole?</P>

The first is the national pension reserve fund, No. 6 on the list, and the second one is the National Treasury Management Agency Bill, which has been promised now for just over three years in one guise or another.

      <P>Before Easter I raised with the Taoiseach the question of the judges inquiry Bill that arose last year in the context of the possible implementation of a threat to impeach judges under the Constitution. At the time it was pointed out that we did not have a judges inquiry Bill setting out the legislative steps that should be taken and how the impeachment process would be handled in this House. Since then, we have had a recommendation from the all-party committee for a judges inquiry Bill. We now have another inquiry under way into a judge and the question may have to be faced fairly quickly as to how we would handle an impeachment process in the House. Does the Taoiseach accept the need for a judges inquiry Bill to deal with the impeachment process and can he tell the House at this stage whether he will take steps to introduce such a measure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a need to deal with this matter. There is a judges inquiry commission under the Chief Justice examining this area. We may have to deal with it by reference to the Constitution. Whatever we do in legislation will be on the basis of the report of the committee currently working on this, which was set up this time last year. I do not know what stage its work is at, but we await its report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Finucane I understand the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources will take the required action by regulations to meet the matters raised.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Finucane and Bell for their assistance in getting the Bill through the House in a speedy manner. A large number of amendments were tabled on Committee Stage, some of which were substantial. While they were significant in detail, particularly those to the part of the Bill which provides for the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, the Bill is considerably strengthened as a result of their inclusion. Deputy Bell tabled two important amendments which the Minister was happy to accept. I thank the Deputies for their helpful and constructive approach to this important Bill on all Stages. The Minister looks forward to bringing it to the Seanad. Regrettably, he is unable to be present.</P>
      <P>Apart from providing for the establishment of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board and associated powers, the Bill is important in that it also provides for the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, to enable the Minister to provide a legislative framework to regulate the use of recreational craft, including jet-skis and fast-powered craft. The amendment has been designed to provide the legislative framework recommended by the action group on small powered recreational craft in its report presented on 18 April 2000. As a result the Minister will be empowered to regulate for the safety of recreational craft, their occupants and, most significantly, other persons and property from injury or damage caused by or resulting from the use of recreational craft.This meets the needs of Opposition Deputies. The Minister recognises this issue, as I did when Minister, and this will allow for worthwhile developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. He is aware of the safety factor involved in all kinds of craft. This Bill focuses on jet skis, power boats and pleasure craft. Investigations are taking place regarding activity centres and I presume legislation will be introduced by the end of the year to deal with this sector. There was a recent boating tragedy off County Louth and when Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods indicated he would make life jackets compulsory on vessels. Will the Minister clarify this issue as I have received communications which are borne out by a series of incidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, four Air Corps personnel were killed in a tragic accident off County Waterford. The parents of one of the deceased wrote to me concerning the fact that people are going out on <Col N="1291" /> boats without flares, radios, radar and even life jackets. The lives of rescue personnel are being put at risk by people behaving in a foolhardy manner. Waterford has been a focal point concerning the issue of safety because four lives were tragically lost at Tramore, Ross Davies tragically lost his life at the adventure centre in Dunmore East and there was the incident off County Louth. Will the Minister clarify what regulations regarding sailing or pleasure craft will be in place for the summer? What regulations are in place and when do officials intend to have regulations implemented for pleasure craft or jet skis? This is a growth business and many young people use these lethal machines. How will this issue be catered for under by-laws if a person on a jet ski is half a mile off the coast? We sought clarification on these issues on Committee Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The heads of the Bill dealing with adventure centres are expected to go before Cabinet within the next two weeks. The regulations will be introduced as soon as this legislation is passed and they will cover age limits and life jackets. They will define dangerous driving and deal with other issues mentioned by the Deputy. The regulations will be available during the summer if not at the beginning of the summer. It depends on the speed at which legislation is passed. Work is under way on the regulations and they will be introduced as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments concerns the Minister's duty in respect of the commencement of the Bill when enacted and ensures the Act will be commenced within two years and that the Minister must keep the Houses informed of progress. The amendments go somewhat further than amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton. However, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 7. The issue of resources is one which the House has ample opportunity to discuss during the debate on the Estimates and it is not appropriate to further deal with the issue during the process of the commencement of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's move to require that the whole Act comes into operation within two years, he is less than generous in establishing that we will have a report only every second year, as proposed by amendment No. 15. I do not see the rationale for reporting every second year when annual reporting is the standard basis for accounting in every other area of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 goes to the heart of the Bill as everyone recognises there is a serious problem <Col N="1293" /> with absenteeism. Reports in last week's newspapers indicated that absenteeism in Ireland is double that of most European countries. Conservative estimates put the figure at 15,000 children at primary level who are regularly absent over and above an acceptable standard and another 13,000 children who are regularly absent at secondary level. We are talking about a Bill which will deal, potentially, with up to 28,000 children.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being enacted without outlining its resource implications and how we will man the board. We are moving from a position where there are education welfare officers in a few urban areas, and only part of the greater Dublin urban area, to one in which we are proposing national coverage for an education welfare service. However, there is no signal as to the resource implications of this development. This is particularly the case regarding schools which will have to carry much of the new formal requirements of reporting but also the requirement to develop and implement a policy for effective school attendance. This will require significant change in the way schools do business.The Minister is short-changing us by attempting to bring in this on the nod without explaining in a systematic way the implications for schools and other bodies which will implement the Bill. All the Minister said is that £250,000 will be provided this year, £1 million next year and a further £2 million in a couple of years. However, as we know, that is only a drop in the ocean in comparison to the needs of 28,000 pupils. There is a need for a firm statement in relation to how the Bill will be implemented and how an effective education welfare service will reduce the serious problems in relation to absenteeism, which also leads to the exceptionally high problems regarding early school leaving and literacy as shown in numerous surveys.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Deputy's concerns about the years, the Minister will, in effect, report annually. The provision states &ldquo;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the end of each of the 2 years . . .&rdquo;  This is the way the parliamentary draftsman phrased it. The Minister will report in each of the two years. After two years, there will be full annual reports in any event involving the board so the Deputy's point is covered. That may not appear to be the case in terms of the wording of the provision, but it states the Minister shall &ldquo;.after the end of each of the 2 years immediately following the passing of the Act, prepare a report . . .&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>No, that is incorrect. The Deputy can take my word for it that it is annual. The matter was discussed with the parliamentary draftsman and that was how he said it should be <Col N="1294" /> worded. I assure the Deputy there will be reports each year.</P>
      <P>There will be many general requirements for implementing the Bill and the Government is committed to this area. It has provided resources to ensure there is a major drive in this area. This will be a major policy plank in tackling the problems to which Deputy Bruton referred. It is a serious problem and for the first time resources are being provided to tackle it in a major way through the board and immediately following the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 7, I categorically do not accept the Minister's assurances. The record speaks for itself. The School Attendance Act was introduced in 1926 but successive Governments allowed it to fall into disuse. There was no commitment in this area. The track record is one of the Department of Education and Science failing to implement its obligations under Acts. I am not reassured that resources will be available.</P>
      <P>The precise number of new education welfare officers or how schools will be assisted in undertaking their new responsibilities was not made clear on Second or Committee Stages. It has not been made clear how schools can develop effective school attendance policies which would value children who have abandoned school. It is not that they have dropped out, rather that many of them find school has nothing to offer them. We will seriously undersell ourselves if we allow the Bill to pass without the issues raised in amendment No. 7 being properly assessed by the Department. This assessment should be laid before the House so Members can be satisfied that we are not only engaged in an exercise of rubber stamping as, unfortunately, the legislators in the 1920s were engaged.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 arises from an amendment on Committee Stage to delete the power of the Minister to raise the school leaving age by order. This is a consequential amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 10 which would have the effect of removing the requirement that children complete three years post primary education before they leave the formal education system. The evidence of association between disadvantage and poor education is well established. We must have a more demanding statutory scheme to ensure that children remain in education for a longer period. It should be borne in mind that the Bill provides for a variety of measures. It does not necessarily involve a child remaining on in a school setting <Col N="1296" /> as such. A wide range of education and training options is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is poorly drafted. My query is, what provision does the Minister intend to make for a pupil who has not reached the age of 16 but has completed three years of post primary education if he or she decides to drop out once he or she reaches the age of 16? For example, if a child aged fifteen and a half decides to leave school and move onto something else, the Minister is insisting that he or she continues in education for another six or nine months. However, it is not clear what programme will be offered by the Department for the benefit of that child. We do not want to create a vehicle which becomes an obstacle to someone who has made a good decision from their point of view to move onto something else. Will the Minister make provision for short module courses which would be attuned to the needs of a person who is almost 16, has completed the junior cycle and has decided not to continue in school?</P>

      <P>How will I handle such freedom? The Minister in his reply quoted the parliamentary draftsman but he did not address the inconsistency between the draftspersons advising on the Comhairle Bill and those advising on this Bill. If the advice is correct for this legislation, one must assume that a significant sea change took place in the intellectual formation of the draftsman's office when he was informing the Comhairle Bill.</P>
      <P>Area health boards are not health boards for the purposes of the 1970 Act. I remember from when I was a member of a health board that they are set up without the same statutory mandate as the health board proper. The decisions of an area health board must be referred to the board in total. All this has come about with the proposed Eastern Regional Health Authority structures. I am not convinced by the clear line being taken because the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs chose to use a definition similar to the one I propose. I will not waste the time of the House on this, but I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the two uses in Bills from another Department and his Department are inconsistent.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will bear with me for again referring to his predecessor, I understood him to suggest in previous discussions on the Bill that he would consider this amendment for Report Stage. There is a technical error in the provision for regulations. The Bill envisages that regulations may be made but no section gives the power to make regulations. The Bill states that such implementation regulations may happen, but the specification of the power to formulate and initiate the regulations is not included. Therefore, this amendment improves the Bill and makes it clear.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's amendment to mean that it will require all regulations to be made under the Bill to be made under <Col N="1299" /> section 4. I have no objection to that in principle but the Bill, as drafted, already provides for this approach and I am assured by the parliamentary draftsman that that is the case. We went back to the draftsman, as requested, and discussed this point and I am assured it covers it. The Bill as drafted provides that anything to be prescribed by the Minister under the Bill will be done through regulations made under section 4. In other words, the Minister cannot, under the Bill as drafted, make regulations outside section 4. In these circumstances, the Deputy's amendments are unnecessary. The Bill as drafted already covers the point with which the Deputy is concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;recognised alternative education provider' means a provider recognised by the Board as providing a minimum education;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises and defines a recognised school and sets out its obligations, such as maintaining records, developing attendance strategies and responding to the obligations and needs of education welfare as we define it. However, it fails to recognise recognised alternative providers. Many schemes are set up for young people by youth agencies, FÁS and other community organisations which are not recognised schools. Many institutions provide support, training and education for young people, but they are not recognised schools. We should include them in the Bill. Attendance strategies should be developed by such institutions and we should adopt the same inspection and reporting approach to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill recognises that some children are not suited to recognised schools and they will only thrive in other environments, for which it makes provision. However, certain policies should be <Col N="1300" /> developed in those environments and attendance strategies are an important dimension of that. The Educational Welfare Board should be able to follow the progress of a child, even if that child leaves the recognised school structure and moves into unrecognised institutions which are playing a valuable role and have become for many children the only way to develop skills. Many young people who would normally drop out of school are encouraged by the way they are treated outside the recognised school setting. They are recognised as individuals and treated on a par with others.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of us to proceed with a Bill which does not recognise such institutions and outline their obligations and the policies they can pursue. If the Educational Welfare Board is to fulfil its mandate, it will need to stretch its remit to include institutions other than recognised schools. This amendment seeks to include that in the definition of the Bill. I have tabled further amendments to develop obligations and roles for these institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The State does not have a constitutional role where a parent seeks to educate their child outside the recognised school system, except to ensure the child receives a minimum education. The board must work out what that is and how to deal with it. That is the thrust of the Bill in this area. Accordingly, it is not appropriate that the board should recognise certain providers of education and not others. The board will validate the claims of parents to provide their children with a minimum education and shall take action where this does not occur, but it will have no further role. As regards other courses, such as Youthreach, these are regulated and will continue to be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point in introducing a Bill to regulate the way in which we develop an education welfare service for children and then stating that if they stray outside the system and are educated by Youthreach the education welfare service will abandon them because it is now a matter for their parents and the service has no further interest other than to ensure they get a minimum education? There is no point in saying there is no need to develop school attendance strategies. We want to help young people with difficulties to develop and to plan a career structure for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not state that because they are outside the recognised school structure we no longer have an interest in them, want to offer support or expect institutions to develop the type of policies which will support them. I do not see the sense of going to the trouble of setting up a board with expertise and then putting an artificial fence <Col N="1301" /> around it so that if the child strays into Youthreach, that is the end of our role. That is the type of pigeon-holing which has caused difficulties in education. We should provide the same support services to the child which are linked to the child's needs regardless of where they stray in the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister's earlier reference to the State's obligations relating to minimum education. This clashes with some court decisions which dealt with aspects of alternatives to the State schooling system and the phrase used was &ldquo;suitable elementary education&rdquo;. I take it when the Minister said it would be the function of the board to lay down the content of what he referred to as the prescribed minimum education that it would also adequately provide clarity for those exercising a home education option, such as a definition of a &ldquo;suitable elementary education&rdquo;, in order to be consistent with the court's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The function will be to develop and introduce guidelines on minimum education to ensure children do not fall through the system and are not neglected. The Deputy will understand the constitutional position which has been clearly made, namely, that the Minister does not have power to go beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution has been interpreted by the courts in the light of the provision of a &ldquo;suitable elementary education&rdquo; in a best case scenario. Will such prescription and the guidelines that will be developed be able to take account of that definition rather than the other definition which relates to the provision of a &ldquo;minimum education&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This again involves the difference between an elementary and a minimum education, a question with which the guidelines will have to deal. People must be satisfied that those guidelines are adequate. The problem for the State is the possibility that it might go too far in terms of interfering with the right of parents to educate their children outside the system. The guidelines will have to cover the requirement to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in danger of being blinded by the constitutional constraints by which he is bound. If a parent decides that they do not want their child to be educated in the State system, the Minister's only stipulation is to ensure that the child receives a minimum education. However, I am concerned about young people who, for one reason or another, have strayed outside the recognised system, <Col N="1302" /> perhaps into Youthreach or other areas of informal or community based areas of training and education. The Minister is not giving those individuals the same sort of support he plans to provide to children in recognised schools. He is saying that the educational welfare service, in light of the type of supports it is going to develop, will not cater for those children because they attend institutions which are not recognised by the State.</P>
      <P>When responsibility for Youthreach was transferred from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Department of Education and Science a number of years ago, it was in recognition of the fact that the latter Department had expertise across a range of areas which could be of benefit to those involved in the scheme and that it would be better able to develop a coherent policy for Youthreach if responsibility for the scheme was not split between the two Departments. However, the Department of Education and Science, with its new found responsibility for the operation of Youthreach, appears to be saying that it does not intend to extend the benefits which the educational welfare board can bring in terms of the education of children to those involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Department's approach to this issue. It seems that the arguments which make the development of attendance strategies, etc., within schools desirable make them equally desirable within Youthreach or whatever other schemes we sanction to provide education. In addition, the expertise, skills and psychological and other services the educational welfare board will develop in the future should be made available to such institutions to support them in dealing with those children who are often the most difficult to cater for in terms of education provision. I signalled previously that this is a weakness in the Bill and I do not understand why it has been retained.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 10, after &ldquo;emotional,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;cultural, linguistic,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17, which involves the insertion of the term &ldquo;cultural, linguistic,&rdquo; in section 9(1)(<i>a</i>), was recommended by some of the groups which promote cultural and linguistic development in this country. These groups strongly believe &ndash; I agree with them in this regard &ndash; that if the board has a role to play in promoting an appreciation of the benefits to be derived from education this should include promotion of the cultural and linguistic aspects of children's development in addition to their physical, intellectual, emotional, social and moral development.</P>
      <P>The other amendments in my name refer to the need to be alert to the fact that Irish society is becoming multi-cultural and that in the future children will come from different ethnic as well as social backgrounds. When the board is developing policies to promote and foster an environment that encourages children to attend a school and participate fully in the life of that school, it should be conscious of the fact that children come from different social and ethnic backgrounds and that it cannot promote a mono-cultural way of dealing with these issues. It must actively assist schools in dealing with the welfare of children from different ethnic and social backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a widespread belief that the culture of education has developed in such a way that children from certain social backgrounds are of the opinion that it is set up for them to fail. It is important that the educational welfare board's central task is to ensure that this sort of attitude which often develops in schools is dealt with and that the policies it puts in place ensure that chil<Col N="1304" /> dren enjoy success in school and do not find themselves continually failing to reach a standard they have been set which is foreign to them. It is vital that the environment in which people learn is supportive and that is the intention behind the Bill. There is a case that this should be explicitly recognised both in terms of the environment and policies schools will develop with the support and under the direction of the board.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 71 are intended to meet the views expressed on Committee Stage. They are designed to allow for a wide definition of the benefits of education. In general, therefore, I agree with Deputy Bruton's assertion that there is a need to ensure that the education system promotes tolerance and respect for peoples of all cultures. I do not believe it is necessary to go as far as the Deputy proposes, however, particularly in amendments Nos. 87 and 88. The broad statements provided for in my amendments fully meet the needs at issue.</P>
      <P>The education system is based on the premise that children, regardless of their background, should be educated and that their needs must be met. Many children from different cultures are already in schools and, on the evidence of the schools I have visited, they are very happy. Education is currently provided in schools on a multi-cultural basis. Amendment Nos. 18 and 71 are designed to meet the views expressed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>to promote and foster in society, and in particular in families, an appreciation of the benefits to be derived from education, in particular as respects the physical, intellectual, emotional, social, cultural and moral development of children, and of the social and economic advantages that flow therefrom.</P>
      <P>I find the phrase &ldquo;and of the social and economic advantages that flow therefrom&rdquo; quite extraordinary. If, as the Minister stated, we are talking about the education of children, it is somewhat early to be telling children they belong to the economy. Some of us would argue that the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; is actually redundant. The use of the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; is something of a carrier of a utilitarian philosophy which is very recent.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed by the manner in which the Minister has dealt with my amendments on the need to explicitly recognise that children from very different social and ethnic backgrounds are now presenting in our schools in the mandate we are giving to the board. The Minister will be aware of schools in the western suburbs of the city in which up to 60 children who are not even from EU backgrounds are presenting at schools. There will obviously be a growing need to accommodate their needs in the development of an environment within the school such as that envisaged in 9(1)(<i>b</i>) and also to conduct research into the needs and patterns of support required by children.</P>
      <P>The Traveller community is an indigenous ethnic community whose needs are particularly important. Some 80% of Traveller children drop out of or do not attend school and it would be important, when giving the board a mandate to commission research, to explicitly consider the problems facing particular ethnic groups within our communities. The Minister will probably say that section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) is sufficiently general to encompass everything. However, the Oireachtas should send out a signal to the board that evidence already exists that non-attendance is a problem which affects minority groups, notably Travellers. It is very difficult to encourage Traveller children to proceed through the existing education system. That says more about the need to develop a better education system than the interests of Traveller children. This is a very important area and I would like to see it being explicitly recognised in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 87 and 88 deal explicitly with that part of the Bill in which we are providing some relief from the Data Protection Act to allow research to be conducted. It would be worthwhile if some relief from the obligations of that legislation were provided to allow research into school attendance and the needs of children from particular backgrounds. If the board could gain access to certain records which might not normally be released to it, it could develop more coherent research. While respecting the necessity to protect individuals' privacy, I would like to see the National Educational Welfare Board having the necessary flexibility to access data and develop the type of research I have provided for in amendment No. 21. The Minister did not address the needs of my amendment at all in his reply. His amendment will simply result in the addition of the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; to the definition of the possible benefits of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" />
    </P>
    <P>Mr. M. Higgins: I support Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 19 as being of particular importance. Section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) reads:</P>
    <P>to promote and foster, in recognised schools, an environment that encourages children to attend school and participate fully in the life of the school.</P>
    <P>This reinforces the traditional view that children should go to school, something we all agree is a very good thing. However, the difference between the subsection as it stands and the effect of Deputy Bruton's amendment which proposes the insertion of &ldquo;of all social and ethnic backgrounds&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;children&rdquo; is that the amendment would create an expectation of duty in the school to be receptive to difference. There is also a connotation of process in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The most recent census figures on people's affiliations to different religions or belief systems listed 220 Pantheists. There is a huge difference between a general prescription that children should like going to school, something with which we would all agree, and saying that the environment which will be created in the school will be one which will encourage children from all social and ethnic backgrounds.</P>
    <P>There is a prescriptive suggestion in Deputy Bruton's amendment which I like, namely, that the school cannot simply remain a neutral place but must recognise social difference and encompass it in the school's attractive environment. That would be a meaningful policy by which a child could be encouraged to go to school.</P>
    <P>In regard to ethnic and other differences, in the absence of an amendment such as Deputy Bruton's, it may well be that some ethnic groups would begin to make a case to educate themselves separately from the institutionalised system. This has arisen in France. I urge the Minister to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment which would not weaken the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All children are included. The Deputy mentioned the numbers in some of the schools. One I visited has 50 children of the kind to which the Deputy referred from outside the EU and 40 children of the Traveller community. They are all happily integrated, and it is working extremely successfully.</P>
      <P>I know there is much work to be done in this area. The problem is in getting the work done rather than in the powers to do the work. The power is there. It was really encouraging to see how successfully that work is being done in quite a number of schools. It belies what we are hearing publicly about these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other issue of getting children to come to school, there is an interesting experiment in Dublin 17 at which the Deputy attended. He saw how successfully children were being encouraged to come to school through the breakfast scheme. <Col N="1307" /> Whereas the breakfast scheme was intended to help a relatively small number of children, 900 children came for breakfast and kept coming early for breakfast thereafter. Perhaps that is the more appropriate way to address these problems than trying to prescribe in great detail for it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of powers, the broad power is set out in section 27(3)(<i>b</i>)(iii), which refers to the general effectiveness of educational or training programmes. The data may be collected to promote the general effectiveness and, therefore, it is covered in that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I always welcome the Minister visiting my ward to learn about education initiatives. It is in his Dáil constituency. However, he is missing the point. There are successful experiments, many of which are driven by well motivated teachers and principals getting support in that case, as the Minister rightly stated, from both business and the community.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the records show that individual anecdotal evidence of success is belied by the hard data which shows that 80% of children of the Traveller community drop out of school before they reach the second level system. The hard evidence is that this is not working adequately. It would be remiss not to include in the Bill explicit encouragement and direction to the board to take action in these areas.</P>
      <P>Equally, the real danger for the increasing numbers of children from different countries being educated in the system is that they too will face high dropout rates and high levels of non-participation. They will then become victims of unemployment, etc. That is a route down which we cannot afford to go. We must try to nip that in the bud.</P>
      <P>The Educational Welfare Board will be one of the agencies to which we will be looking to do that. It would be a mistake to fail to explicitly set that out in the functions and tasks of the board and I could not have put it more eloquently than Deputy Higgins. It is a supportive measure which we could provide for here. It would be very much in line with what the Minister is trying to achieve with the Bill, it would give explicit legal recognition of this and there would always be a text to which to return. To some extent we are setting a direction for the future. This will be the record of where we want things to go and it will create a momentum over time.</P>
      <P>The Minister is mistaken in not accepting some of these amendments. I concede that amendments Nos. 87 and 88 may be covered, but amendments Nos. 19 and 21 would do no harm to the Bill in the Minister's estimation and could only do good. Does the Minister oppose amendment No. 17?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) to monitor and report upon records of attendance by pupils,</P>
      <P>(<i>f</i>) to develop, in co-operation with schools and the wider community, an early warning mechanism to identify pupils who may be at risk of failing to achieve the prescribed minimum education,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has to do with the general functions of the board. One of its key functions should be that it would monitor and report upon the records of attendance by pupils. There is not regular reporting. We do not know the level of regular non-attendance. Only the OECD report shows that Ireland's non-attendance rates are double those of most continental European countries. It is only from such outside sources that we are getting hard data. The Department of Education and Science has records only relating to an <i>ad hoc</i> sur<Col N="1309" /> vey in the early 1990s. Before that, even though there was a legal obligation on the Department, it did not maintain records. The board should develop and provide detailed reports on attendance and the Bill should state explicitly that the board would report on that.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the idea of an early warning system. Although I accept it is necessary, the Bill provides for quite a bureaucratic system of reporting and recording absences. A certain number of absences will trigger a report to the Educational Welfare Board and we would then hope the board would respond, but we must better anticipate needs. There are many cases where one will be aware for all sorts of different reasons that a child may be at risk. The wrong approach is to wait until that child has built up a record which is so bad that it is signalled to an educational welfare service. We should, where possible, try to develop pro-active policies within schools. The notion of an early warning system with a school being able to alert the board to the likelihood that a certain child will have problems and the need to apply the available support services would be a much better approach than the other one of waiting until the problems may have built up to a point where they are serious and much more difficult to remedy. I would like to see the early warning concept developed rather than making the acceptable level of failure the test. We must anticipate needs. The schools involved in this procedure will be, predominantly, in disadvantaged areas where 25% of children are regularly absent from school and 12% are absent for more than half of the school year. This is the case in parts of your constituency, Sir. These chronic problems will, of course, come to the attention of the board but it must develop early warning mechanisms in schools and put support mechanisms in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, particularly with regard to early warning mechanisms. I am concerned that the exercise, while well meant, could become an exercise in accounting. I recall a teacher showing me an old roll book containing a list of non-attending pupils. I am reminded of the distinction between chartered accountancy and cost accountancy. Chartered accountants prepare accounts when the corporate entity has died or passed on while cost accountancy takes an ongoing view of the process. The House will note that I am shifting my logic into the logic of the market with a view to making it more attractive to those who are moved by such philosophical systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sure the Minister is surprised. Children in trouble can be identified early. I am moved by the concept of children in trouble. I know families in which one brother follows another inexorably into a pattern of non-<Col N="1310" /> attendance. It is not necessary to wait until the third child in a family has established a pattern of non-attendance. It should be possible to identify children in need and to intervene at an early stage. The new system should be an interventionist one rather than one of accounting for casualties at the end of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies are concerned about the bureaucratic and accounting aspects of this measure. Those aspects also concern me. I do not wish to take a bureaucratic approach. The functions set out by Deputy Bruton in his proposed new subsections <i>(e) </i>and <i>(f) </i>are already laid down as specific duties of education welfare officers in section 21.</P>
      <P>I have directly provided for an early warning system in section 21, especially by means of the 20 day absence rule and the six day suspension rule. There is also a more general provision which will allow principals to inform welfare officers where a student displays irregular attandance patterns. It is important to anticipate. I would like the board to establish good relations and links with principals and schools. There is a duty on the board, under section 9(1)<i>(c) </i>and 9(1)<i>(d)</i>, to research this area and to find the best means of working within it.</P>
      <P>The proposals contained in the amendment are well covered and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 refers to a school's obligation to provide for the identification at an early stage of pupils who are at risk of developing school attendance problems. My amendment requires the board to develop such a mechanism. Placing an obligation on a school to do so merely provides one element of support. Placing a similar obligation on the board seems more sensible and more valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the merit in what Deputy Bruton has suggested. A school-based strategy allows for the possibility of people being lost between schools. This already happens in many areas when people move from one school to another. The advantage of placing an obligation on the board to put a strategy in place is that the strategy will be community based and will not be limited to the enrolment of a single school. The scheme could then deal with a catchment area rather than a single school. I see an advantage in that.</P>

      <P>Paragraph <i>(c) </i>deals with the commissioning of research into the reasons for non-attendance and strategies and programmes to prevent it. This puts an onus on the board to develop anticipatory and early interventionist strategies as well as any other strategies which may be necessary. Paragraph <i>(d) </i>obliges the board to disseminate the results of such research to schools and to advise schools on matters relating to the prevention of non-attendance and on <Col N="1311" /> the good conduct of students generally. This function of the board is covered.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be the first to recognise the difference between conducting research into the growing of tomatoes and actually growing the tomatoes and making sure they are grown in every school in the country. Directing the board to conduct research does not place an obligation on it to develop the consequences of that research. We do not need research to tell us that an early warning mechanism is desirable. The Minister is clutching at straws in reverting to those paragraphs to justify his rejection of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The research is to be conducted in order to develop the strategies. The Deputy's reference to growing tomatoes is a good one. That requires anticipation and everything which goes with it. With the small amount of time available to me I cannot explain the matter further, but it would be very interesting. Nutrition and physiology play an important part in the process.</P>

      <P>We had this discussion on Committee Stage when we were giving powers to the board to do certain things. One of the powers was to arrange, with the consent of the parent, for a child to be examined in regard to his or her intellectual, emotional or physical development in order to help develop an effective strategy for that child. My amendment seeks to provide that where a parent requests that this examination occur, it could be considered by the board. The board could, at its own initiative or following a request from a parent, arrange an examination. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would consider that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to create a very open-ended provision for psychological services on demand. I do not believe that is appropriate or, indeed, possible. <Col N="1312" /> The Deputy will be aware that we have already made significant provision for psychological services with the establishment of the national educational psychological service. However, we could not be in a position where any parent at any time could require, as a matter of statutory right, that an examination be carried out. Parents' views will, in practice, be respected. The provision itself provides for their consent to examinations. If a parent has a concern about a child, it will be taken seriously and an examination will be carried out. That, however, is different from requiring the board to respond to every request from a parent for an examination on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Currently every effort is made to provide the psychological service following a request from a parent. We are recruiting large numbers of extra psychologists for this service. The need is being met and will be met, but the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to make it a statutory right. I do not believe that is necessary and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very different view from the Minister. I know statutory rights have to be thought about but this is an area in which we should have statutory rights. There are problems such as dyslexia &ndash; according to Scottish research, 50% of prisoners are dyslexic and this was not identified at an early stage in their career. Attention deficit disorder and other conditions clearly interfere with the child's progress. There should be a statutory right to such an assessment. I admit my amendment, as phrased, does not limit the request in any way. I accept that if we are drafting a statutory right, it should be limited in some way. In the UK where there is such a statutory right, they refer to evidence that a child has special needs and is not making progress. There is some <i>prima facie </i>test before this right is exercisable in law.</P>
      <P>The Minister responded that this would be open-ended. He said that we are doing very well, but that is not the case. Let us be honest about it. Some 60% of children with special needs have had to get private assessments because there is a very long waiting list for public assessments. Recruitment to the psychological service has been painfully slow and difficult. We are not fulfilling the rights of children in this area. We are failing because it is not a legal obligation. Although the Department expresses the view that it would like that to be there, it nonetheless allows a system to persist which is not delivering assessment even to children who have serious needs. We are at the point where legal rights are the issue. There should be legal rights for children whose future careers will be blighted if they do not get access to such assessments in a timely way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a trivial issue, it is a serious one. I acknowledge the Minister said on previous occasions that he will not go down the road of legal rights at this stage. However, if we are talking about an educational welfare service which is <Col N="1313" /> worth anything and we refuse to give a statutory right to children with serious difficulties to some form of assessment at the behest of their parents, we are not being very serious. It goes back to the issue about which we talked earlier, that is, the commitment to resources to make this happen. It is all very vague. If we do not have legal rights and we are not willing to commit resources, we have the recipe for what happened before in this area &ndash; we have all the laws on the Statute Book but nothing with which to butter the spuds at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be entirely practical about this. I support the amendment for practical reasons. The Minister stated that we could have a situation where every parent would automatically request testing for their children. Section 9(4) states that the board &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and I cannot see why that could not be construed as the board exercising discretion so as to avoid any wasteful exercise.</P>
      <P>Turning to the most important point, only the board, with the consent of the parent of the child concerned, has a right to initiate this. Parents have received notes saying their children are unco-operative, bold or whatever. I was at a meeting and I asked all the parents present who had got a note about good behaviour to put up their hand, but no one did because notes usually bring bad news. We will, however, leave that for another day. If the child is described as unco-operative, bold or otherwise, the child has had real difficulties &ndash; perhaps learning or tension difficulties &ndash; which are now only beginning to surface. Let us be frank about that.</P>
      <P>The advantage of an amendment such as this &ndash; I hope Deputy Bruton presses it &ndash; is that the parent knows the child's difficulties more than anybody else. It is not only a school attendance difficulty about which one is talking. Once can observe a child's behaviour in terms of its sleep, behaviour with peers, siblings and other members of the family. Parents have often come to me and I have heard them stand up in court and say they do not know what to do. Would it not be a good thing if the child was hooked into the educational system, creating hope for himself or herself, that the parent in trouble would be able to say that they would like their child tested in relation to an intellectual, emotional or physical development, before anything disastrous happens? It might relate to a relationship with a parent or to the child's image of himself or herself in a bodily sense. If it is initiated by the person who has the most contact with the child, surely everyone benefits. Is it not better to include that? </P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in section 9(4) and if one was flooded by such requests, the board, through the use of that word, has the right to exercise its discretion on how much it can handle. I urge the Minister to seriously consider accepting this amendment which parents, in particular, will welcome.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it is necessary because the power is there do to this and it is happening at the moment. Deputy Bruton is right that the problem is that resources were not applied previously. However, the resources are being applied now under the current programme. I notice the Deputy nodding his head. To appoint staff, one must go through the Civil Service Commission &ndash; one cannot just appoint someone to a Civil Service post. Appointments are currently being finalised through the Civil Service Commission. There is a commitment to go further with that over the next year. It is a question of personnel. The parents communicate with the teachers and the principal. The problem is the numbers of psychologists available. It is being dealt with and the only way it will be addressed is by providing the staff and the people to do the job. They have not been provided in the past, but they will be provided now.</P>

      <P>Year in, year out in discussions on the Estimates we hear about the intention to appoint 25 people. Now we are advised there is one more hurdle to be overcome before they are appointed. The Minister knows that if there was a legal obligation or right it would be done. We have seen the power of legal decisions in education many times. Very recently the Department changed its strategy on children with special needs because of a ruling on legal rights.</P>
      <P>Let us not fool ourselves that the Department is urgently seeking to provide services in this area. It is not happening. Ministers for Finance and others can be as lackadaisical as they like about these issues because there are no statutory obligations placed on them. We need to reverse the rights so that there is a statutory right for parents and children to have these assessments done. They are not happening as any parent of a child will special needs will attest. If the Minster was to give a speech to an annual conference dealing with children with special needs about how we have a service for assessment he would be laughed at.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a start in creating the momentum for change and I urge the Minister to accept it. It would give him far greater leverage in developing the kind of service I know he wants to develop. He has been spectacularly unable to develop it, despite a Government commitment three years ago.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 6, to delete &ldquo;examined&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was one of the poor law residues in national schools in Ireland, exercised at different times when there were crises in relation to public health epidemics that poor children who had not the means of washing were told that they would be taken behind the blackboard to be examined. Health inspectors of different departmental hue would arrive and it was one of the great pedagogic terrors to be examined in school. The word &ldquo;examined&rdquo; in that sense is singularly inappropriate in this legislation. The word &ldquo;assessed&rdquo; is used in most of the humane applied sciences, be it in psychotherapy, psychology, the social sciences or whatever else. I cannot see why the word &ldquo;assessed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;examined&rdquo; should be used here.</P>
      <P>Indeed, examination is not possible because there is no precision about the provision. Section 9(4) states: &ldquo;The Board may, with the consent of the parent of the child concerned, arrange for a child to be examined . . .&rdquo;. Does this mean poked at or set upon? What does it mean? It does not fit into the section. It is more likely that the Minster will want to replace the word &ldquo;examined&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;. We can then quickly dispose of this anachronism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Higgins. Reference to children and their special needs is always to child assessments &ndash; psychological assessment and assessment of their emotional well being. The use of the word &ldquo;examine&rdquo; would send the wrong signal, saying to parents that there was something irregular happening and the child was, therefore, coming under examination. It would have all the wrong connotations. By contrast, we have reached the position where parents recognise that a child should be assessed if they are exhibiting any difficulties. We should be careful in legislation to use phrases that are supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to change the terminology used where the board arranges for the consideration of a child's physical, emotional or intellectual development. The Deputy proposes that this be an assessment. The Bill provides for an examination. It provides for the board to arrange to carry out examinations, under section 10, and assessments, under section <Col N="1316" /> 15. These are intended to be two separate and distinct events aimed at different groups. The examination in section 10 is to provide for situations where, for example, the welfare board is considering how to provide for a child who has been expelled from school and is thought to have psychological problems. An examination might be necessary to assist the board in planning for the future provision for such a child.</P>
      <P>An assessment under section 15 refers specifically to a situation where a child is being educated outside the recognised school system and the board wishes to ensure that the child is receiving a minimum education. The Deputy will appreciate that these are very different situations. In the latter the board acts to vindicate the constitutional rights of each child to receive a minimum education. This is a non-judgmental, factual assessment. In the former case, a situation has arisen where a child has experienced significant problems in his or her education and remedial action is necessary to assist the child. The effect of the Deputy's amendments would be to cause confusion as to these two different events. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that has caused confusion is the Minster's reply. He suggests that assessment should be confined to section 15. If he wants to use assessment in section 15, then as they say in Connemara &ldquo;away leat&rdquo;. That is fine. However, I never argued, nor did he until now, that because the word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; is used in section 15 its use is inappropriate in section 10.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed the amendment. The issue is concerned with the appropriateness of the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; in section 10. The Minister's defence of his position is that because assessment is used for non-school options in section 15 the word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; cannot be used as a substitute for the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; in section 10. This is nonsense. On what basis would an examination be carried out? The Minister has identified a delinquent syndrome covering the person who may have been expelled from school. I can envisage a situation in such circumstances where a teacher tells a parent that the child will not be examined but assessed. It means that the Bill is stuck with the resonance of the word &ldquo;examine&rdquo;&ndash; examine by what procedure and for what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the most pathetic defence to say that we are using &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; in a limited context for non-school options in section 15 so, therefore, we cannot consider its appropriateness in section 10. Tough luck. The Minister should redraft section 10 properly. I cannot accept that if one puts in &ldquo;Assessment&rdquo; with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; in section 15, one cannot use this term in any other section of the Bill. Bad drafting is the problem. If the Minister does not accept this amendment, I will press it and I also intend to call a division on it. I regard this word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; in such circumstances as that serious that it contravenes every principle that we are trying to apply relating to, for <Col N="1317" /> example, children in difficulty or in trouble. That is all we have and whether the children are expelled, they are still in trouble. We are going to use the language of assessment. I will not accept the use of language such as &ldquo;we had your child examined&rdquo;. I am beginning to think that this is worse than an anachronism.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply has created immense problems for me because in section 15, when we come back to it, he argues for an inconsistent interpretation of the needs of children, between the ones that arise under the section 10 process and the section 15 process. I will press the amendment.</P>

      <P>the Board may, with the consent of the parent of the child concerned, arrange for the child to be examined as to his or her intellectual, emotional and physical development (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;an examination&ldquo;) by such a person as may be determined by the Board with the concurrence of the parent.</P>

      <P>My intention with the liaison officer is to provide a network of communication at a senior level within all the institutions concerned with the issue of non-attendance to fulfil an early warning, co-ordinating and information sharing function. Through this network, the agencies involved can work more effectively at local level. My intention is that a senior member of the welfare board should participate in this network and disseminate information as appropriate throughout the education welfare officer structure. However, at local level, I expect that the local education welfare officer would be in close contact with the relevant health board, Garda authorities and other concerned bodies to allow for an integrated approach to local problems.

That may be his reasonable expectation, but the whole purpose of the amendment was to specify that there would not be a health board without a mechanism such as he has described. As to whether it is necessary to provide for this minimum representation in statute, the Minister seems confident that it can be met.

      <P>&ldquo;(7) A person designated under this section may request the Board to convene a meeting of relevant designated officers to assess the needs of a child who has particular attendance problems.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liaison is a two way process. If a liaison system is to be put in place it seems that persons designated as liaison officers who will liaise regularly with the National Educational Welfare Board should have the power of initiative where it comes to their attention that a child has particular attendance problems. Under the amendment such a person would be able to request the convening of a meeting to assess the needs of the child concerned. I am referring to local rather than high level national liaison committees. It is important where a juvenile liaison officer or a health board social worker can see a problem emerging in a family and is of the view that there is a need for a co-ordinated response that it will not be left to the National Educational Welfare Board to convene a meeting. It should be a dual process whereby a meeting may be triggered by a social worker. The problem in the co-ordination of services is that, although different bodies agree to participate, their commitment is less than full. If it was a two way process it would be much more likely that the different bodies would buy into it if they could have their agendas addressed where they identify families in need. The amend<Col N="1321" /> ment would complement what the Minister has in mind in relation to local liaison.</P>

The Minister seems to be of the view that the educational welfare officer will be in entire possession of the best information and will take the initiative, but that is not the way things happen in reality. One is much more likely to receive the co-operation of the different agencies if one is willing to state that one does not possess all knowledge and that they, too, may trigger a case conference where they identify a problem.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Bruton. I fail to see how the amendment would weaken or interfere with the Bill in any way. There may be good intentions but it is far better to build them into legislation. I have served on many school boards during the years. The most horrifying case <Col N="1322" /> a board can deal with is the possible expulsion of a child. In such a case the principal would give a full report on the behavioural problems of the child in question over a long period. In many instances if there had been liaison at an early stage between the Garda Síochána, the school and the health service, the children concerned would never have reached the stage where the board was faced with their expulsion. Unfortunately, many of these children end up in St. Patrick's institution or Mountjoy jail. Early intervention is required when young children experience problems in the home or at school. I support this amendment because a child's life can be destroyed because of a lack of proper liaison at the most crucial time. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. It will not damage the legislation but merely states what should happen in law. We are here to make certain that we express in legislation the concern that this sort of liaison should occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree this amendment specifies a trigger mechanism? He may reply by saying this will happen automatically but it does not happen now and it will not happen in the future. This amendment is based on practice in other countries that involves people working in different areas, such as health, education, social welfare, justice, juvenile liaison and so on. We are not suggesting that people convene fortnightly or monthly conferences to discuss individual cases but that those monitoring particular cases can trigger the mechanism concerning a child's needs. This means a person will be able to trigger an intervention strategy in which parent, child and those responsible give their consent.</P>
      <P>The argument is whether the people specified take on a responsibility and there will be occasions when they will take the initiative. The only alternative, which is becoming tiresome at this stage, is to suggest that the administration will be so perfect that it will be impossible not to cater for a child's needs. With the best will in the world that can never be the case. Things happen in different areas of the community of which people will be aware. There may be a family conflict or other reasons. The best way to help a child in such a situation is for a person to ask for the case to be considered. I support this amendment which proposes a pro-active instrument for delivering the care the Bill intends.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's response. If we go to the trouble of setting up a liaison system, which is very important, there is no point in setting up a sterile system which is <Col N="1323" /> solely driven by the educational welfare officer being all-seeing and wise and convening this group. All the Bill does is to stipulate that if the board requests records about a child those records will have to be delivered. This will impose an obligation on people to provide necessary records to the educational welfare officer. However, this runs the risk of being an extremely sterile liaison process which will not breathe real life into the notion of co-ordinating responses and being pro-active in identifying families with difficulties.</P>
      <P>We will have a more meaningful system if, from the outset, we accept that liaison is a two-way process and that all the agencies and the community which become involved have powers of initiative and are equal partners, and that they have a right to trigger a response if they identify problems. This is already happening successfully in some communities where there is co-ordination. It should not be a top-down mechanism controlled by one group which has all the powers of initiative and powers to demand records. That is not how things work in practice. The process has to be founded on confidence and mutuality among the different groups and that is what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>The Minister can benefit only by giving this right. There is no point in having an elaborate liaison structure if, at the end of the day, the parties do not want to be there and are not willing to put their resources behind what is going on in the committee. Such a scenario will be just one more drag on social workers and others who are already very busy. We have to create an environment where this system is seen to work for all the participants. This is important as we have seen many such integrated service initiatives fail because relationships were not properly structured at the beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Board shall endeavour to establish a liaison network at local level which shall also involve those involved in education and other relevant community groups to promote coherent and consistent support to pupils, parents and schools.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure the liaison structure will be not just some super board set up at national or regional level which is remote from schools and parents. If the liaison structure is to work it has to use local social workers, local juvenile diversion officers and people who work in the community. There are many active community groups who are willingly supporting schools, whether by way of homework clubs, out of school activities or what could be described as home-school liaison work. There are many such <Col N="1324" /> groups, particularly in the partnership areas, and it is important that the liaison structure, spelt out in great detail by the Minister, does not become remote from problems on the ground but is available in local areas and is seen to be able to deliver co-ordinated responses to families.</P>
    <P>This is why I have proposed there should be a liaison network at local level. It is important to establish this principle as many good initiatives are in place which have not been given statutory recognition. The Bill proposes a top-down development of education welfare, ignoring the fact that there are many active community groups doing great work involving early warning systems with schools and local support networks. We need to recognise and support these initiatives and ensure the model is copied to the benefit of other communities. This is an important dimension which should be recognised statutorily, rather than receiving fairly bland assurances from the Minister that it will happen on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor told us we would have county education committees which would do all sorts of things at county level. This never happened. If we do not include a statutory element, local liaison may again fail to happen.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support this amendment, particularly in the context of schools in disadvantaged areas where poverty exists. Social problems are particularly acute there as a result of poverty. The amendment applies to schools everywhere because this happens informally in schools in areas with more resources. However, with regard to schools in working class communities where deprivation exists and where this is reflected in terms of the attendance of pupils and other acute problems, the encouragement of liaison groups that bring together community organisations, parents and teachers should be put on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>From my experience, for example, in the Blakestown and Mountview area, an existing parent/teacher liaison group deals particularly with the problems associated with the fact that non-attendance is higher in some schools in the area than their equivalents in well off areas which have more resources. The Minister and Government should support parents, teachers and voluntary organisations in the community who would gladly work together in relation to the resourcing of activities outside the school curriculum.</P>
      <P>They would play a vital role in getting to grips with problems in the community that give rise to children being at a disadvantage from an early age. I am particularly concerned about the disadvantage of higher non-attendance in some sections of the community which are harder hit by economic deprivation than others. I hope education welfare officers will be appointed sooner rather than later and that they will be a further support with regard to coming to grips with some of the problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. I have an idea that the Minister wishes to be a reforming Minister for Education and Science. If that is to be the case, the concept of the school in the community must be changed. People can talk about this issue until the cows come home but, at present, many schools and teachers are perceived as having a relationship with the Department where, at a certain time in the late afternoon, doors start to be closed, lights are turned off, playgrounds are emptied and parents get on with their role, which involves the delivery and collection of children, while an immense security problem arises across the sweep of the country. There are a few variations on that theme involving the participation of parent/teacher councils which I support.</P>
      <P>However, I want liaison to work locally because if one wants to go into a school after closing time, one is told that Church &amp; General would require a special policy to cover whatever activity one wants to organise. Children go to bushes and fields where they drink cider or Buckfast and the gardaí drive around in their cars and tell them to move on. They warn them once or twice and the next thing is that they are all down in the station. The children are told that they gave lip to the gardaí, their parents are alerted and they contact their local Deputies. This is what is happening on the ground.</P>
      <P>I regularly meet people involved in this and it is an outrage in places where there are no community, arts, recreation centres or skating rinks that State property becomes a security risk in the evening. Schools are part of the community and it is vital that this area is considered differently. The school should be viewed as part of the community, an institution which tries to help other institutions and not one which responds only to the Department. I wish the Minister well but many wonderful people have lost their intellectual lives in such Departments. If, as the amendment suggests, coherent and consistent support for pupils, parents and schools is to be promoted, the education welfare system needs liaison.</P>
      <P>When the Garda Commissioner has stopped all his PR exercises, he might explain to the House why it is necessary for so many children to be in Garda stations so often. I will return to this subject, but we should try to make the community work. If a chief liaison officer is appointed to deal with another liaison officer, it will lead to sections talking to each other, but people on the ground may not talk to each other. The purpose of the amendment is to make liaison happen locally in the community in so far as it envisages a new deal in schools. However, it would be better to leave schools open all night instead of the current situation where young children are in communities with no facilities. Ireland is one of the worst countries in Europe in this regard. Britain, for example, provides skating rinks and other facilities. Our approach is to round up children, bring them to police stations and suggest they are a threat to public order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. We live in an age where the European Union is developing and there is much talk about the principle of subsidiarity. The amendment is an attempt to introduce subsidiarity at local level. Our system of local government is not working &ndash; it is not local government in the real sense. The amendment would provide proper local government in terms of educational facilities, curriculum development, sporting development and physical education. These and other good developments could take place if State properties were made available to community groups which do not work against the institutions of the State. These people give much of their time on a voluntary basis and put in much effort to help their local communities.</P>
      <P>The amendment is carefully worded. It states that the board shall endeavour to establish a liaison network; it does not go any further. I presume the Minister will accept the amendment because there is no justifiable or logical reason not to accept it. Despite what people might think, there is still large scale unemployment in many areas of my constituency because many people are not skilled for the type of jobs that are available. There may be a culture where nobody in the home has ever worked. A child could be asked to do homework in a home where music might be blaring and the family is living in overcrowded conditions. Due to housing problems, the child's sister might be living there with her child or two children and her partner. There is no opportunity for the pupil to study. That is the reality on the ground.</P>
      <P>However, the schools are locked when perhaps, with proper liaison as suggested in the amendment, members of the community who have taken early retirement, etc. would supervise homework on a voluntary basis and perhaps give a little extra help in their community, which will benefit everybody.</P>
      <P>There is no point complaining about vandalism unless we do something practical to prevent it. People who would have spent a great deal of time promoting sport after school no longer do so because of the absence of religious orders in educational institutions. This means school facilities are available and could be used to promote sport and physical education. One good thing about sport is that, if people are involved in it, they do not have time to get into trouble. It is also good for people and should be part of their education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point about which I feel strongly is the curriculum, because it means nothing to some children and they do not relate to it. In discussing education, we should concentrate on education in a broad sense. Community groups which work with local people, hear their needs and receive feedback could introduce extra curricular activities or amend the curriculum to make it more meaningful to the children to whom we refer. As Deputy Higgins rightly said, there is a feeling that everything is handed down from the top, that there is a person or people in the Department of <Col N="1327" /> Education and Science who know better than the rest of us about what is good for children attending school. There are many people in the community who are capable of assisting us to develop a system whereby we will no longer witness the scandal of children leaving school illiterate, without skills for work and perhaps ending up in trouble because of frustration.</P>
    <P>The amendment cannot damage the legislation. It states:</P>
    <P>The Board shall endeavour to establish a liaison network at local level which shall also involve those involved in education and other relevant community groups to promote coherent and consistent support to pupils, parents and schools.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how that could interfere with what the Minister is trying to establish in the legislation. It can only benefit it. I strongly urge him to accept the amendment and show that debate in this Chamber means something. If a person makes a sensible point, then we should amend the legislation. It is not a defeat for the Government if it accepts an Opposition amendment. This is the way in which legislation should be developed and I sincerely hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the manner in which the Minister for Education and Science is handling the issue and addressing the various relevant and related matters. I congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, on tabling the amendment being discussed. I wholeheartedly support the importance of the Educational Welfare Board endeavouring to ensure that work will be done in close co-ordination with communities at local level. It is important that those who are the education providers in our communities are a vital component of local community spirit. Does the board have the authority or power to set up such a network or can it be encouraged to do so? I would be surprised if the Minister were not to encourage it to do so. I concur with the sentiments of the amendment and the previous speaker's comments on it. Perhaps we should give the Minister an opportunity to respond and see what can be done to ensure the participation of that important and vital ingredient of our community, namely, local education providers and those associated with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputies about the importance of a school working within its environment and having the support of all the different people who live there. We can see it happening and, where it happens, it is excellent and works well. Deputy Joe Higgins mentioned some of the disadvantaged areas where there are special problems and I accept that. However, there is great liaison and support throughout the country. I have visited a number <Col N="1328" /> of schools throughout the country and I will visit many more during summer. There is great support and involvement with parents within communities and, where it exists, it overcomes many of the problems, so it is necessary.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 38, the activity to which the Deputy refers is something I would expect to occur in the normal course of the work of liaison officers, specifically education welfare officers. Such officers will be assigned to a school or a group of schools and will be the means by which the board exercises its functions at local level. These functions include providing supports to parents and students. I see no advantage in imposing a legislative requirement of the type now proposed. The objective of the amendment should be allowed to develop through the interaction which is bound to occur between the board and other agencies rather than through a legislative requirement which could all too easily result in more bureaucracy and less service to the people who need it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callely asked if the board has certain powers. The board has the power to co-operate with groups locally and that is provided in section 9. The board is empowered to co-operate with all these relevant groups. In section 22, schools are empowered to co-operate with local groups to provide a more comprehensive and holistic education. In addition, the Educational Welfare Board will include a representative of the community and voluntary sector. That is provided for under the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness. These are important structures designed to meet the needs as set out and seen by Deputies. It is preferable to give people the power to do it and to then provide it through the system of management. It is not helpful to legislate for each of the sectors and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am profoundly disappointed by the Minister's reply. The wishes of the House in this area are clear. The evidence of experience proves that this type of co-operation and liaison does not happen spontaneously. The Northside Partnership has done tremendous work in education in my area which would never have happened had there not been an obligation to establish that type of network. It has brought together a large number of schools which are co-operating and the community is involved. It has a small amount of money to promote activities which make a difference to people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an obligation. A provision existed which established a network, namely, the Northside Partnership, which meant that it suddenly became possible to do certain things. With £10 million for education spread across all partnership boards in the country, those boards have done more to drive innovation in the <Col N="1329" /> education system than the Department has done in years with its budget of £3 billion. Local networks make a difference. Not only can they add value by having community people doing things voluntarily, they also have a way of looking at problems which is in tune with local needs. The Department or the Educational Welfare Board, even with a community representative, will not have the reach to design local responses to local needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The drafting of the Bill to place the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum on a statutory basis is at an advanced stage. These bodies will be located within an office for National Economic and Social Development, as I indicated on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which has been recently negotiated, it has been agreed that the National Centre for Partnership and Performance will also be located within the proposed office for National Economic and Social Development. Discussions with IBEC and ICTU on the detailed arrangements to be put in place to give effect to the strengthened institutional structures required are taking place and proposals will be submitted shortly. Following on from this process, the parliamentary draftsman's office will be asked to incorporate amendments relating to the NCPP into the draft legislation. It is still expected that the Bill will be published this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. This Bill is a year late but I accept its drafting has probably been delayed because of the decision to include the NCPP in it. However, there is not a substantial drafting load in the Department of the Taoiseach. Is the Taoiseach aware of the concerns of the social partners about the possible loss of independence of the NCPP and that it is essential <Col N="1330" /> that when incorporated into this office, away from its current location in the Department of the Taoiseach in Government Buildings, the structure of the board of the NCPP will be autonomous in terms of the Executive of the day? Does the Taoiseach share the view that if partnership is to take on a life of its own and be advocated and implemented in all sectors of our economy, it is essential that the NCPP be seen as an independent and autonomous body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share that view. Deputy Quinn knows that when he raised on a number of occasions the question of whether they should be in the Department of the Taoiseach because of their independent role, I said it was a matter for the organisations. If they are to have the advantage and the drive to influence companies to consider and adopt best practice and the new range of ideas on which they have worked, to deepen partnership arrangements through deliberation, consensus, discussion and the dissemination and monitoring of information, they need to be independent. I will ensure that remains the case. I discussed it directly with IBEC and ICTU representatives during the partnership discussions to ensure that what was happening was not at variance with what they wanted to do. That is the right way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one could characterise or present the National Centre for Partnership and Performance as the pro-active component of our industrial relations system as distinct from the reactive component, which is the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court? In other words, we have the institutions of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court when there is a breakdown in the operation but we have the National Centre for Partnership and Performance to promote best practice. If the Taoiseach accepts that characterisation, will he further accept that the NCPP should have an autonomy not dissimilar to that of the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will retain its independence. As regards the three organisations working together, in the new national agreement the Government and the social partners agreed a new framework to further improve enterprise partnership and the organisations' capability and performance and to do all the things I mentioned. They built and structured many new ideas under Partnership 2000. The Deputy is correct that it is a pro-active component. They recently produced an excellent video of what has been achieved in recent years and it is now being used for shop stewards, employers and managers. This small group of people has done a great deal in the past three years, including case studies. I do not want to do anything to affect their independence. Continuing progress in all these areas is essential to maintaining our competitive advantage while, at <Col N="1331" /> the same time, implementing the strategic changes they have identified.</P>
      <P>The three organisations, which are not the same but complementary, will be in the same office in the same building and they will be able to use the administration and research facilities, but they will retain their independence as three separate bodies. NESC will continue to provide the strategic analysis which has given us national agreements in the past 12 or 13 years, NESF will continue monitoring initiatives which take account of social partnership and unemployment schemes and deal with the disadvantaged and the marginalised and NCPP will continue to develop partnership arrangements in a pro-active way.</P>

It will continue to monitor the value of the schemes that have been established, indicate which schemes should be co-ordinated and ensure that consideration is given to the 25 new areas of disadvantage.

I refer here to women in the home, who were adversely affected by this year's budget, and the elderly. Neither of these groups are represented in the social consensus.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I are talking about two different things. The legislation deals with the NESF, the NESC and the NCPP. It has nothing to do with the four pillars of the social partnership process. I answered a question on that matter last Wednesday and I stated that the <Col N="1332" /> organisations to which the Deputy referred should consult the relevant pillar. If they obtain acceptance &ndash; I am sure they will if they pursue it &ndash; they could seek membership as long as the balance between the pillars is not changed. They are the organisations of social partnership; they do not involve the staff of the three organisations catered for by the legislation. It is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What provision will be made for increasing the representation of some organisations or reducing the representation of others where changes occur in the demographic composition of particular groups or where new economic interests come into existence which require representation? Does the Taoiseach agree that economic development and social partnership are dynamic not static processes? Does he further agree that the precedent of vocationalism as contained in the electoral college for the Seanad is an example of rigidity and is out of date? For example, there are bodies which barely exist which retain nominating rights in that area which cannot or have not been stripped of them while three other organisations that would be entitled to hold nominating rights have not been granted them because there is no effective means to change levels of representation.</P>
      <P>Given that the NESC and the NESF are being placed on a statutory footing which will create a certain rigidity in term of their structures, what arrangements will be made to alter the balance of organisations involved in the partnership process? What mechanisms will be put in place to remove organisations which are no longer in operation and include new organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That can happen at any stage. Under the legislation, provision can be made by order to institute changes. For example, the composition of the NESC, which has five representatives from each of the four social partnership pillars, five representatives from Government Departments and five independent members, could be changed by order. The composition of the NESF has changed since it was first established. That organisation has 15 representatives from the Oireachtas, five representatives from each of the business, trade union and farming pillars, 15 representatives from non-Government organisations, five representatives from Government Departments, five representatives from local government and five independent members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton is correct in assuming that someone may state that perhaps the composition of these bodies should change or that new groups should be included. Provision would have to be made in the legislation for making a simple order to introduce such changes, which would not fundamentally alter the tasks or terms of reference of these bodies. Deputy Bruton raised this matter on a number of occasions and I have informed the parliamentary draftsman and those respon<Col N="1333" /> sible for developing the legislation to avoid creating a rigid system.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for a number of reasons other than questions of staff permanency and the sustainability of the organisations involved that the legislation should be introduced. However, I do not want the legislation to be so rigid that nothing will ever change. I accept that the NESC has not changed but the composition of the NESF has changed from what was originally envisaged. The chairperson of the NESF, Maureen Gaffney, has put forward many imaginative proposals which have all been taken on board. The composition of the NCPP has changed under the two most recent programmes. This shows that as each programme is completed, the models are extended and developed. This happened in other countries with social partnership models. The Nordic countries have employed social partnership models since the early 1950s and these have changed with the passage of time.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach should consider the example of France which created the Conseil Économique et Social and located its headquarters in a huge office building which I have had the opportunity to visit. The Conseil, which is recognised not only in legislation but also in the French Constitution, does absolutely nothing and is utterly useless.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that including something in legislation puts a hex on it. I do not favour rendering the proposed single body into legislation. The NESC and the NESF are working well, they are not broken and there is no need to fix them. However, if the social partners want them to be amalgamated, I suppose the Taoiseach is obliged to agree with their request. I see no added value in introducing the legislation in question.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton has made it clear that he does not favour this course of action. However, at the end of 1998, I answered questions in the House regarding the lack of staff in the NESC. Members of the Deputy's party complained that they were transferred to an answering machine on each occasion they contacted the NESC because there were no staff to answer telephones. At that stage, no one wanted to work with an organisation which employed staff on a contract basis with no possibility of permanency.</P>

      <P>It might assist the drafting of the legislation, which is over one year late, if we clarified a number of points. Do I take it that, as would be the case with similar legislation placing non-statutory boards or councils &ndash; the composition of which include representative members &ndash; on a statutory footing, one or other of the Schedules to the legislation would name and identify the bodies that will be component parts of that board or council? Do I understand that a mechanism for selecting or deselecting, adding or substracting possible new members to the NESC, where there have been changes of membership over time, or the NESF would be created? That would enable the legislation to address the problem to which Deputy Bruton referred by creating a mechanism to take away members who are no longer considered pertinent and to add new ones. Presumably the legislation provides for that.</P>

      <P>Such issues are normally dealt with by way of regulation. We do not want a situation to arise where it will be necessary to amend legislation. I do not accept that the legislation is a year late. Under the work on Partnership 2000, the social partners wanted to review their achievements at the end of the period and consider how they could best deal with the NCCP. They have done that successfully. It is important for the staff that this issue is dealt with; it is not possible to keep good people in these positions if the appointments are not made on a statutory basis. People will merely leave and take up full-time jobs, now more than ever before.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's action plan for the development of the information society in Ireland was launched in January 1999. The plan covers a number of areas such as infrastructure, legislation, <Col N="1336" /> electronic public services, access, etc. and mandates Departments and agencies to undertake specific tasks to ensure quick adoption of the plan.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the plan, major initiatives are under way. The provision of broadband connectivity to Europe and the US is well advanced with bandwidth being sold on to the private sector. Work is also under way on providing broadband infrastructure to the regions and significant funding has been allocated to this in the national development plan. The Electronic Commerce Bill which will give a legal framework to e-commerce transactions is currently before the Oireachtas and should be enacted later this month or next month.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently running e-business initiatives to raise awareness of e-commerce among SMEs and the joint Information Society Commission/ IBEC awareness initiative for the business community recently concluded. Initiatives to increase awareness among the general public include a television series on technology, aimed at those wary of technology, which recently started on RTE. The Information Society Commission recently published a report entitled IT Access for All which contains recommendations to enable universal participation in the information age. Arising from this, an interdepartmental group has been established to draw up an access strategy.</P>
    <P>Pilot projects on the electronic delivery of public services have commenced with the FÁS on-line job resource for job seekers and employers and the Land Registry on-line service. Work is in progress on the Revenue On-line Service, ROS, for processing tax returns. The Government recently approved a framework for the delivery of integrated electronic public services and decided that each Department should prepare a strategy for the development of such services. The recent appointment of a director and deputy director of REACH will facilitate its task of designing e-public service delivery systems around life and business events. The Government recently authorised commencement of an e-Cabinet project to bring the benefits of new technologies to the Cabinet process and a dedicated information society fund has been established with funding of £30 million this year. To date, over £16 million has been committed to 38 projects through the fast track evaluation process to facilitate quick start-ups.</P>
    <P>A second progress report on the action plan was published in July 1999 and a third report was published in April. The action plan and progress reports are available on the e-Ireland page of my Department's website.</P>
    <P>Development of a departmental intranet is well advanced and is due to be brought into operation before the summer. The intranet project involves the presentation of information resources <i>via </i>web technologies. The intranet will form the basis for a redesign of my Department's website to improve its utility. The redesign will also incor<Col N="1337" /> porate the public sector website guidelines which I launched last November; a more customer focused/user friendly site and will add value to existing information and service provision. I expect that the new website will be in place before the autumn.</P>
    <P>The number of e-mails received through my departmental website varies considerably from week to week. However, on average between 25 and 40 e-mails are received. My Department has registered a number of domain names relating to its activities over the past few weeks and other Departments have been encouraged to do the same in relation to names relevant to their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>In regard to the domain names &ldquo;thetaoiseach.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;bertieahern.com&rdquo; already registered by third parties, my Department is engaged in consultations with other concerned Departments and the Office of the Attorney General on the most appropriate strategies to deal with the problem. The possibility of availing of the ICANN, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, arbitration procedure is also being examined in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has provided a very comprehensive reply. I welcome the fact that the Government has built on the initiative taken by the previous Government, particularly by the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton. As the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is in the House, perhaps he could assist the Taoiseach in answering my question. Is the Taoiseach aware that the planning and development process is one of the most information unfriendly areas in our society, through no fault of anyone in the House? If people wish to view proposals for planning applications which they have seen on site or in the newspapers, it is very difficult for them to do so.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what plans are envisaged to make planning information available on an electronic basis? Many drawings for buildings above a certain scale are done on the CAD electronic formatting system and could be made available to people for inspection. Will the Taoiseach indicate the Government's views on this issue having regard to the massive increase in the volume of construction work being carried out at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has been of great assistance in providing resources to allow Departments to identify and implement projects. We will see a great deal of progress in many areas before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning process is a big area and the electronic system is at an advanced stage. A pilot scheme is under way to consider planning in Counties Meath, Kildare and Donegal. The work carried out in respect of these three counties will eventually be carried out nationwide and the resources will be available to do that. I understand it is intended to put three dimensional <Col N="1338" /> drawings on the Internet as part of these pilot projects. The Planning and Development Bill provides that all planning submissions will be dealt with electronically. I hope that type of work can be done across a range of areas.</P>
    <P>The electronic system is well advanced in the Land Registry, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue On-line Service will certainly be active by the autumn. All Departments have been asked to identify particular areas in their strategies and they have already received the go-ahead to use the consultants to implement their strategies. I will be disappointed if a significant proportion of departmental services are not available on-line by the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will be able to carry out their entire workload &ndash; submissions, returns, records, payments, etc. &ndash; electronically under the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction of Internet access costs comprised one of the aspects of the plan. Is it not the case that Internet access costs in Ireland are at the higher end of the scale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are still at the higher end of the scale although broadband connectivity will dramatically change that by the end of this year or perhaps by the end of the summer as the global crossing network is fed throughout the country. We will have 15 times the capacity we had a year ago at one tenth of the cost.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by international experts that it will be possible to reduce costs even further through competition. A second company has already signed up and a third is at discussion stage. Over the coming 12 months, we will see real competition which will result in costs being driven down even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that one of the objectives of the strategy was that everybody would have an e-mail address? Will he indicate the progress in this regard? I understand that the commission has published a report and the Government's response was to set up an interdepartmental committee to consider the report. Would he agree that decisions should be taken on this subject and that if the Information Society Commission has made recommendations, they should be acted upon rather than referred to another committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Society Commission gave a list of measures on how we can get everybody to take part in the information society. We are committed to ensuring that everybody can reap the benefits of the information society. On the kind of steps which the com<Col N="1339" /> mission put to us and which we have implemented already, the report, IT Access for All, which was mentioned already, provides a framework for ensuring that nobody is excluded from the benefits. An interdepartmental group was drawn up to produce an access strategy which will include provisions to facilitate access by everybody. Regarding disadvantaged groups, this year it is hoped to build on the Net Day project, which took place last autumn. There is the television series to which I referred. Free access has been made available in public libraries and kiosks are being installed in social welfare offices to allow clients access <i>via</i> the Internet. There is an enormous amount of resources being committed to the ICTs in education. In libraries, the number of PCs connected to the Internet has increased from 150 at the beginning of the year to 1,000 at present. There is the FÁS job service on-line. There is a pilot e-procurement scheme in three of the local authorities in addition to what I mentioned earlier regarding the planning services. Therefore, most of the work set out in the report has been implemented.</P>
      <P>I am unsure about the progress which has been made regarding the provision of an e-mail address for everybody, but the commission, in its efforts to involve everyone, has undertaken programmes in the county enterprise areas. We tried to move immediately on all the projects the commission has put to me. I am conscious of what has been said in the House on a number of occasions &ndash; that we make sure that, regardless of where they are located, all community schemes, schemes for the disadvantaged, State schemes and schools have access to the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding access in schools to the Internet, is it the case that a considerable sum has been spent on the training of teachers and many teachers have taken training, but there is a problem that there are not enough computers in the schools, that many schools have maybe only one telephone line and, therefore, only one person can be on the Internet at any one time in those schools and that the State has not provided the schools with sufficient hardware to get any meaningful return from the investment in the training which was taken up with great enthusiasm by the teaching profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in possession of all the facts on education, but I know that all the schools have access to the Internet. An enormous number of schools have computer rooms and PCs. It is true that not all of them have enough lines, but the hardware has been provided in a large number of schools with the help not only of the Government but of the computer companies, who have been helpful in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that it is much more difficult to acquire a &ldquo;.ie&rdquo; domain name than a &ldquo;.com&rdquo; address? What does he intend to do about that? It is clear that one need simply provide a credit card number to acquire a &ldquo;.com&rdquo; domain name but it is much more difficult to acquire a &ldquo;.ie&rdquo; domain name through UCD. That needs to be addressed. What does he intend to do about that?</P>
      <P>Does he agree that integrating the television and the PC is probably the only way to allow disadvantaged groups access to Internet technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's second question, the library and community services are the way of doing that. Net Day, which was run for only a few weeks, proved very successful. People were surprised at the level of interest of not only people in disadvantaged areas, who were familiar with this because of the FÁS and community enterprise schemes, but also the elderly. There was enormous interest in training among the elderly, and the library service is the best way to address that because statistics show that the elderly are strong supporters of the library services.</P>
      <P>I do not know the resolution to the Deputy's first query. The difference is that a &ldquo;.com&rdquo; domain can be registered by anybody, as I know to my expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a penny, although I gather it has gone away. The &ldquo;.ie&rdquo; domain names are only given to individuals and that is why the procedure is tighter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that recently many of us had ISDN lines installed at home? Is he aware that the cost of installation of these lines is in excess of £300 and the line rental works out at about £29 every two months? It is an exorbitant charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. The reality is that one needs an ISDN to use a computer adequately. Such prices put the service out of reach of the ordinary person. I must declare an interest here in that the State paid for the installation of the line for all of us, but such expense is making domestic use of the Internet or computers prohibitive for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1341" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett will be aware that the price of installation has fallen substantially, but it obviously needs to fall further. I do not recall the price of it two or three years ago, but it was far more exorbitant than that &ndash; a colleague informs me that it cost a few thousand pounds at that stage.</P>
      <P>If we are to get people using the system fully and to extend it to all parts of society, which is what we must do, then cost is a factor. Driving down the costs through competition is a way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>Connectivity will help dramatically to bring Internet access to all parts because, regardless of location, a person will be able to gain access to the service. That will make a substantial difference. About £100 million is being spent in that regard. There are a number of schemes which were recently designed by some of the commercial companies purely for rural tourism, agriculture and other areas, and there has been an enormous take up of these schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The approved staffing levels in the Office of the Attorney General are set out in the following table which will be circulated in the Official Report. The vacancies are to be filled by means of open competition through the Civil Service Commission. The arrangements for a senior draftsman recruitment competition are being made at the moment.</P>
      <P>The vacancies in the administration category are at clerical level. Assignments have already been received for four of these vacancies. In addition, the office uses contract people for a number of specialist positions, including library, drafting and indexing.</P>
      <P>The office is in discussion with the Department of Finance and expects to increase its numbers. I am aware that there are difficulties in accessing the Irish Statute Book on the website of the Office of the Attorney General and I understand that the problem is currently being addressed by the office.</P>
      <P>The existing service on the website provides the Acts of the Oireachtas from 1922 to 1997 only, and is an interim solution which was put in place at the beginning of 1999. The Office of the Attorney General is making arrangements to have the Statute Book from 1922 to 1998, comprising Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables, available on the website.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the existing difficulties is that the service uses the same software as the version of the Irish Statute Book which was published on CD-ROM at the end of 1998. The software used to publish the Irish Statute Book had been optimised for use on CD-ROM. Another difficulty is that the current service is hosted in South Africa, as the company which originally carried out the project is based there.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the issues involved and a subsequent tendering exercise, the office recently selected a company to carry out required enhancements and updates to the website facility. This will comprise making the latest electronic version of the Irish Statute Book available on the World Wide Web, that is, Acts of the Oireachtas, statutory instruments and the chronological tables to the statutes from 1922 to 1998, and improving the design and search capabilities of the service. In addition, the service will be implemented in a format more suitable for use on the Internet and will be hosted in Ireland. The approximate duration of the project will be four months.</P>

      <Quest>the reason platelets are currently tested under the old serological process for hepatitis C; the further reason a PCR test is not used; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the serological test does not detect hepatitis C in someone infected 14 weeks before donation; and if, as a consequence of the failure to conduct such testing, patients are being placed at risk.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14199/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since November 1999, all blood donations collected by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service are screened by PCR for hepatitis C. PCR testing is a further safeguard aimed at improving the detection of hepatitis C during the window period. The typical length of the window period without PCR testing is ten to 14 weeks. Following the introduction of PCR testing, this window period is reduced to, on average, 25 days. In order to introduce this test as rapidly as possible, the IBTS contracted with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, SNBTS, in Edinburgh to conduct the test on its behalf. The SNBTS was selected as it has an aggressive programme for the introduction of PCR testing for all donations. The transfusion service in Northern Ireland has also contracted with the SNBTS for PCR.</P>
      <P>The use of PCR results as a release criteria for blood components by the IBTS is being introduced in parallel with the SNBTS. At present, the majority of PCR test results are returned to the IBTS on the fourth day after the donation has been taken. The test format being used in Scotland requires two to three working days in the laboratory after donation. A small number of samples require further analysis because of difficulties associated with this test. The test results are currently faxed to the IBTS. Electronic exchange of data when the IBTS's new computer system is implemented in the summer will improve turnaround time in the transmission of results. In the case of platelets, which have a shelf life of five days, improvement in assay and turnaround times will be required before PCR test results can be used to determine release of these products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 160,000 donations are tested annually by the IBTS. Donations found positive in serological tests are discarded and not issued. No such reactive result by PCR has been observed to date. In the unlikely event that a PCR positive result is observed, for example, a window period donation, appropriate follow up, including product recall, will be initiated. The risk <Col N="1347" /> of transmission of hepatitis C in the window period is currently estimated as one in 500,000 as current mandatory tests are extremely robust and sensitive. The Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, is satisfied with the current position regarding the implementation of PCR testing by the IBTS. It is not a mandatory test for blood components in Europe or in the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Blood components transfused in Irish hospitals meet all European standards. Over and above these standards, the IBTS plans to enable all components, including platelets, to be tested for PCR as a release criteria before the end of this year. This will coincide with similar arrangements in Scotland and in Northern Ireland and will be an advance on the majority of other European transfusion centres. The IBTS plans to perform PCR testing at its new headquarters within the next 12 months when a testing system is validated and fully operational.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree platelets account for up to one in three transfusions? Does he also agree the present serological testing does not detect hepatitis C in a person infected 14 weeks before donation, and I refer specifically to platelets? </P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that, in the absence of PCR testing being used for platelets, there is a genuine and serious risk of hepatitis C infection? Does he also accept it is a clear that to provide a safe product, the current arrangements with Scotland are grossly inadequate in regard to the use of platelets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The current arrangements are the best available. It is worth pointing out that within the European Union, Holland, Germany and Austria are the only EU countries which have, to date, successfully introduced PCR testing. It is the intention of the IBTS to enable all components, including platelets, to be tested for PCR as a release criteria before the end of this year. That is the target it has set. As I said, there is a risk of one in 500,000 in terms of the window period and the aim and objective of the IBTS is to have, by the end of the year, all components tested for PCR and to have the most up to date and state of the art facilities, including PCR testing capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products requires that all manufactured blood products for use in the European Union be derived from plasma pools tested negative for hepatitis C by a validated PCR test. Does the Minister acknowledge that we do not comply with that at present? Does he agree failure to address this issue with the necessary speed creates a genuine risk that some patients may contract hepatitis C? Does he acknowledge that the language he used in his reply, that is, that we <Col N="1348" /> are doing the best we can at present, is a mirror image of the type of approach adopted previously which resulted in hundreds of men and women &ndash; primarily women, but men in certain circumstances &ndash; contracting hepatitis C from contaminated blood products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's comments about the language I used. Obviously, we are taking this issue very seriously as is the IBTS. More importantly, the Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, has expressed satisfaction with the current position. The IBTS is anxious to make sure it has the wherewithal to ensure all components, including platelets, will be tested for PCR as a release criteria before the end of the year. In fairness, one has to look at what has been happening on an international scale. We, and the IBTS, in particular, are working to have the state of the art facilities here to remove all risk.</P>

      <Quest>the numbers on hospital waiting lists at the latest date for which figures are available; the steps being taken to reduce the numbers on the lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The number on in-patient hospital waiting lists as at 31 March 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, is 34,370. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 or 6.75% on the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu-like illnesses and is a reflection of the priority being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I announced yesterday a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding <Col N="1349" /> will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures, including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer-term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short, medium and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he accept that after three years in office, the Government has singularly failed to make any real impact on the waiting lists? Does he agree the Government has not even succeeded in bringing waiting lists down to the level at which they were when he and his Government took office? Does he also accept that the numbers waiting in practically all the major Dublin hospitals are higher than they were 12 months ago? Is this not a matter of concern to him? How does he intend to deal with this problem in the major &ndash;  most of the tertiary &ndash; hospitals in Dublin?</P>
      <P>How will the Minister restructure health provision to ensure those who have the greatest need to access procedures and operations, as opposed to those who have the ability to pay, access them as that is part of a commitment under the health strategy and by the ERHA? The Minister has not outlined this in any statement he has made.</P>
      <P>In regard to staffing, the Minister has not mentioned consultants. I am sure he is aware that in the past year fewer consultant posts have been filled compared to the previous two years. How does he intend to increase staffing levels to provide for this extra work to which he is committed under the latest announcement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's verdict on the Government's performance in relation to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fact; it is how one presents the facts and the position. It is not surprising that the Deputy, given her political perspective, offered the view she has. I would offer a counter view. There has been a significant increase in activity in the health services since this Government came to office. There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers attending on <Col N="1350" /> both an in-patient and out patient basis and in day cases. The numbers attending on a day case basis is up 10% this year. The level of activity has increased dramatically and more people are being treated in our hospitals this year than in the previous two years.</P>
      <P>One must look at the waiting list issue in the context of the overall volume of activity in the health services. We have invested significantly in the waiting list initiative and have made inroads in a number of areas and will continue to do so, particularly on the cardiac front. Making significant inroads on the cardiac front will require additional capacity in terms of theatre capacity, investment and availability of beds and so on. That is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In terms of those most in need, there are two categories. There are those who cannot afford private health care. That is the basis of yesterday's initiative, on top of the £22 million we made available at the beginning of the year. The purpose is to increase the number of procedures that will be carried out at the end of the year and to give people in that situation the opportunity to access them. The clinicians have a key role in identifying and prioritising those who are most in need from a clinical perspective.</P>
      <P>The proposals before us yesterday arose from consultations we have had with the health boards' chief executive officers, beginning almost eight weeks ago. We asked them to make proposals on what additional procedures they could undertake, taking on board human resource constraints, strengths and weaknesses in terms of physical capacity, and so on. The plans they produced, which we have endorsed and funded, have taken on board issues pertaining to consultants, staff availability, nursing availability, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that he is losing the battle, especially in terms of waiting times, an issue raised by him and his predecessor? Some 72% of cardiac patients are waiting more than 12 months for treatment. In terms of waiting times the problem is getting worse. Will he confirm that some patients are waiting seven years for treatment? It is an issue that has been raised in the newspapers and the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the issue raised yesterday, my office contacted the Western Health Board for clarification. It said it was unaware of any person in its area waiting seven years for an operation in neurology. It went on to say it was engaged in a major exercise in terms of computerisation of the information and that it required the co-operation of all consultants to make their lists and information available to it. Regrettably, in a number of instances that has not happened. I call on all involved in compiling statistics to play a constructive role and to work together in terms of compiling and validating them.</P>

      <Quest>if the inquiry into organ removal, retention, storage and disposal has yet commenced; if arrangements for the inquiry and the terms of reference of the inquiry are agreed with the Parents for Justice group; and if the outstanding issues of concern to the group have been resolved.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14421/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not long after coming into office, I announced my intention to hold an inquiry into post-mortem examination, policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970. The inquiry will be conducted in two phases and I have confirmed that I have appointed Ms Anne Dunne, Senior Counsel, to head up the first phase.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference stipulate that the inquiry will make its final report, including its findings to the Minister for Health and Children, within six months unless otherwise determined by the Minister. It will make recommendations to the Minister on any changes it considers necessary on foot of its findings. On receipt of this report I will then table a motion that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee, on considering the report, will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public hearing and calling witnesses as appropriate.</P>
      <P>While the terms of reference for the inquiry were drawn up after consultation with a number of parties, including Parents for Justice, the arrangements for the inquiry are a matter solely for Ms Dunne. I understand she is currently putting in place the resources, including support staff, which she deems necessary to conduct the inquiry, and expects it to commence in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Parents for Justice have expressed concerns relating to three issues. The first refers to the scope of the inquiry with particular reference to circumstances surrounding post-mortems which relate or should relate to the coroner. I have clarified that the terms of reference refers to all post-mortem examinations carried out in the State since 1970 and, as such, this will encompass those post-mortem examinations carried out in the circumstances of concern to Parents for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second concern relates to the fact that the terms of reference do not specifically require the inquiry to publicly name persons who the inquiry might regard as culpable in any way for any wrong doing which may have occurred. The legal advice available to me is that the terms of reference should not contain a specific reference in this regard and in any event such a reference would not be in accordance with the principles of natural justice. However, the absence of such a term of reference does not preclude the inquiry specifying in its report whatever detail it deems necessary. The terms of reference were amended following consultations with Parents for Justice by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;findings&rdquo;  in the <Col N="1352" /> fifth paragraph to ensure that the inquiry would provide a comprehensive report which would not merely confine itself to conclusions, opinions or recommendations. In addition, I recently arranged for the legal representatives of Parents for Justice to meet the Attorney General and this issue is currently subject to discussion between these parties.</P>
    <P>The third concern of Parents for Justice relates to the absence of a guarantee that in the event that the health agencies or health personnel concerned fail to co-operate with the inquiry, a statutory inquiry would be established. As Minister for Health and Children I expect that all hospitals and their personnel will fully co-operate with this inquiry and my Department has received confirmation in this regard. I would consider it most inappropriate if such co-operation is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>I also emphasise that the second stage of the inquiry, the referral of the report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for consideration, has a statutory basis and the committee has powers of compellability and discoverability and may hold a public hearing and call witnesses as it deems appropriate. The Deputy will appreciate that I want the inquiry to be carried out in an non-adversarial fashion and I want to ensure that it establishes the facts to the satisfaction of all concerned while at the same time preserving the independence and integrity of the inquiry. I hope the inquiry will also help to relieve the hurt and distress which has been caused to thousands of parents and relatives and that the outcome will ensure that no such hurt will ever occur again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that Parents for Justice is not happy with the terms of reference? Will he confirm if the group still requires confirmation that if the inquiry to be conducted by Ms Anne Dunne determines that people behaved wrongly or inappropriately, they be named? Will he also confirm that at present this issue is not resolved and that the inquiry has not yet commenced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is not yet resolved but, following a large meeting of members of Parents for Justice which I attended, they and I agreed that their legal advisers would meet the Attorney General to tease out the issue. I am convinced, and I have made it clear, that the terms of reference will facilitate the chairperson in arriving at findings and, if she so decides, in naming people. That is the prerogative of the chair. Since then there has been consultation between the legal advisers of Parents for Justice and the Attorney General and we expect the matter to be concluded within the next week or two. I do not wish to go any further than that at this stage because the consultations are ongoing. In the meantime, the chairperson is preparing the groundwork and <Col N="1353" /> the arrangements that are necessary for the establishment of any inquiry of this type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that if Parents for Justice is concerned about this issue a simple further amendment to the terms of reference would resolve the matter and would not require ongoing discussions with the Minister, his Department or the Office of the Attorney General? Will he inform the House of the resources being made available to the person who has been appointed to conduct the inquiry to ensure that the work that is required can be speedily undertaken? How many persons are to be employed or seconded to the inquiry as part of the team around the person who is to conduct it? Will any of them have been previously attached to a health board or hospital or the Department? When will the inquiry commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements are a matter for the chairperson and any resources the chairperson requires will be provided. The inquiry will be independent of the Department and the health boards. In that context, the chairperson and any assistant junior counsel required must have no connections with hospitals or health board agencies. If the chairperson requires further legal expertise on these issues the resources will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that all we have at present are the terms of reference about which there is still disagreement? The chairperson appointed has no staff appointed to her and has no premises from which to conduct the inquiry. No date has been fixed for when the inquiry will commence. What does the Minister propose to do to get the inquiry finally under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been at pains not to pursue a unilateral course on this issue, to seek consensus from all parties involved and to ensure that once the inquiry starts everybody is on board and co-operating with it. When we announced the terms of reference arising out of a Cabinet meeting, they were wholeheartedly welcomed by Parents for Justice on the national airwaves. Subject to that difficulties arose and I again met the groups concerned to try to resolve them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that this case came before the High Court <Col N="1354" /> recently and the judgment was issued yesterday. The position is that the High Court agreed that the child could remain in the care of the relevant health board and could be held in a psychiatric unit as an interim measure. The State proposed that a special unit be provided and the court made an order to this effect. The Department will ensure that all necessary funding will be made available for this purpose. A house is currently being adapted for use by the girl in question and work on this will be expedited. I am confident it will be ready before the 23 August deadline set by the court. Pending completion of this work, in the interests of the girl's safety and security, she will be kept in a psychiatric unit and I understand that some internal reorganisation of the unit will be undertaken to ensure that conditions, while still unsatisfactory, can be made more acceptable. The underlying reason for the necessity to respond to the needs of this girl in the manner which I have outlined is the unavailability of a suitable unit in which to place her.</P>
      <P>The requirement for such units was identified in 1995 in the FN case. However, the necessary building programme was not commenced at the time. By the end of 1996 there were only 17 places which could accommodate children with serious behavioural problems. Today there are more than 60 such places and this is primarily as a result of initiatives taken by the current Government.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2000, a further 39 such places will be available with another 56 due to open in 2001-02, bringing the total by early 2002 to 157. I share the concerns of the High Court and the other parties to the proceedings, that any child in need of special care and protection should have to be detained in an unsuitable environment but, in this case, it was the only option available. I am committed to ensuring the availability of suitable places for the cases of such children and the Government will provide the necessary funding to achieve this.</P>

Could she tell us what kind of service will be provided for this seriously behaviourally disturbed child in a house? Does she accept that the succession of placements and <i> ad hoc</i> arrangements over many years have seriously compounded her behavioural problems and her distrust of those charged with her care?

      <P>Immediately on coming into power this Government allocated £25 million in capital projects to provide 110 extra places. Unfortunately, the provision of those places takes time. The planning and building of those places is only now coming on stream. Had they been made available between 1995 and 1997, we would not have found ourselves in the situation where this child and other children like her are looking for special care. The house which has been provided for this young girl and two others in similar situations will be a secure environment because, as was said in the case, people have not ever come across a case like it. She needs a place for her own security and welfare. She will be provided with all of the psychiatric and psychological care and therapy identified for her. It is envisaged that at the end of this year and into next year, when all of the places come on stream and the full revenue and capital funding which is being provided by this Government is made available, all of the care arrangements can be put in place in a proper environment for these children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease &ndash; CJD &ndash; is one of the prion diseases which occurs in humans and certain other animal species. There are a number of categories of CJD, including variant CJD &ndash; VCJD &ndash; which is linked to the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy &ndash; BSE &ndash; agent in cattle. Worldwide, there are documented cases of CJD being transmitted accidentally to patients <i>via</i> contaminated medical instruments or contaminated pituitary hormones prepared from human cadavers. These are known as iatrogenic infections. No cases of iatrogenic CJD infection has been notified to the Department of Health and Children in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The emergence of VCJD has led to considerable scientific research into the nature of transmission of this condition. The nature of VCJD means that it is possible for transmission through hospital instruments or appliances although no case of transmission by this means has been identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CJD advisory group was established in September 1996 to advise the Minister for Health and Children on all issues relating to CJD and to provide advice on particular issues referred by the Minister to the group from time to time. <Col N="1357" /> Included in the terms of reference of the advisory group is the surveillance of CJD in Ireland, the assessment of scientific developments, both nationally and internationally with regard to the risks to public health concerning Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy agents &ndash; TSEs &ndash; and CJD and the provision of advice on research strategies for BSE-CJD.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The chairman of the group is Professor William Hall, virologist, virus reference laboratory, University College, Dublin, and the group currently consists of experts in, <i>inter alia</i>, public health, neuro-pathology, haematology, food safety and veterinary science.</P>
    <P>At meetings in 1998 and 1999 the advisory group considered the recently published UK guidance, Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents: Safe Working and the Prevention of Infection &ndash; prepared by the joint working group of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens &ndash; ACDP &ndash; and the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee &ndash; SEAC &ndash; on safe working and the prevention of infection relating to TSEs. The guidance deals with the risks from exposure to TSE agents that may arise as a result of work activities and it provides advice and recommendations on the minimisation of such risks and other related matters. It also addresses concerns about hospital infection control procedures and safe working in clinical settings.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the advisory group a copy of the guidance was circulated to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the chief executive officers of the voluntary hospitals from the Chief Medical Officer of my Department last year. The CJD advisory group continues to keep abreast of scientific developments in this area.</P>

Has the Minister or any other Minister in the Department of Health and Children met any consultants to discuss this issue and are there are any proposals emanating from his Department to put into place equipment of the nature now being installed in the United Kingdom to address this issue? Why is this issue not being treated with any sense of urgency in the context of risks that it may pose currently and in the future to patients?</P>

      <P>It is being treated very seriously and the chairman of the group is Professor William Hall, virologist, virus reference laboratory, University College, Dublin, and that group currently consists of experts in, <i>inter alia</i> public health, neuro-pathology, haematology, food safety and veterinary science. They have looked at the situation as it pertains in the United <Col N="1358" /> Kingdom and at a meeting in 1998 and again in 1999, the advisory group considered the recently published UK guidelines, Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents: Safe Working and the Prevention of Infection, as prepared by the joint working group of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens &ndash; ACDP &ndash; and the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee &ndash; SEAC &ndash; on safe working and the prevention of infection relating to TSEs. The guidance deals with the risks from exposure to TSE agents that may arise as a result of work activities and it provides advice and recommendations on the minimisation of such risks and other related matters. It also addresses concerns about hospital infection control procedures and safe working in clinical settings. The ideal situation would be to have all disposable equipment. As the Deputy knows, there were some problems before with endoscopic procedures even in this country. There is not any problem with sigmoidoscope, rectoscopes and instruments like that. I do not see a major problem in the future with having disposable equipment as a preventative measure in preventing transmission of CJD.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 98 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The consultant paediatric surgeon application referred to by the Deputies is a restructuring of an existing post which is currently shared by the three Dublin paediatric hospitals, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. The application envisaged a new structure for the position to be shared between two of these hospitals, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is a statutory body established under the Health Act, 1970, and one of its main functions is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointments. In December 1998 Comhairle published its report on paediatric surgery services. The report recommended that specialist paediatric surgery for children throughout the State be concentrated in one unit in Dublin with all three children's hospitals providing non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology. Comhairle is satisfied that the report and its recommendations represented the best way forward for the organisation and delivery of high quality and safe paediatric surgical care for children in the State given the presence of three paediatric institutions in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Comhairle has indicated to the Department that it welcomes this joint application for the post as evidence of co-operation between two of the hospitals involved. It considers, however, that the structure of the proposed post is contrary to that envisaged in its report. It does not indicate that specialist paediatric surgery will be concentrated in one unit. It leaves one hospital short of sessions, it does not address the restructuring of existing posts and has adverse implications for the structuring of other posts as set out in its report.</P>
      <P>A Council for Children's Hospital Care has been established and includes representation from the three Dublin paediatric hospitals. The council's primary role is to assist the paediatric hospitals to work with each other and the ERHA to plan and develop acute paediatric services on a co-ordinated basis in the functional area of the authority. One of the priority items identified for the council's work programme is the organisation of paediatric surgery in Dublin. The Department has already indicated its support for the restructuring of paediatric surgical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chair of the Council for Children's Hospital Care and the regional chief executive of the ERHA met last week with senior officials of <Col N="1361" /> the Department to review progress on the council's work programme and to identify a number of priorities, including paediatric surgery, which the ERHA and the council will address this year. The Department and the authority support the council's view that the area of specialist paediatric surgery merits immediate attention and that Comhairle na nOspidéal also has an important role to play in this regard. It was agreed that a further meeting should be arranged between all the parties, Comhairle, the Council for Children's Hospital Care, the ERHA and the Department, to clarify the respective roles and expectations and to agree a defined timeframe for resolving the outstanding issues regarding consultant appointments in paediatric surgery in the best interest of patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that either he or his predecessor approved or agreed to the making available of funding for this appointment? Does he agree that at a time when there is a substantial backlog in relation to children's in-patient hospital waiting lists it is unacceptable that a post should remain vacant for four years? Will he explain why he provided the financial sanction for a post to which Comhairle na nOspidéal is refusing to sanction the making of an appointment? It is not prepared to agree that the appointment should apply to the two hospitals jointly as opposed to being aimed specifically at one hospital.</P>

      <P>We are aware of that. The Department, council and Comhairle are working together. The bottom line is that we must achieve consensus. What this illustrates is that not all parties are working together on the issue and have not been for a number of years. It is not acceptable in this day and age that there is unnecessary rivalry between hospitals as to who gets what. That is at the core of the issue. My main concern are the children who require the requisite surgery at the various locations. I respectfully suggest to all concerned that it should not be beyond their capacity to agree a structure which provides a sufficient degree of complementarity of services and the best service for the children of the region. That is what I am anxious to achieve. I have asked the various agencies to work towards that end.</P>

I represent an area in which a new health board has been established and in which there is no paediatrician. Does the <Col N="1362" /> Minister accept this is an extraordinary deficiency? Efforts have been made by parents in my locality to provide for an <i>ad hoc </i>or temporary arrangement for a paediatrician at St. Columcille's Hospital. This gives a sense of urgency to the filling of the post. Does the Minister accept the waiting list in Temple Street Children's Hospital is growing and that there has been only a marginal decrease in Crumlin? Will he respond to the case that children cannot afford to wait&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's frustration. It is extraordinary that there is no paediatric service in County Wicklow. I have discussed the matter with the chief executive of the ERHA who is very keen that something be done urgently about it. That is one of the reasons and the rationale behind the establishment of the ERHA which aims to develop a regional strategic approach to services as opposed to allowing individual centres to grow in accordance with whatever turf wars are being engaged in. The ERHA will ensure a degree of co-ordination of services and a greater spread over time. Comhairle was established to regulate the appointment of consultants. We need to make up our minds on whether we agree with the devolution of statutory authority in respect of a number of issues to various bodies. While people have spoken about their desire for regional health authorities, they do not want to accept that authority and responsibility should lie in the regions in respect of the development of services.</P>

Would he also confirm that he or his predecessor sanctioned funding for this appointment? Would he further agree that the failure to make this appointment and the ongoing difficulties in this area have contributed to large numbers of children waiting far too long for surgical and medical care to which they are entitled?

      <P>However, I respect An Comhairle's statutory authority to regulate posts. The issue is not one of funding but of strategy and identifying the best strategic approach to paediatric surgery in the region over the next decade. That is the function which the Oireachtas collectively gave to An Comhairle. The Deputy may wish to address that fundamental issue in his questions, and he can endeavour to bring everything back to the Minister if he wishes. However, this House established a body with responsibility to do certain things. I have held discussions with An Comhairle and it has given me significant feedback on the appointment of consultants and so on. We are working together to ensure that we have a faster lead-in time and a faster process for the appointment and filling of consultant posts as they become available.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about a number of issues which arise from the increasing cost of settlements in cases where infants have suffered serious brain injury at or around the time of birth. In the first instance, I am concerned at the rate of increase in the quantum of damages awarded in cases where negligence is established or where settlements are made before cases go to court. I am also aware of cases where it has not been possible to establish that any negligence occurred but, nonetheless, parents are faced with the challenge of caring for severely injured babies. The needs of the children are similar in all these cases and it seems unfair that the provision of the fin<Col N="1364" /> ancial resources to care for them should be dependent on proving negligence on the part of a hospital or its medical and nursing staff. I am also aware of the fact that in these very lengthy and complex cases the legal costs associated with the claims sometimes exceed the damages awarded.</P>
      <P>A further concern is that this small group of cases distort the overall cost of providing medical indemnity cover for doctors. Despite the fact that it can cost up to £70,000 a year to provide medical indemnity cover for one obstetrician, doctors in other specialities are paying higher subscriptions in order to keep the obstetric rate at its current level. This situation is hardly sustainable in the long term. I also have a concern that the high cost of obstetric medical negligence claims may make it unattractive to young doctors who may otherwise have been considering a career in that discipline.</P>
      <P>For these and other reasons, my Department has been exploring the possibility of introducing a needs based or no fault compensation scheme for such cases. Similar schemes elsewhere have been examined and initial discussions have been held with interested parties here. However, the introduction of such a scheme raises a number of constitutional, legal and financial issues which need further study. The Government has asked that specific consideration be given to the implications of introducing such a scheme in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is similar to previous responses from his predecessor. Surely he would accept it is time the Department issued an interim statement on progress on this issue? There is nothing new in his response. This matter is raised every time there is a high profile case, as recently occured involving a settlement of £2 million. Will the Minister consider issuing some kind of progress report other than the same reply which has been given before? Would he accept that if he does not appear to make some progress on this issue, young doctors will be turned off becoming involved in obstetrics?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered a no fault compensation scheme beyond the area of obstetrics which would apply generally to issues which currently give rise to medical negligence claims? Has he considered the benefits of such an approach? What comparative study has been undertaken concerning similar schemes in other countries? Has the Government asked the Law Reform Commission to consider this issue? Would he consider such an approach if no conclusion of any nature has been reached on any of this by the Department?</P>

      <P>I have not examined the Deputy's suggestion of the wider application of a no fault scheme in terms of general medical indemnity. We are concentrating on obstetrics in terms of such a scheme, including cases of cerebral palsy and so on. If we can make progress on this issue in the first instance, then we could consider the other issues identified by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A memorandum was brought to Government on this issue last December and it has been the subject of discussions between the Attorney General's office, the Department of Finance and other agencies.

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a matter for its board of management. In April 2000 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children published its report on single site testing of blood products. The Joint Committee considered that the import of the presentations made to it might be that the security, back-up and synergy provided through enhancing the current two site testing arrangements seem significantly superior to relying on a new and, as yet, unproven centre for all the country's blood testing facilities. The report also refers to the need to ensure optimal patient care in accordance with international practice and to optimise resources to the maximum possible degree. It also refers to the risk of contamination of centralised <Col N="1366" /> laboratories and of closure due to industrial problems.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board's preliminary consideration of the report took place at its meeting on 10 May 2000 and detailed consideration of the report is now taking place. I expect to meet the board as soon as it completes its consideration of the report. I also understand that the Joint Committee is meeting with representatives of the board tomorrow concerning the report.</P>
      <P>The committee's report also refers to contention between two of the IBTS centres. I have also been informed by the board that its objective is to develop a national cohesive organisation which meets the needs of the hospital services effectively and efficiently. This objective is based on the need to address weaknesses identified in a number of reports including the report of the expert group on the BTSB, the Bain report and the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB &ndash; the Finlay report. Staff of the IBTS are located at three centres at present, namely, Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Additional staff will be located at two new mobile blood collection centres which are being established in Carlow and Ardee, County Louth. The board recently reviewed progress to date in achieving this key objective and considers that further action is now required given the establishment of two additional mobile centres.</P>
      <P>The board fully recognises the importance of the participation of staff in the ongoing development of the organisation and in improving services to hospitals throughout the country. The board is also developing a revised committee/team structure which will ensure appropriate and ongoing involvement of staff in the planning and implementation of board policy. The board will review the implementation of this initiative on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I remain concerned about the ongoing tension within the IBTS. I have raised this matter with the board and there is a strong obligation on all concerned to resolve outstanding issues that have given rise to this tension.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the report of the Oireachtas joint committee was unanimously adopted across party lines by all members of the committee? Will the Minister acknowledge that the controversy concerning the testing of blood products in Cork and Dublin has been going on for too long? Will he, in his meetings with the board, request and encourage it to agree to maintain testing in two centres and to provide for PCR testing in both centres to ensure that the public and patients will have the service to which they are entitled from the blood transfusion board and to bring to an end the ongoing disputes surrounding this issue that involve board personnel and medical professionals of eminence in the Munster region?</P>

      <P>Given that I am from Cork, it is important that I approach this matter with the <Col N="1367" /> greatest possible degree of objectivity. We must endeavour to approach this issue with a view to achieving consensus and bringing everybody on board. The Deputy is correct in identifying the unacceptable and unsatisfactory history of this issue and the tensions that have arisen as a result.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of consultations with the board and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children took time in coming to its conclusions. I and the IBTS are examining its report and I look forward to meeting the board to discuss its contents. The key issues are safety and security for the future, the implications for blood supply throughout the country and donations and the development of a cohesive IBTS.</P>

Does the Minister agree it is unfortunate that the board put pen to paper within a matter of days of the publication of the committee's report demanding that it or aspects of it be withdrawn?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Any report of an Oireachtas Joint Committee must be treated seriously and with respect because it contains the views of different parties and people with different perspectives. The IBTS raised a number of issues about which it is not happy in terms of the report. It is within its rights to seek to have those issues discussed with the committee. I hope the committee's recommendations will be teased out and further clarified by the board with the committee. The exchanges will ultimately bear fruit.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, people on both sides appear to have taken entrenched positions and this has given rise to difficulties in resolving it. There is a need to consider conflict resolution and a means of facilitating a resolution because, ultimately, whatever structures emerge, people must work together in the overall organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have arranged for the circulation in the Official Report of a tabular statement containing information provided by the health boards on the percentage uptake of MMR vaccination, broken down, where possible, on a county by county basis and, in the Dublin region, by community care area. In some health board areas the community care areas cover more than one county and in these cases it is not possible to produce a separate uptake figure for each county.</P>
      <P>My Department recently wrote to the health boards, stressing the importance of achieving high immunisation rates to prevent the further transmission of measles infection. I take this opportunity to strongly urge parents in all areas to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella.</P>
      <P>In relation to concerns which some parents may have about the MMR vaccine, the available evidence about this vaccine has been examined and the advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has been sought by my Department. All the expert advice available to me is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and either chronic inflammatory bowel disease or autism. This is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue.</P>
      <P>Recent media reports on this issue relate to an alleged association between measles and autism. However, the research concerned has not been published and so independent experts, in Ireland and elsewhere, have been unable to examine the evidence for the statements which have reportedly been made.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept it is scandalous that there was a recent epidemic of measles in Ireland which is a highly developed wealthy country? A child has already died as a consequence of measles, which is totally unacceptable. It is the Minister's responsibility to do something effective now to ensure that the rate of take up of the MMR vaccine is at a correct level. Obviously, it is not at that level at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be conscious that the system is not working at public health nurse or GP level. An insufficient number of babies are being protected against a disease which is potentially fatal. It can cause damage to children for the rest of their lives.

There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that there is a certain degree of complacency because we managed to wipe out many of these diseases and people do not remember the bad days in relation to measles and rubella.

      <P>We have already started a number of campaigns in relation to the uptake of the vaccine. There has been a considerable increase of momentum in the ERHA area in terms of visiting schools and targeting areas where the uptake rate is particularly low to ensure there is a catch up programme. The age at which children are immunised has also been reduced from 15 months to six months in areas where the uptake rate is particularly low in Dublin. We are working flat out on this issue to try to improve the uptake rates. However, this problem did not begin recently. It has been a trend over several years and we are most concerned about it.</P>

    <P>Mr. R. Bruton: The Minister indicated that he was not disposed towards accepting the amend<Col N="1372" /> ment. The general opinion on both sides of the House when it was discussed earlier was that a local liaison network is central to the success of this initiative. For the Minister to argue that this does not need to be spelled out in legislation and to view the representation of the community sector on the national board as fulfilling this clearly shows little understanding of how locally-based initiatives develop. It is important that the board sees itself as pump-priming initiatives of this nature and facilitating them to develop. That is what the amendment seeks to do. It seeks that the board act as facilitator for the emergence of the local liaison network. It seeks no more and no less and the consensus before the debate was adjourned was that this would be desirable. All the evidence exists that it would be desirable. The amendment does not damage anything else in the Bill and it is inexplicable that the Minister would not support it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Will the Minister reconsider this? As was said before the debate was adjourned, it is a matter of the board taking the initiative to encourage local networks. It does not tie it down to specifics. The amendment should be made to the legislation because the type of local networking envisaged would help promote coherent and consistent support for schools, pupils and parents. For example, a survey conducted in west Dublin in an area badly-hit economically found that there was an average non-attendance of children under 15 in the school system of 13%, while the average in a more well-to-do area of west Dublin was about 7%. Local liaison would play a crucial role in dealing with that type of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>It would also play a crucial role in helping to end one of the most scandalous wastes of public resources which is that the majority of school buildings, which are publicly-owned, are closed from 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the afternoon when they could be utilised by local networks as community resources and facilities. If there was a more organised and structured way of doing this, a new resource could be made available to the local community of school buildings and their related resources. Deprived communities are struggling to create community centres in their areas.</P>
      <P>This amendment would be of great assistance to educational welfare officers. It is critical that these people are brought on stream quickly and that resources are allocated so that they can assist local networks of parents, teachers and groups to come to grips with the problems of non-attendance and other issues.</P>

      <P>I accept the points made by Deputies about the importance of locating schools within a local network of other service providers, voluntary groups and other local agencies. In that sense, I agree with the points made by the Deputies. However, as they have pointed out on many occasions, mere legislative drafting <Col N="1373" /> will not create such networks and the ones which have been created and to which they have referred have come about through good management and organisation and not through legislation.</P>
      <P>These structures need to be developed over time and supported in their development. I have made explicit provision for the educational welfare board to take account of these needs and to support their development in sections 9 and 22 and in the membership of the board. However, it is imperative that the board takes continuing and ongoing notice of this critical issue. Therefore, I am happy to inform Deputies that I intend on the enactment of the legislation to write to the board to set out my views and those of the House on the importance of this issue. As Deputies will be aware, section 12 makes provision for the Minister to make such directions to the board.</P>

      <P>School attendance strategies concern the identification at an early stage of students who have problems and the establishment of closer contacts between the school and the families of students. It does not deal with the type of local networks which have been the subject of our discussion. Such networks bring together the community, the educational welfare officer, key players, such as the juvenile diversion officer and the health board social worker, and key groups which can help run homework clubs. These are the people who would be part of a local liaison network and who would, as Deputy Joe Higgins said, dramatically extend the reach of the educational welfare officer in terms of executing their task. It is not just the school with which we are concerned in the school strategy and that is why we have failed in many ways and have a record of non-attendance which is double that of the rest of Europe. We have been preoccupied with in-school policies rather than recognising that it is part of something broader within the community which we must develop. The Minister is wrong in pointing to section 21 as a solution. Section 9 deals with functions and I do not see <Col N="1374" /> any implication that the board must foster the development of local networks in this way.</P>
      <P>What we have proposed in this amendment could not be construed as putting some type of bureaucratic dead hand on the development of local initiative. It is framed in a way which facilitates the board as much as possible to do this in a flexible way. It does not define catchments within which it must be done nor does it impose an obligation to do it. It is about encouraging the board to go in this direction and facilitate this development. As other Deputies have experienced from their constituencies and as I have from mine, the reality in many communities is that the development of such networks already exists in embryonic form. What the board can do is prime the pump of those which exist in embryonic form and allow them develop more strongly. It can also roll out those successful models to areas where it does not exist. We on the north side of Dublin could learn a great deal from Clondalkin because it has been good in this area of building networks to track early school leavers. There is scope for us to learn in parts of our constituencies on the north side. The board is in a unique position to draw together the strengths of different local liaison networks to try to foster those in different areas and to reach out to the areas which have none. In too many areas there are schools where, after 3 o'clock and the talk and chalk is over, no further support exists for children. We must break out of that model and this amendment is a good opportunity.</P>
      <P>I do not have confidence in the Minister's writing to the board. If the Minister will refuse to accept an amendment which does not impose anything which could possibly be construed as hamstringing the board, I have no confidence that some letter which he will write to the board after this debate in which we will have no say and into which we will have no input could possibly meet the needs of the amendment. The Minister can write his letter to the board but he should also accept the amendment which has been tabled in good faith and which can only help endorse a movement which already exists by supporting, nurturing and expanding it. That is what we need to do rather than thinking that the Educational Welfare Board and educational welfare officers can have all the answers without these invaluable networks which exist and need to be developed elsewhere.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>12.&ndash;(1) The Minister shall appoint one of his or her officers as a development officer for each school in every disadvantaged area, in order to promote the development of appropriate relationships between the school <Col N="1377" /> and the local business community and relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>(2) An officer of the Minister appointed under this section shall not be given additional remuneration by virtue of having been so appointed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a proper liaison process is put in place and it is aimed specifically at schools in disadvantaged areas. I have no wish to repeat points which were made earlier. However, there is a fundamental difference between the Minister's arguments in respect of previous amendments and those offered by Members on this side of the House. The Minister is putting his faith in a kind of evolving sentiment which he believes will deliver everything provided for in the Bill. Members on this side, however, have argued that there is a need to put the incentive and the prescription of a statutory provision in place to ensure that this will happen.</P>
    <P>In a disadvantaged area where a number of schools are experiencing the same problems, it becomes enormously valuable to have a wise individual who can incorporate the various structures into a balanced whole. The amendment refers to the &ldquo;relationships between schools and the local business community and relevant agencies&rdquo;. In that context, when I served on the McBride Commission on the Prison System many years ago, I had the privilege to hear the evidence of a retired senior school attendance officer from Dublin. The person in question had adopted a wonderful approach in terms of the way he anticipated the problems of children. It is no reflection on the Minister, his predecessor or the current staff of the Department but, at that time, the Department of Education did not share its data with the Department of Justice. The retired chief attendance officer's view was that children at risk could have been identified much earlier if such data had been shared.</P>
    <P>I cannot discuss issues of cost and I was obliged to include subsection (2) in the amendment to ensure that it was not ruled out of order. However, I am allowed to state that there are many people who could offer great expertise in terms of suggesting how the network could be put in place. With respect, the Minister may be aware of places throughout the country in which there are excellent emergent systems where people are co-operating with each other in all forms of partnership but I am equally aware of places in which that is not happening. We should not leave these matters to chance and a statutory mention would ensure that such a network would be put in place.</P>
    <P>In reply to a previous amendment, the Minister stated that he could envisage the system evolving. We cannot afford that time because we are experiencing problems now and not only in regard to literacy, children's problems and children in trouble. I insist on using the term &ldquo;children in trouble&rdquo; because all these children can be saved. I would be interested to hear whether the <Col N="1378" /> Minister will incorporate my suggestion in his directions to or communications with the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention in providing for the appointment of educational welfare officers is that they will perform a number of functions relating to school attendance and will, in doing so, liaise with individual schools, pupils, parents and other appropriate services. Liaison with other appropriate services will be further ensured through the appointment of the liaison officers, as provided for in section 12.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Welfare Board, as the national overseeing body, will be in a position to ensure the co-ordination of all its officers' activities. For the Minister to appoint development officers would provide nothing more than an overlap of functions. The Deputy asked whether these matters would be covered in directions to the board and I would be happy to do that as I am very anxious to see the board operating effectively. I am anxious to progress this legislation in order that the board etc. can be functioning by autumn. This is a major development and we want to ensure that, in management terms, it will do the job we want it to do.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister again specify where the liaison service will be located? Will it have its source in the Department? I am trying to envisage the organisation chart or structure for the service. Will it be a local structure? It cannot be a regional service because the Government is ideologically opposed to regional structures. Will the liaison service exist in an administrative manner? Who will staff the liaison service? Who will run it and to whom will it report? We will all welcome the educational welfare officers when they arrive but what will the structure be? Will the service be completely paper-based?</P>

      <P>The officers will be local but there will be a national structure. I am considering the entire structure of the Department with a view to localising and regionalising it. We have held discussions with the unions and an independent investigation is being carried out into how this might be done. We want to ensure the Department will operate on a local and regional basis. At the moment, the Department is administered from a central point, a matter about which the Deputy is concerned. I assure the Deputy that it is our intention to localise and regionalise our structures.</P>

As far as school attendance issues and educational welfare are concerned, it would seem to <Col N="1379" /> me that it would be very important to have the network at local level.

I would not have any problem, given sufficient time, with putting the group of directions together and laying them in the Oireachtas Library or with allowing people to inspect particular directions. However, a large number of detailed directions will be issued, particularly in the early stages. We are not dealing here with regulations which will last for several years. It would always be possible at the end of a six month period to make a group of directions available in the Library. These type of internal management directions are not normally laid before the Houses.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated on Committee Stage that he would re-examine the wording of my amendment prior to Report Stage. I took that to mean that he would accept the amendment. The Library is a spacious place and it is now possible to lay reports etc., however large, before the Houses electronically. I would be happy if the directions were to be laid before the Houses in electronic form in order that we could access these directions. I am not asking the Minister to transport all of these heavy directions to the Library in a wheelbarrow but if he issues written directions to the board, they should also be made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <P>A direction will be available if it is required. However, there will be a section dealing with such directions and one would probably need to put them together in the form of a book every three or six months. I have no problem making such an arrangement in order that they are made available. I did that at one stage when I was the Minister for Social Welfare. However, there are huge numbers of these directions. While one can get individual ones, I am prepared to give an undertaking to put them together, bind them and make them available at intervals of three or six months.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the Minister makes a song and dance any time we seek to make a simple amendment. We just want information to be laid in the Library. Why is he stating he will issue the directions at intervals, or that he will write to somebody and see would they do it? This is a simple amendment. It is common in most legislation that written ministerial directions to a body are available on the public record. If Ministers make such policy directions, we are entitled to see them. Our job is to monitor policy directions made by Ministers to boards. The Minister is trying to make a meal of this. He is obliged to inform the House of actions on policy matters. He should do his job and agree to lay these directions before the Houses of the Oireachtas. He should stop this song and dance about how he will put them together, bind them, etc.</P>

      <P>The Minister claims this is part of the day to day operations. The section states the Minister may give a direction in writing to the board requiring it to comply with policy decisions made by the Minister on the functions of the board. The Minister may then amend them. These go to the heart of the policy framework within which the board will operate.</P>
      <P>Every time we seek to make an amendment the Minister responds by stating he will bear in mind what the House has to say and make directions and suggestions to the board. However, when it comes to the House seeing those directions or suggestions, the Minister claims they are too comprehensive and difficult to communicate to the Deputies, yet he can put them together and bind them and produce his binder to the Library. This is lunacy. You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, have been in the House much longer than I, but I cannot understand why ministerial directions to a board set down in legislation should be treated in a cloak and dagger fashion and why the Minister will not release them to the Oireachtas. The Minister claims these matters are complex. We can understand complex issues. These are directions regarding high level policies.</P>
      <P>One in five pupils drop out of school early and one in ten leave school without adequate literacy skills. There is a serious problem of absenteeism, the level of which is double that in the rest of Europe. In that context, the Minister is not willing as a matter of course to publish directions issued to the board responsible for trying to improve the situation and to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. If the Minister takes such an ostrich-like view of education policy issues, we are wasting our time debating these issues in the Dáil. I weep when I hear his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, talk of reforming the electoral system to make this Dáil more relevant when a Minister comes in here and states we are like mushrooms, that we should be kept in the dark and up to our knees in &ldquo;you know what&rdquo;. That is the attitude the Minister is displaying towards the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We are simply looking for what is our right, to know what policy directions are being issued by the Minister to the board, which we were a party to establishing. We want no more and no less. If the Minister cannot agree to this, it is a sorry state of affairs in the context of the relevance of this House.</P>

      <P>I may be of assistance in this regard. I see a parallel between this and when I was Minister with responsibility for broadcasting. If one had to consider an issue of policy, one drew a distinction between a policy matter and a matter which related to the administration of a semi-State body which was at arms length from the Minister. For example, the order under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act is a policy matter but how it will be implemented within RTE is a practical management matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> The text of the Bill, which Deputy Bruton's amendment addresses, states that the &ldquo;Minister may give a direction in writing to the board requiring it to comply with policy decisions made by the Minister in relation to the functions of the Board.&rdquo; It is reasonable to expect that those in the legislature who frame, approve of, oppose or amend legislation shall be involved in matters of policy.</P>
    <P>On the execution and the detail of it, without referring to the Devlin report, etc., there is a chief executive in the Department related to the execution of the Minister's policy directions. One is not requiring the provision of the combined correspondence of the Minister with the board but such policy directions as the Minister may make to the board.</P>
    <P>I could think of many other parallels. I might give an example of where it would be a matter of assistance to a Minister. For example, if the statistics on dropouts, literacy, etc., to which Deputy Bruton referred, remain the same and the Minister found it necessary to write to the board to say his policy regarding what was intended in the legislation was being frustrated, it would be of great assistance for the Minister to put such before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It could then be debated and the Minister could be assisted, and it might be necessary to replace the board.</P>
    <P>The issue is being unnecessarily confused. That which is policy can be before the House and that which is administration can remain with administration. Nobody wants the detail of the administration. People want only notice of the policy decisions.</P>

      <P>There is a difference. This is an agency of my Department, not an independent semi-State body. There will be many communications and directions regarding policy, particularly in the early stages. The main reason in this case is not to get the day to day workings involved because there will be a great deal of toing and froing. There may be a direction in a letter about doing something in a particular way and a response stating not to do it that way. The process will go on in that fashion. Therefore, after a period one would reach conclusions on the way in which things would be done and these can be put together more easily. As I have stated, I do not mind giving a summary periodically. I am just concerned because I do not want to create a great deal of bureaucracy for this body as it starts out, or for the Department.</P>

While I appreciate that Report Stage can be very confining, I remind the House that Members may speak twice. Members may make a second contribution on each amendment which may not exceed two minutes. The Member who moved the amendment retains the right of reply so that the mover of an amendment may speak three times: a contribution when moving the amendment, a second contribution of two minutes and a third contribution to conclude the debate.

      <P>Amendment No. 41 is a technical amendment which seeks to clarify the purpose and role of the register. I have had this matter re-examined by the parliamentary draftsman. The Deputy's fear was that a loophole existed in this section. The parliamentary draftsman has assured me that there is not a loophole and that the legislation is satisfactory. The register is only designed to cater for students who do not attend a recognised school. Students will be admitted to the register on application of their parents who have decided to educate, or have their child or children educated in a place other than a recognised school. This circumstance is dealt with in subsection (2). There is no other circumstance of entry to the register. It is not my view, for instance, that children educated at a school and additionally by their parents at home will need to be registered under this section.</P>
      <P>I have had this matter clarified by the draftsman and he has confirmed that the Bill is satisfactory as it stands.</P>

      <P>While I acknowledge that the draftsman is, at least, being consistent in insisting <Col N="1384" /> that he was right the first time, I worry about the advice he has given the Minister. Words are words and the language of the section is what will be invoked. Section 13(1) and (2) states:</P>
      <P>(1) The Board shall, on the commencement of this section, cause to be established and maintained a register of all children in receipt of education in a place other than a recognised school (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;the register&ldquo;).</P>
      <P>(2) Subject to <i>subsection (3)</i>, where a parent chooses to educate, or have educated, his or her child in a place other than a recognised school he or she shall, in accordance with this section, apply to the Board to have the child concerned registered in the register.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to say that subsection (2) allows a parent to choose to exercise the option of going on the register. Unfortunately, this does not relieve one from the ambiguity of the language in subsection (1), which states explicitly that the board shall &ldquo;cause to be established and maintained a register of all children in receipt of education in a place other than a recognised school&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The impact of this subsection on anyone who attends a language school or any sort of specialised class is clear. The draftsman may have facilitated parents in exercising an educational option and putting their child on a register. Unfortunately, the specificity of subsections (2) and (3) does not relieve the ambiguity of subsection (1).</P>

      <P>On further consideration, the difficulty in subsection 13(1), to which my amendment is directed, is not relieved by subsection 13(2). I now see a difficulty because subsection 13(2) does not refer to a child being principally educated. Any supplementary education chosen by a parent falls within the ambit of the register, as the Bill is worded. We are in agreement regarding the procedure involved in parents putting a child on the register. However, subsection 13(1) has the merit and demerit of a simple statement. It means that any education outside formal schooling requires to be registered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> In page 12, lines 18 and 19, to delete &ldquo;apply to the Board to have the child concerned registered in the register&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;register with the Board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section deals with home education when a parent chooses to educate his or her child at home rather than in a recognised school. The Minister is making provision for such a parent to apply to be included on a register. A vetting system will be put in place to determine if such a parent can continue to educate his or her child at home. The thrust of the legislation appears to be hostile to the notion of home education and I grant that the Minister has modified many of the more objectionable features of the Bill, as first drafted. The thrust of that is fairly hostile to the notion of home education. I grant that the Minister has modified many of the more objectionable features of this Bill, as first drafted. In this amendment I put forward the concept that instead of waiting to be vetted and considered acceptable to educate in the home, parents who educate in the home should automatically go on a register and that only if the board subsequently felt they were not reaching an acceptable standard, a process of assessment and examination would be put in place.</P>
    <P>The alternative is that the board will immediately be presented with the assessment of every family educating in the home within a short period. The other approach would mean parents register first and then the board, having developed a good advisory service to support home education and enable it to be in a position to deal with it, could then consider the parents who have registered. It could offer the support of its own expertise and proceed to carry out the various assessments for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>That would be a preferable approach and would be less threatening in its appearance to people who perhaps have many years experience in home education. The Minister will probably say the effect will be the same but there is a lot in the way one approaches this issue. Parents are the primary educators and this Bill still, even with the improvements, gives the impression that home education is something of an aberrant behaviour which has to be carefully vetted before it is accepted.</P>
    <P>The Constitution recognises that home education is possible and acceptable once a minimum standard is achieved. My amendment seeks to ensure the tone of this legislation is more in character with the Constitution and that approach. It will not, in any way, dilute the State's obligation and duty to ensure a parent educating in the home achieves a minimum standard.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's amendment. I have an interest in home education due to the fact a number of my constituents have been involved in it. Unfortunately, there was a number of high profile District Court cases in regard to some of the individuals involved. The thrust of the cases and the media attention gave <Col N="1386" /> the impression that home education was not the way forward. The legislation in place at the time could not deal with home education adequately. What Deputy Bruton said is important in that we should enact legislation which has more in common with the thrust of our Constitution than try to subvert people who decide in their wisdom that home education is the best way to educate their children. It is extremely important that this legislation deals with that and that structures should be put in place.</P>
      <P>A number of people have contacted me about home education and they have made two points. They want a designated home education adviser to be appointed to oversee and carry out the assessment of home education. That is a fair and worthwhile proposal and I hope the Minister will consider it. They also asked that when making appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board and the appeals committee, he should include a lay person with an interest in and an understanding of home education. Heretofore, the Department of Education and Science probably felt that people who educated at home should not have done so. The people involved in the constituency I represent felt isolated in their communities but they have done some excellent work with their children at home. I would be grateful if the Minister would consider the proposals I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton acknowledged the fact that we have listened carefully to what was said earlier. We talked to various interest groups and tried to balance this against the legal duties imposed on me as Minister. The Bill has changed very substantially in the light of the changes brought in during its passage through the Dáil. I also considered models from other jurisdictions and, where appropriate, incorporated changes. In those circumstances, I believe the Bill has struck a reasonable balance. I understand the rationale of the Deputy's amendments Nos. 42 and 43 but I do not consider it possible to accept them.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain my thinking in the area of registration. The State has a solemn constitutional duty to vindicate the rights of children just as much as it does in the case of the rights of adults. A core right of children is to receive an education which enables them to make the best use of their abilities and equip them for life. The system of registration and assessment provided in this section seeks to create an effective structure to vindicate this right of each child. I have tried to ensure that, in so doing, the system respects the rights of parents. On balance, therefore, I am of the view that the basic structure of this section must remain unaltered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of a child to an education is so precious, particularly in the context of today's knowledge based society and the protection afforded to this right by the Constitution is so strong, I am of the view that we, as a society, must take sufficient steps to protect these rights. This amendment would alter the focus of the relationship <Col N="1387" /> between the National Educational Welfare Board, as an institution, and each parent or parents. I am not convinced of the value of this amendment. It is essential that, in an area as important as a child's education, the board satisfies itself that the child in question is receiving a minimum education. A direct relationship between parents and the National Educational Welfare Board is the best means to ensure this.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I draw the attention of Deputies to section 13(6) which allows the board to register all children attending an institution once the board is satisfied that the institution is providing a certain minimum education. I am satisfied that this is a more appropriate means to deal with this particular situation. The objective of registration is to establish which children are not attending recognised schools so that their education can be assured in line with the State's constitutional duty.</P>
    <P>The decision to educate a child outside the recognised school system is that of the parents, not an institution which they are attending. It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the initial responsibility for registration lies with the parent. However, it is also appropriate that where the board is satisfied an institution is providing at least a minimum education to all its attending students, it is not necessary for each student to undergo a detailed assessment to establish this fact. On balance, therefore, I am happy for the section to stand as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's argument in relation to amendment No. 43. Section 13(6) adequately deals with that matter. Given that my earlier amendment was lost and the fact the Minister does not envisage developing policies within schools which are not recognised ones in regard to attendance and so on, this amendment no longer has any validity. I withdraw amendment No. 43.</P>
      <P>I am not, however, entirely persuaded by the Minister's argument in relation to amendment No. 42, although I do not propose to divide the House. The Minister rightly said that it would alter the focus of the relationship between a parent engaged in home education and the board. It would not have a penal or inspectorate type relationship and it would change it to more of an advisory one and one where inspection would be done in extreme circumstances where the parent is no longer reaching a standard. I am not sure whether changing that focus would not be a good thing. As my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, said, we would have an advisory element within the board. That would be the merit of the small change I propose in this amendment. It would change the focus on what the Minister rightly identifies, but it would not be a bad change because a greater partnership would develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not press the amendment because amendment No. 45 also deals with the idea of an advisory service or at least having advice available to <Col N="1388" /> the board that would be relevant to the needs of home educators. The Minister should see the merit in a change in focus as proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot start to regulate the home side, although I take the point about providing guidelines or advice and will consider that aspect. If an application has to be made to the board to have the child registered that gives an explicit opportunity for assessment. If, however, it is provided that the person will merely register with the board, there is no requirement for assessment. It could be argued that in a roundabout way there is an obligation on the Minister in this regard and that he can, in law, ensure that such an assessment takes place.</P>

      <P>This was requested by home school parents, among others, in communication with us.

      <P>Amendment No. 44 has been taken on board to some degree by an amendment in my name on Committee Stage providing that it should not be necessary for the parent to specify the times at which a child is receiving an education at home. Deputy Higgins has proposed to take this further and remove the requirement that parents specify the place at which a child is educated. However, it is important that the place of education be specified. Deletion of this requirement might lead to a situation where certain parents might try to evade their requirements under the Act to the detriment of the child's education. This is a reasonable requirement given the importance of the subject in question &ndash; the right of each child to receive a certain minimum education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to the point I made to the Minister on Committee Stage. We have a difficulty evaluating the home school option. It is not easily resolved but it will have to be. The <Col N="1389" /> thinking, the procedures and the way people in the Department operate are very much in terms of formal schooling. There is a difference between that and home school education. Of its nature, home school education will probably be best assessed &ndash; even if I am guided in the court decisions on this &ndash; by the outcome of the education as much as anything else. So, a child may visit an art gallery, he may be brought to a natural history museum or an interactive display or whatever.</P>
      <P>I have a problem here. The Minister acknowledged my case on Committee Stage by removing the time requirement. If he specified the principal place at which the child receives the education I probably would not have moved my amendment. The difficulty with the provision is that the home school parent would have to specify a long list which would probably include the National Library, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland and the waxworks, if one wished to be exotic, and I could go on. I cannot see how the language of the Bill cannot be construed other than that.</P>
      <P>It is provided that the application shall be in writing and shall specify the place at which the child receives the education to which the application relates. It does not refer to the principal place, which would make sense. The home address or an institution combining these different aspects could be provided. The Minister must clarify this. I do not believe he intended that the provision would result in the list I have outlined. If he had introduced an amendment providing that reference to the principal place would suffice, this amendment might not be necessary. That is why I propose the deletion of lines 27 and 28 on page 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be careful about the child and the interests of the child. In specifying the place one can specify the house or some other house. Reference can also be made to educational trips, which would be natural. I do not have a problem with that. The main difficulty is to be assured that there is a place where the principal education takes place. This then raises the question of defining the principal place of education.</P>
      <P>I do not see a problem arising here. Where somebody is concerned about it, when detailing the place they can always specify visits from that place, including, for example, field trips. The provision at least ensures that a location will be provided where people can find where the child is being educated.</P>
      <P>It would be easy for the Department to say it has hundreds of thousands of pupils to look after and it does not want to be worried by somebody who wants to bring up their child and educate them. However, there is an onus on the Department to at least ensure that the child receives a minimum education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has changed enormously in recent years in terms of the kinds of programmes of education it covers. The changes have been <Col N="1390" /> very successful, although there is more scope for change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be for me to make the Minister's optimism wither by a fraction, but I am glad he finds progress everywhere and that he acknowledges much scope for it. I will not be provoked into thinking where it was required. I wish everybody was involved in all these changes.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman who is advising him is providing him with very loose language. I will not go into a jurist construction of it but what, for example, if the person specified a place and then responded that the child was at another. I am as moved as the Minister by the child's protection in this. We must at all stages know that the child is receiving an education. I accept that but it is my function on Report Stage to point out that the Minister's draftsperson should have provided him with better language.</P>
      <P>When one applies for a passport, one has an interaction with any one of the agencies of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the usual term used is principal place of residence. There is a formulation there right across the statutes that could be found. There seems to me to be a very general, generic reference to a place in which the child receives an education. I do not see a way out of it anyway because if one offers home education, one cannot then, coming out of the schooling ethos, say that most of it will be at 4 Tobercurry Avenue or whatever address one wants to register, when one will be out most of the time. To comply with this legislation, even if they are only before a court for five minutes, people will find themselves listing places where the child is educated. My only problem is that they do not say the language is not what it means. It eschews a reference to principal place of education; it retains place of education. I will not say more about it.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 35, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who has relevant experience in education outside recognised schools&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the system the Minister envisages for an authorised person to carry out an assessment of the education being provided, the materials used, the time spent and so on in the case of a parent who is choosing to educate their child at home. There is considerable concern that the authorised person in this case might be someone who comes from the culture of an inspector of a recognised school and would have little sympathy or experience with the case of a home educator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Amendment No. 45 seeks that the authorised person would have relevant experience in education outside recognised schools, in other words, that it would be someone with an expertise, empathy with and experience in this field. People would be considerably reassured if that were the case because there is a danger that one is setting up a false challenge for someone who has chosen to educate in the home and who is then being inspected by someone who is steeped in the culture of education within a school. That could create a source of friction that would be quite unhelpful to the operation of the legislation the Minister is putting in place. This amendment is a small one but would be valuable and helpful in the way we deal with this home education issue.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 51 refers to where the Minister is making guidelines and recommendations as he feels appropriate in determining whether a child is receiving a certain minimum education. As the Minister will have heard from those who are involved in home education, they are quite surprised that the Minister has moved away from prescribing a minimum education where a parent would know exactly the yardstick against which they would be judged. The Minister probably did that, for what reasons I do not know but I think they were partly legal reasons. The Minister has chosen a more flexible way but people feel they are being judged without knowing the yardsticks against which they are being judged. That has caused a problem.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister is, under section 15, taking the power to issue guidelines and make recommendations, it seems appropriate that he would, as provided for by amendment No. 51, consult with persons with relevant experience in education outside of recognised schools. As it now stands, he is simply making consultations with the National Council for Curriculum Assessment and such other persons unspecified in drawing up these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Again, it would be useful if people who have specific expertise in home education and who are sympathetic to and understand home education were among those who are consulted when drawing up those guidelines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In drawing up the guidelines, the National Council for Curriculum Assessment would advise me as Minister. The objective of section 13 is to ensure that children who are educated outside of the recognised school system are receiving at least a constitutional entitlement to a minimum education. Ascertaining this involves a level of skill and competence in the education of children generally. It is not necessarily the case that a person must have experience in home education to assess the education being provided. If they were to provide that, they would unnecessarily tie the hands of the national educational welfare board. There will have to be training relating to the approach to this matter and I <Col N="1392" /> accept what the Deputy says about the sensitivity of the work and the understanding of it generally.</P>
      <P>In the case of section 15, the same arguments hold. It is not necessary to have experience of home education to set down guidelines for what constitutes a minimum education for children. As I said, the NCCA will advise me on the guidelines as Minister.</P>

      <P>I have difficulty with the Minister's reply. It reminds me of the discussion we had on Committee Stage. We are back now to the tension that exists between the different concepts of schooling and education. For example, an inspector who is familiar with the training of a particular teacher for the classroom, with a curriculum for delivery in the classroom in a school building that is managed according to departmental regulation, is a person in possession of a particular kind of experience and knowledge. I know from meeting many such excellent people who performed in different ways, that they are products of a particular view of schooling within education. With the greatest respect for such people, home education is different.</P>
      <P>There is a little arrogance in the suggestion, not on the part of the Minister but on the part of the hypothetical person who would say, that to do their job, in looking, inspecting, invigilating and all the other matters, they would have to have regard to the whole person and their education. With respect, that is not good enough. That is like saying that once a person had driven one car, they had driven them all. There is a touch of that argument there. The suggestion was that if they needed to look at anything other than schooling, it could be achieved with a little training. This is not good enough. I am impressed by the argument made by those who wrote to us citing countries such as Tasmania, which we helped found by sending a good quota of criminals in our time, which has an advanced system with the same number of families involved, 200, as we have and which has a home education adviser assessing home education. It is different. Very few people have defended the public service as much as I have over 30 years but it is a bit much to say that anything to do with home education can be grafted on to what we already have. I am not impressed by that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see for the life of me why these two amendments which appear reasonable and would satisfy those who are doing something very difficult, choosing an option separate from the conventional one, cannot be accepted. What is wrong with this? Do not ask me to accept the notion that we are so well trained for what we are doing in relation to schooling that we will automatically be brilliant at this also. Frankly, they are not too brilliant at what is happening in the classroom, as is patently clear from what is being produced. While I am my party's spokesperson on education I will not stand for ten minutes and repeat the mantra that we have the most wonderful and best inspected system in the known world. There are <Col N="1393" /> a few heavy blotches. In wishing everyone well in getting on with the task let us not assume that those who are used to classroom form evaluation will be able to deal with the other automatically or prepare themselves for the task over a few weekends. They will not.</P>
    <P>The amendment is moderate. It asks that the person concerned should have relevant experience in education outside recognised schools. Surely such a person should not be hard to find. If we were to place an advertisement in the international press we might get one or two applicants. I imagine there would be many.</P>

      <P>I am not persuaded by the Minister's argument. I envisage that the board will want to establish a team to deal exclusively with home education which should not become part of a tack-on to an inspectorate or the ordinary work of an educational welfare officer. It is a particular task which will require expertise and empathy with what is happening in home education. It will therefore require persons who are not only sympathetic but also capable of advising parents and identifying weaknesses and improvements. This is very different from the traditional type of inspection about which the Minister seems to be talking. He said that it is not necessary to have experience and sympathy with home education to make this assessment. On balance, it is necessary to have relevant experience over and above a weekend or a crash course of a few days to bring a person up to speed. A different task is being taken on. The board will have to develop a core of persons who are skilled in this area, who will be able to offer advice and support and ultimately make the decisions which I hope will not be common but which on occasion will have to be made of withdrawing the right to continue to provide education in the home.</P>
      <P>The Minister is incorrect in his view. This would be the right way to go, although it would place a burden on the board in the short-term. It would not be able to say that it had an identikit person who will perform this task straight from the inspectorate. The Minister should reconsider the matter. If he wants to modify the wording that would be satisfactory but it is an important issue.</P>

      <P>While I am anxious to ensure the persons concerned have relevant experience, I do not envisage any great problems in practice in this area. I do not envisage inspectors descending from outside in great hordes. To a large extent a hands-off rather than a hands-on approach is being adopted. There will still be however an onus to ensure that a child receives a minimum education. We are talking about 200 to 300 families. There are about 953,000 students in the recognised system and there are staff shortages. There will also be an appeals system in place. While the system should provide those providing education in the home with the freedom they require, there is an onus on me to ensure a child <Col N="1394" /> receives a minimum education. I am therefore not accepting the amendments.</P>

On a ratio of 20:1 the equivalent of ten teachers would be required to service the 200 families concerned if they have only one child and choose to send them to recognised schools. This is not a part-time task that one tacks on to someone's job. The parents concerned are making a serious commitment and the support of the State cannot, as the Minister seems to have at the back of his mind, be trivialised to a tiny fraction of a person's time.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) a portfolio of the child's work,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill as drafted the Minister will have an authorised officer of the board make an assessment of the education being provided, the materials used and the time spent in the provision of such education. It seems a portfolio of the child's work should also be looked at. Most home educators would be developing such a portfolio. In many ways this is more important than the materials used and time spent in the provision of such education. One could say that this is envisaged but it would be worth making it explicit. In the longer term I hope the board in relation to its advisory role in respect of home education which I hope it will develop will work through and review the portfolio and identify ways of strengthening it. I hope the amendment commends itself to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of the Bill is interesting in what it reveals. It reveals the thinking of a school based system. Let me give an example of what I mean. Paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) read, &ldquo;the materials used, or that it is proposed will be used, in the provision of such education&rdquo; and &ldquo;the time spent, or that it is proposed will be spent, in the provision of such education&rdquo;. Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to add the words &ldquo;a portfolio of the child's work.&rdquo;  Let me give an example of how this would work. If, for example, a person goes to the national gallery and responds to a painting, or if a person goes to the zoo or the natural history museum, what is important is the end product. The portfolio will not only show the provision of materials. The Bill's drafters are trying to stipulate that, for example, a parent could provide the materials and the child could have drawn anything he or she liked but nothing happened. A parent may claim that the child had half the day to draw a picture and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Line drawing is a technique which, unfortunately, is badly neglected in the formal schooling system which sometimes does not have the <Col N="1395" /> materials, even for students taking examinations. However, if one wished to practise line drawing during a visit to the natural history museum or wherever, the important issue is how the visit worked and the quality of the relationship between the stimulus, the educator and the child being educated. It is a very dated approach to say that the materials were provided and the parents said they would call the child at 8.30 a.m. and so on. There could also be a piano in the house. There are musical instruments throughout the country that no one plays. The materials and the time spent are not the issue. The value of the portfolio is that it is able to give a view of the outcome of the process and that is why I support the amendment. It makes sense.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) <i>Subsections (4)</i> to <i>(7)</i> of <i>section 9</i> shall apply to any assessment of a registered child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to achieve parity of treatment between parents of children in the formal school system and parents in the home education system. Children in school have a particular procedure by which they can be assessed, whether by consent or by court order. As it stands, the Bill offers a different procedure for assessing children being educated in the home. It would be fairer if we had an equivalence so I am seeking that section 9(4) should apply to the assessment of any registered child. This is a reasonable proposal in that we are trying to establish equivalence and parity between different forms of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and there seems to be an anomaly. In one case, where a parent refuses to co-operate with the assessment, the board would refuse to register the parent and the child for home education. In the other case, there seems to be an obligation on the board to then apply to the Circuit Court for an order. These treatments seem dramatically different and it is not clear why the notion of applying for an order is not applied in both cases.</P>

      <P>The difference is that section 13 includes a constitutional requirement while section 9 is a more open situation in that the parent may decide. The amendment refers to earlier discussions on Report Stage where we agreed to change the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; to &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;. I was happy to make that change but I do not see that the procedures for making such assessments should change. The situations in which an assessment would be made under section 13 are different from those under section 9. Accordingly, I would prefer to leave the position as it stands.</P>

      <P>Apples are not oranges and it goes without saying that home education is different from the formal school system. This is not new information. Members on this side are as anxious for the security of the child as the Minister in his proposed legislation. However, if there is to be a difference in procedure one has to be able to justify that difference. If the Minister was to come clean and say that he has a more regimented system in the formal school system and that because he would not be able to keep an eye on what regularly emerges from a deviant system, he must have a different system, it would have been preferable to state, as proposed in the amendment, that section 9 (4) to 9 (7) shall apply to any assessment of a registered child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is always within the Constitution and even if one wants to come down on the side of stressing <Col N="1397" /> the rights of the child above all other considerations, as I would do, we are also balancing the rights of parents. It is hard for a parent to accept that because he or she has chosen a different concept of education he or she has diminished procedures in law. The Bill appears to suggest that procedure A is appropriate once one has a perpetual trust in the State's formal school system. However, a separate procedure is appropriate if one exercises discretion and takes on a great burden. One can only justify such an approach if one suggests, for example, that it is required for the child's welfare. However, that is not the case being put forward by the Minister.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 34, after &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which may include recommendations relating to the education, the materials, the methods or the time spent, and to additional support to those providing the education which would ensure that the child is receiving a certain minimum education&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to make the process of assessment more supportive of the home education model when parents decide to take that difficult route. I envisage that the assessment would not only be in favour or against but would include recommendations relating to the education, materials, methods and time spent and additional support those providing the education could receive to allow the child receive a minimum education.</P>
      <P>The Bill envisages that a parent could be put on notice that he or she needs to improve certain aspects. The report would explicitly contain such recommendations and I outline areas for improvement. The board would provide a copy to the parent and give him or her a chance to respond to it. It is a different model from the one contained in the Bill which involves a decision being made and hearing a representation from the parent. It is a cold, unsupportive model whereas my model involves issuing recommendations, identifying areas for additional support, allowing the parent to respond and to indicate how he or she would deal with the recommendations and allowing the board to assess the response and the feasibility of obtaining necessary outside support where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> It would be a more supportive experience for both sides. They would consider how they could make it work rather than just hoisting a red flag and giving a certain number of days for the hearing of a representation from the parent before one is struck out.

      <P>Both amendments would have the effect of involving the board in a very direct way with the education of children outside the recognised school system. In my view, this goes further than is permissible under the Constitution or desirable in terms of the regulation of the education system.</P>
      <P>Where children are educated outside recognised schools, the State has only a very limited role in ensuring they receive a minimum education. This is how the Constitution deals with the issue. In the circumstances, it is not appropriate that statutory agencies should become closely involved with education delivery in the home. Nevertheless, I expect education welfare officers would try within these constraints to assist parents. However, this is different from creating a statutory obligation to do so. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>One of the Minister's points worries me. He mentioned the State's limited rights and obligations, but I question that if every child has a right to an education irrespective of where that education is provided. The argument that because one uses a system which is separate from the dominant State system, the State has diminished rights or responsibilities is wrong. That is not the case in relation to the rights of the child. The State can speak only of its limited remit in an administrative sense in so far as it may have looser administrative control over the option that is not the dominant option. However, it has clear obligations in relation to international treaties and other matters regarding the rights of the child.</P>
      <P>The Minister's comments are serious in relation to the idea that because a child is in an educational option that is separate from the national schooling system, he or she has less protection from the State. In law, that is not the case. One cannot argue that the State's role is diminished. One can argue only that there is a diminished remit in an administrative sense on the part of the State. The balance of rights exists. More importantly, in relation to the three parties who enjoy rights in this situation &ndash; the child, the parents and the educational institution &ndash; the primary holder of rights are the parents and the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has no basis in the Constitution or in law for arguing for a lesser interest. The Minister's comments can be construed only as the State trying to suggest that because children are in an alternative option, it can argue for a lesser interest. However, it cannot do so because that <Col N="1399" /> would be unconstitutional. The matter requires clarification.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins. I was shocked to hear the Minister say the amendment would represent too close an involvement between the State and a parent who was educating in the home. The suggestion appears to be that if one offers support and recommendations to help parents succeed, it would in some way step over the boundaries. The Constitution does not suggest anything of that nature.</P>

      <P>The Constitution states the State must ensure a minimum education is achieved to protect the child. This is entirely correct. The Constitution also states the State may confer resources on institutions to help achieve this end. My view is that this would apply equally to parents doing so. There is nothing debarring the State from providing resources to assist in this regard. The Minister is misinterpreting the Constitution if he is suggesting that it would be unconstitutional and undesirable to do as suggested in the amendment.</P>
      <P>However, I do not suggest that ultimately a parent cannot be debarred if the State finds through the board that he or she cannot achieve a minimum education for the child. However, if there is room to modify what the parent is doing to achieve the objectives of the State, every reasonable effort should be made to facilitate it. This is the purpose of the amendment. I do not understand how that represents too close an involvement by the State or trespasses on constitutional rights. The contrary is the case. The Constitution envisages the State offering such support.</P>

      <P>The option of judicial review is always open to a parent at any time. I note the point the Deputy makes in amendment No. 50 but I am concerned it could lead to an overly legalistic approach to the process of the registration of children. An appeal to the Circuit Court could conceivably set in train a process of appeal to the higher courts, which is costly and lengthier. In the meantime the child may be left in a vacuum without access to the minimum education to which he or she is entitled under the Constitution. I am satisfied that the appeals procedure already in place under the Bill will adequately deal with all situations which may arise. In addition, the normal remedies which people may seek from the courts, such as judicial review, are not affected by this provision.</P>
      <P>In this context Deputies might recall a recent High Court case involving a private school. The judge was reluctant to allow a school based issue become the subject of full judicial proceedings unless there was no other recourse. In the event, an alternative solution was found relatively quickly to which all parties could agree. I am sure Deputies will agree that, in general, this type of solution is more appropriate to deal with issues arising in the education system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us would not regard the example given by the Minister as a happy resolution nor as a great model. If an issue of rights is involved, it is better that it be adjudicated upon. The Department of Education and Science, since its establishment, has presided over a range of &ldquo;fix-me-up&rdquo; solutions which are far short of the conclusion of legal process and I do not regard any of them as superior to that conclusion. I happened to read in detail the case cited by the Minister. It begged the question whether, despite the fact that a solution was found, it was a happy resolution if the fundamental cause of the dispute was not adjudicated upon. I may appear conservative in the jurisprudence of this, but I prefer certainty and I am much more committed to the legal process than the Minister appears to be from both his example and what preceded it. It is not an argument to say that going to court could cost a great deal of money and that there is no knowing where it will end up. One would not seek an appeal to the Circuit Court on a frivolous basis. One would know that one was initiating a process. The argument that it is a long, drawn out affair with the child suffering in the meantime can be handled by regulation in another part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>My point about the Circuit Court is simple. Whereas a judicial review would involve a High Court hearing and would be much more expensive, the idea of using the Circuit Court is that it is faster, cheaper and an easier form of representation. The amendment requires that the judge exercise jurisdiction in the circuit where the child resides or receives education. That is for ease of representation. The arguments advanced by the Minister against the amendment are not convincing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must recognise that I have put in place an appeals system which involves a District Court judge. That is a simpler system which can be effective and involves the same legal understanding and knowledge. That is well covered. A judicial review, while involving the High Court, is normally a quick process which is not that expensive. In any event, an appeals procedure exists which involves a District Court judge.</P>

In the archives we have a reference to the martial airs suitable for boys and the soft lullabies suitable for girls, which lasted to the 1970s. There would be merit in publication even if it was only to place them alongside such precious archives. It is better to publish them and to state that in the Bill. There used to be the old thing of the cigireacht where knowledge was transmitted about what went on in the class. There was a way of mystically transmitting it to the teacher in the presence of a cigire in the classroom for a period of time. The Minister acknowledged it is a good idea to publish them.

      <P>&ldquo;(2) Guidelines and recommendations under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall include appropriate individual education plans drawn up for students with disabilities or special education needs.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I anticipated an argument about this amendment on the basis that this issue should have been dealt with in the Education Act, but it was not. A similar amendment tabled by my colleague to the Education Act, 1998, was not accepted. It was, therefore, necessary to table an amendment to this legislation to address the needs of people with disabilities or special education needs. An adequate inclusive definition of education welfare must advert to such special needs and to the cogency and power of having a specially devised plan. Otherwise, we will have to see how guidelines and recommendations can be teased out to handle such cases. However, if we recognise <i>ab initio</i> this set of needs, we will take care of them.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister's use of the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo;. I thought my amendment was clear in that it deals with categories of special need. The amendment refers to &ldquo;students with disabilities or special education needs&rdquo;. The Minister cannot deal with that by using the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo;. Perhaps he found a flaw in my term, &ldquo;individual education plans&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an assessment is done on a person with a disability or a special education need, it is better to handle the development needs of that person. Perhaps it would have been better if I had used the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;. However, that is not the case the Minister is making. I can put no other con<Col N="1405" /> struction on what the Minister is saying other than he has laid down general procedures and guidelines with which they can fit in and he will not draw up individual plans. How then will he deal with special education needs? They will either be handled in terms of categories of needs or based on an assessment and a personal education development plan. I am put out by the Minister's categorical response which is wrongly based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled. I understand the Minister is defining guidelines and recommendations which would help the board to establish whether a child is achieving a certain minimum education. There is no doubt some children educated in the home will have special needs. Perhaps those needs will be acute in cases where they have not been able to get appropriate placements and a parent chooses to educate them in the home despite serious learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is not clear how the Minister envisages setting guidelines for such children. This goes back to our earlier discussion about advice, support and responses from the board to support parents, which the Minister rejected. Perhaps he could clarify how he envisages dealing with children with moderate to severe learning difficulties or intellectual disabilities in the guidelines and general recommendations for children. He will have to do something along the lines proposed by Deputy Michael Higgins. I would be interested to hear any alternative wording he might prefer. There is no doubt many of the children educated in the home, for whom the Minister will be making guidelines, will have special needs which will need to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The amendment is broad enough to encompass children with disabilities. The main effort is to encourage children with disabilities in the mainstream. More support is being provided and this should help mainstream and specialised schools in the future. The definition is clear.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I am advised by experts about the guidelines that are necessary and the circumstances in which a need for them might arise. The terminology used in the section is broad enough to allow recommendations of a general nature to be made &ldquo;for the purpose of assisting the board in determining whether a child is receiving a certain minimum education&rdquo;. All children will be included under this provision and, therefore, the matters to which the Deputy refers are covered. Other matters will be dealt with in the guidelines in respect of which I, as Minister, will be advised by experts and specialists in the field.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how one can construe the language used in the section in the way the Minister desires. I am not imputing anything other than the best of intentions to him, but he referred to making recommendations of a general nature. I could envisage a situation where a specific need might arise and where the board <Col N="1406" /> might be approached and the process invoked. The board's reply would be that it was charged by the Minister to make recommendations of a general, not a specific, nature. However, the amendment deals with specific categories of need and refers to &ldquo;students with disabilities or special education needs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provision, as drafted, is vague. For example, if the Minister had put forward an oral amendment to the effect that section 15(<i>b</i>) should read &ldquo;make recommendations of a general and specific nature&rdquo; I could, with some confidence, withdraw my amendment. As it stands, I am asked to say the matters to which my amendment refer will be dealt with under the rubric of a general recommendation. That is far too aspirational, particularly as it relates to the students concerned.</P>

      <P>As it stands, the Bill provides that if a child is absent for ten minutes a parent is legally obliged by statute to give notice. The amendment suggests that an absence must be for a period of over two days before the obligation comes into force and that provision for prior notice should be made.

      <P>We are entering the realm of Alice in Wonderland. I ask Members to consider the Minister's comments while I read the text of the section, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> Where a child is absent from the school at which he or she is registered during part of a school day, or for a school day or more than a school day, the parent of such child shall, in accordance with procedures specified in the code of behaviour prepared by the school under section 22, notify the principal of the school of the reason for the child's absence.</P>
    <P>That is not consistent with what the Minister has just said.</P>
    <P>This section is a recipe for bureaucratic madness and it will be wide open to abuse. For example, a particularly troublesome teacher might ask a large number of questions and a parent could be virtually crucified in terms of trying to explain absences. Then there are cases where an extraordinary event &ndash; a bereavement or an accident or a national lottery win &ndash; might occur and it might not be unreasonable or inconvenient to give notice. An absence of two days or less is perfectly reasonable and does not require explanation.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that a notification under subsection (1) shall be made in writing or by such other means as may be agreed to by the principal of the school concerned. If the Minister is describing this as a flexible scheme which does not impose too many obligations on parents and schools, we are not reading the same Bill. I urge the Minister to consider the text of my amendment. I am seeking to substitute &ldquo;a period of more than 2 school days&rdquo; unless a parent has given advance notice of absence in regard to a marriage or some other joyful occasion or unless such absence arises from a family bereavement in relation to which it would be unreasonable or inconvenient to give notice. That would be reasonable, manageable, non-bureaucratic and fair to parents and schools alike. As it stands, one could arrive at the construction that if a student went out for lunch and did not come back for two class periods, his or her parent would have to explain his or her absence. Kafka would have appreciated the Bill as it is currently drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an over-riding provision that the school is not obliged to report on to the board until a child is absent for more than 20 days or if a child is consistently taking half days which add up to the 20 days. Every school will have a code of behaviour prepared under section 22 and the principal will decide on what absences should be recorded in that context. I am increasing the number of days from 15 to 20. I amended the Bill on Committee Stage when I stated that the Bill provided a balance between flexibility and effective reporting measures. As it previously stood, the notification procedure was seen as being overly bureaucratic and I amended the Bill to meet those concerns.</P>

      <P>In page 17, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a student has had problems relating to school attendance in a previous school, the school to which the application is made may request that the Board carry out an assessment of any special resources needed by that student and the capacity of the school to provide those resources.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 18 deals with the admission of a child to a recognised school and provides that a parent must make information available to the school and that the school cannot refuse to admit a child except in accordance with the code of practice. If a child has exhibited behavioural or other problems in one school, we clearly want to achieve a situation where such a child would be admitted to another school and supported, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes that where a student has had problems in regard to school attendance in a previous school, the school to which an application is subsequently made may request the board to carry out an assessment of any special resources required by the student and the capacity of the school to provide those resources. We want to ensure that when a child moves to a new school to make a fresh start, resources would be in place in that school to prevent the same problem as occurred in the original school recurring and to avoid the child coming into conflict with teachers. It would be desirable for some assessment to be carried out by the board in those circumstances in order that it could seek to ensure that the school could deliver the necessary support to the child in question.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 60 provides for an exchange of information between schools on a student's educational progress. The question of carrying out an assessment of needs should not arise on the transfer of a student from one school to another as this is a matter to which schools should always be alert. I would be concerned that this amendment, if accepted, could become a means through which some schools might seek to exclude low performing students on the basis that they do not have the necessary resources. I cannot accept the amendment but I reiterate that <Col N="1410" /> amendment No. 60 provides for an exchange of information on a student's educational progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear distinction between amendments Nos. 59 and 60. I understand Deputy Bruton's amendment to suggest that if a child has had difficulties in one school and envisages going to another school, such resources as might have been missing in school A will not be missing in school B and that the point of transition would be used to assess a child's needs in order that the transition to the second school would be effective.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 60 provides that the two principals shall, as the Minister put it coyly, have an exchange of information. The text of amendment No. 60 means that the school principals could exchange anything they might wish to exchange. They could have a good chin wag under subsection (5)(<i>a</i>) on any problems relating to school attendance that the child concerned had while attending the second-mentioned school referred to therein. That is obvious as they would not be seeking a change if such problems had not been experienced. Subsection (5)(<i>b</i>) means they could discuss such other matters relating to the child's educational progress as he or she considered appropriate. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister argues that Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 59 would in any way endanger the transition when the looseness of the drafting in amendment No. 60 does precisely what the Minister is accusing Deputy Bruton of. Amendment No. 59 has the merit of addressing the child's needs and I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has summed matters up very accurately. There is the risk that schools will seek to de-bar children who have experienced difficulties elsewhere and the one way one could ensure that schools could not unreasonably do that would be to ensure that their needs would be assessed and that the board would endeavour to ensure those needs would be met. We must allow such transitions to be genuine fresh starts where students would have the best chance of succeeding. For the Minister to say that my amendment might militate against a school accepting a child misses the point. The amendment is designed to make the transition a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that schools might seek to exclude low performing students. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to deal with the fact that we have a very high level of school drop-outs and very poor school attendance levels which are twice as bad as those in other European countries. These problems are concentrated in disadvantaged areas where children get into all sorts of difficulties and are either suspended for long periods or expelled. In some cases, parents may simply withdraw children from <Col N="1411" /> schools. That is why the State, through the National Educational Welfare Board, should support children on their transition from one school to another.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting the Government's failure to persuade or require Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to avail of the opportunity to explain his actions in regard to the Sheedy affair to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights; and</P>

    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;notes the nomination of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty by the Minister for Finance for appointment by the Board of Governors to a post of Vice President of the European Investment Bank.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <P>Mr. McDowell: I was a member of the committee set up by the House in 1994 to consider the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the then Fianna Fáil/Labour Government. As Members will recall, the appointment of Mr. Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court was central to the final act in that particular saga. One particular round of questioning stuck in my mind then and it has remained with me since. It transpired during the committee session that a Fianna Fáil member of the then Cabinet, who is still a member of Cabinet and was in the Chamber a short while ago, was dispatched to Mr. Whelehan's house in the early hours of the morning to seek his resignation as President of the High Court. I asked that Fianna Fáil Minister why he made the trip and put that particular request. He looked at me as if I had two heads and said simply and pretty plaintively, &ldquo;because the Taoiseach <Col N="1412" /> asked me to&rdquo;. The simple response tells us a great deal of what we need to know about Fianna Fáil and the way it treats the institutions of the State. There was no issue of the separation of powers or of whether the President of the High Court had done anything wrong which might merit a request for his resignation. It was purely and simply a matter of political expediency, of what suited Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil giveth and Fianna Fáil taketh away.</P>
    <P>In many ways this latest controversy brings us back into the same territory. The Fianna Fáil Party has looked after someone who they clearly sees as one of their own. This is elitism Irish-style. It is an elitism not based purely on money or the privilege which comes with birth but on the elitism and privilege which comes from being one of the boys, one of the circle of people who believe they have the right to rule and frankly believe in little else.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, spoke about the need to give Mr. O'Flaherty a second chance. Today the Tánaiste repeated this argument on the radio. The argument is specious and I will come back to it later if I have time, but the fact that it was advanced suggests a complete failure to understand or appreciate what the Sheedy case was all about. The Sheedy case was about far more than Mr. Philip Sheedy or the late Mrs. Anne Ryan; it was about the integrity of the criminal justice system itself. The Sheedy case said to people that there was one law for those who had access and influence and another for everybody else.</P>
    <P>Some Members may take it for granted that representations are made on behalf of people who are charged in the courts, but the general public was astonished to hear the Taoiseach had made representations on behalf of a person he had never met who was involved in a drink driving case. People were horrified to learn that a person could be released from prison as a result of an apparent chance meeting between a Supreme Court judge and another person somewhere on the south-side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves how did we get into a position last year when these resignations were required by Government. We got there because the Government made it clear in no uncertain terms that it would move to impeach the two judges concerned if they did not fall on their swords. We got there because the Chief Justice condemned the actions of the judges in a manner and using words which made continuation in office impossible.</P>
    <P>Last year we were told by the Government that the resignation of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty was required in order to restore confidence in the administration of justice. He was not fired just because he personally had acted in a fashion which was unwise; he was fired effectively because he had damaged faith in the administration of the justice system and it is in that context that his appointment to the European Investment Bank must be judged. If the forced <Col N="1413" /> resignation of the then judge was intended to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, what signal is sent by his appointment to the EIB? Surely the appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty can only serve to feed public cynicism about justice and politics, and about the way they interact here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in the House last week spoke about the need to restore public confidence in public life, but he did this, as we now know, in the clear knowledge that he had just collaborated in a decision which would have precisely the opposite effect. Clearly, the concern of the Taoiseach for the integrity of the justice system is secondary to his concern to look after one of the lads.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Taoiseach and, indeed, the Minister for Finance are entirely consistent with the Fianna Fáil value system, but the actions of the Tánaiste are beyond belief. I have a great deal of respect for the Tánaiste, a person who takes her politics seriously. I disagree with her on a range of issues but I have always found her ready to engage in a way which often other members of the Government are not. She is a person of integrity who cares about the integrity of our democracy.</P>
    <P>The more kind-hearted amongst us would have readily believed that the Tánaiste and, indeed, her party members had taken their collective eye off the ball or been outmanoeuvred, but today the Tánaiste gave the lie to this explanation in her performance on radio. She acknowledged that she had underestimated the strength of public reaction but then went on to say that she would have taken the decision anyway even if she had known what the public reaction would be. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and Deputy O'Malley professed that the decision was a mistake but the Tánaiste asserted that she would repeat the mistake if she had the chance to do so. By refusing to plea to the lesser crime of incompetence or making a mistake the Tánaiste has made herself complicit in a move by Fianna Fáil to give the two fingers to public opinion and, in particular, to those who were concerned about the implications of the Sheedy case. The Tánaiste might have been granted a fool's pardon but she has chosen to defend the indefensible and she and her party will be the big losers.</P>
    <P>Last week's decision came about because Fianna Fáil was determined to look after Mr. O'Flaherty and because Fianna Fáil could not care less about what anybody else might think. It happened because the Taoiseach wanted it to happen and the Tánaiste did not have the will or the nerve to stop it.</P>

    <P>This motion has little to do with public probity. It is not prompted by any genuine zeal for the public good. It is promoted by raw political <Col N="1414" /> opportunism and fuelled by the desperation of Opposition parties who are unable to come up with any credible alternative policies on the issues that really affect the progress of this country and the lives and conditions of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said last night that he had witnessed many strokes in his time as a politician but this appointment was the worst. The stroke by the Fine Gael Party of tabling this motion is one of the worst I have witnessed involving the mixture of a tragic accident at a Dublin roundabout and political opportunism in exploiting the events that ensued.</P>

      <P>But it appears that people and families must never get in the way of an Opposition's political machine in its quest to get back into power at any cost. The Dáil Chamber is the forum where political policies which impact on the lives of our people are discussed &ndash; that is what is supposed to be discussed here &ndash; but when one does not have any policies, this Chamber is reduced to a form of theatre, as we saw last night and will probably see tonight, in order to feed the frenzy of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but the Opposition does not want to focus on an outstanding performance. When one cannot attack a Government on its policies, one must resort to attacking them personally and no one, no family or nobody's tragedies must get in the way. If I might paraphrase a much quoted American political aphorism, our opponents sense that when it comes to the crunch at the general election in two years' time people will say, &ldquo;it's the economy and we are not stupid&rdquo;. The Opposition hope is that people have very short memories and are trying to forget that 12 short years ago this country, under the Rainbow stewardship, was at the point of bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>To anyone over 25 years of age these are not the woes of a distant past and so, confronted with the realities of our unprecedented economic success, the Opposition has in recent times tried to turn Dáil Éireann into a star chamber. Last night and tonight were typical. Some of what was said in here last night by Deputies Jim Higgins and Boylan could never be repeated outside the House. This chamber has now been reduced to a forum where character and good name are secondary to the Opposition's political machine.</P>
      <P>What we are witnessing here is the promulgation of a new puritanism. Like the puritanism of old it carries a nauseating stench of hypocrisy. The paragons of virtue and political correctness are ransacking every corner seeking out sin and brandishing threats of righteous fire and brimstone and political damnation. For a more suitable analogy one could go further back to the days of the holy inquisition. The new inquisition in the Fine Gael and Labour parties, like Torquemada, has no scruple about putting the families of perceived sinners on the wrack. Like Savonarola, how long will it be before they will start summoning children to testify against their parents? Have we now reached the stage, where because of one perceived error of judgment, a humane and learned man, who served the State and the legal system with distinction over many years must be thrown on the scrap heap. Any sensible assessment would surely conclude that it is foolish to deny the State and the European Union the talents and abilities of such a man.</P>
      <P>No reasonable comparison or association can be made between the controversy regarding Hugh O'Flaherty and what is emerging at the tribunals. It is not Hugh O'Flaherty's fault that the tribunals are ongoing at this time and doing a worthwhile job to the body politic. I hope that on their conclusion the majority of politicians will be restored to their rightful place as decent honourable women and men and politics restored as a decent place to practise. Yes, Governments have to make difficult decisions. What type of Government would we be if we were always to avoid making the decisions that we knew would cause such hassle? Difficult decisions will always have to be made. This is a right decision. He is the right man for the job. There were no negotiations with Hugh O'Flaherty in the period leading up to or after his resignation, neither in writing, on the phone, off the phone or in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards matters now being investigated by the various tribunals, I repeat what the Taoiseach has said. Fianna Fáil will deal forcefully with any <Col N="1416" /> person whose activities have besmirched the honour and integrity of our party. It must be done thoroughly and honestly but also justly and fairly. We have seen in the Fine Gael party, what can happen when, in a hysterical and hypocritical frenzy to appear purer than pure, decent and honourable people are made scapegoats. Tell me to mind my own business if you must, but like many Members, I am a reasonable judge of character and Liam Cosgrave is not a dishonest man. Medicine, it is said, is the only profession which, through its ongoing research and technology, continuously strives to bring about its own demise. I do not believe that anymore. Politics and some politicians, through the reckless accusations they are making, are striving to bring about their own demise.</P>
    <P>I am tired, and I believe this country is getting tired, of these paragons of virtue, ever ready to point the accusing finger, using the Dáil Chamber, to destroy the characters of an honourable and decent man and his family in an exercise of savage political opportunism &ndash; in this instance just to get at Flanna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>It may be time to take a long hard look at ourselves in our own interest. However, that is politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important the Government acknowledges that the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank has caused considerable public concern and an enormous amount of political controversy. Therefore, I take the opportunity presented by this debate to explain the circumstances which surrounded the nomination of Mr. O'Flaherty and my own role as Tánaiste in that matter.</P>
      <P>A number of weeks ago the Minister for Finance informed me that it was his wish to appoint Hugh O'Flaherty to the vacant position that would arise shortly in the European Investment Bank and he sought my support. After consulting with two of my senior colleagues we decided not to oppose the nomination of Mr. O'Flaherty. We had two options, to agree to the nomination or to seek to block it. On balance and in the circumstances, we chose not to block the nomination.</P>
      <P>I have always acknowledged that Mr. O'Flaherty behaved inappropriately in the Sheedy affair. He paid a high price for his inappropriate intervention and he brought to a premature and sudden end what had been a very distinguished legal career. The question arises as to why I did not raise objections to his appointment. First, he paid a high price. Second, there was the human factor. Everyone deserves a second chance. People on all sides of this House have made mistakes but have been given an opportunity, in different circumstances, to have a second chance. The Minister for Finance was seeking to give Mr. O'Flaherty such an opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> The fact that I did not object has caused considerable disquiet. I accept and understand that. Much of that disquiet arises from the fact that the Ryan family suffered such a huge loss. I understand the sentiment that derives from the very genuine feelings for the Ryan family which are shared on all sides of the House and I would never wish to cause offence or hurt to that family. I know everyone in this House shares the feelings expressed by the father of the late Mrs. Ryan today.</P>
    <P>The role of the Progressive Democrats in Government is to seek to act honourably, reasonably and responsibly. The role of any party in Government is not to block every proposal put forward by its coalition partners. It is ironic that in the past the Progressive Democrats have been frequently criticised, in this House and outside, for not supporting the advancement of some in public life. On this occasion we are being criticised for not objecting to the nomination of Mr. O'Flaherty.</P>
    <P>I will not take lectures from anyone in this House on the role the Progressive Democrats have played in Irish politics in the past 15 years, and particularly on the high standards we have sought to maintain in public office and outside it. No party has done more to put in place the tribunals and inquiries that are now bringing to public attention wrongdoings which occurred in the past. No Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has initiated as many inquiries as I have or stood up to as many powerful and influential people. It is rather opportunistic of people in the Opposition and elsewhere to equate the inappropriate action of Mr. O'Flaherty on the one hand with the corruption, bribery and scandal that is now dominating the news and emerging from both the Flood and the Moriarty tribunals. If reasonable and fair-minded people cannot differentiate between the two, is it any wonder that this nomination has caused such public disquiet? </P>
    <P>As the Chief Justice said in his report on Mr. O'Flaherty's, Judge Kelly's and the Circuit Court Clerk's roles in the Sheedy affair, Mr. O'Flaherty was motivated by a humanitarian concern and, although his actions were inappropriate and wrong, they certainly were not for personal gain. He paid a high price. Many in this House have often spoken privately over the past year of the pain and hurt he suffered about which there is no doubt. If this nomination were in some sense compensating Mr. O'Flaherty for what happened, I would have no part in it. If this nomination was a deal that was done on another occasion, I would not facilitate it or participate in it.</P>

I regret very much the controversy that has arisen, the pain and hurt that has been caused, the public disquiet and, indeed, the disquiet in my party. I understand all of this disquiet, in particular, because of the circumstances surrounding the Sheedy case and the hurt that was caused to the late Ann Ryan's family.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, I have known Hugh O'Flaherty since 1961 as a colleague at the Bar. We have been friends since then. I was also, as it happens, a member of the Government which appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1990. In the view of that Government and of those who offered their views from an enlightened position to that Government, he was eminently, almost uniquely, qualified both in terms of the range of his experience, standard, integrity and his commitment to serving this nation in whatever fashion would be appropriate. I was privileged to be associated with that collective decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> I was president of the Board of Governors of the European Investment Bank for a period in 1979 and I am quite conscious as is every member of that board of governors &ndash; the Minister for Finance even referred to this last night &ndash; that it is essential to have an appropriate balance and representation within the management committee of the European Investment Bank. Members opposite will have to recognise &ndash; I am sure they do &ndash; that there is a particular recognition that lawyers have an appropriate and significant role to play at that level, although I do not say that as a lawyer.</P>
    <P>Lest they have some doubts, I remind them that both domestically and internationally the precedent is there for lawyers to play a significant role in the management or regulation of banks. I mention the name of a very prominent governor of the Bank of Ireland who I knew at the Bar, Governor Bill Finlay. Being a senior counsel was his only qualification when he was appointed to that role. He came from a long and distinguished tradition within the Fine Gael party. No one raised a question about his qualifications then; we certainly did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman of Allied Irish Bank was a former Attorney General from the other side of the House. His qualification at that point was significantly that he was a very experienced and learned lawyer. I am talking about Peter Sutherland, who has demonstrated that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked what particular qualification did Hugh O'Flaherty have for the bank. Those opposite will be aware that a former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, for whom I have high respect, of whom I have a personal knowledge and with whom I am acquainted, has recently been appointed to the board of AIB.</P>
      <P>Leaving that aside, every bank in Europe and in the United States, of any standing, influence and repute, has prominent lawyers on their boards or management committees. Despite that, every Member of the parties opposite has had to ask what particular qualification Hugh O'Flaherty has as a banker. I would have thought it was a question of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>&ndash; if one only looked at the reality, one would see why without having to ask that question.</P>
      <P>Even on the board of the Central Bank &ndash; I am not making a case for my fellow lawyers &ndash;  there are two prominent senior counsels. That is not the first time this has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not surprising that there have been positive indications from within the European Investment Bank that it welcomes the <Col N="1421" /> appointment of someone of this status and experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With Hugh O'Flaherty's range of legal knowledge across all aspects of the law, both in practice and as a judge, why would it not welcome such a range of legal knowledge that would add to the balance within the management committee of the bank? That is of vital importance not only to the contribution which Hugh O'Flaherty can and will make to this bank but to the standing of the of the bank and how he would be perceived.</P>
      <P>I am not saying it was deliberate &ndash; I hope was is not &ndash; but some of the things said here, most notably last night, are calculated simply to undermine the character, credibility and status of the man who will go out there. I would hope it is not. Some of the comments made in the House, most notably last night, are calculated to undermine the character, credibility and status of a man who is going to serve at the European Investment Bank. What service is it doing to the bank, to this nation and to the professional capacity of people who serve at that level? I will not repeat the ill-informed, vulgar street abuse and name calling, of a kind children would not engage in, that we heard last night in this Parliament.</P>
      <P>I have reservations from time to time about the self-appointed gurus and the multiplying number of commentators in the Sunday and daily papers who comment on us. If we measure up to their standards we are deemed adequate but if when they make their almighty judgments on us we do not do as they wish and require, we are deemed to be inadequate and are sometimes scorned. Somebody might look at the growth industry of political commentators who drop in here for a few minutes to cover the Order of Business and then write a column about it on Sunday. There was a time when we had informed comment. It involved diligent study by the likes of Michael McInerney, Arthur Noonan and Michael Mills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not gossip. Not one of today's newspapers could bring itself to repeat the terms of the vulgar abuse issued here yesterday by the spokespersons from Fine Gael. They deliberately made way for Deputy Boylan and Deputy Ring to use the most vulgar, street calling abuse that children would not use. It did no service to themselves nor this Parliament. It did nothing to show any appreciation of the status of the job that Mr. O'Flaherty will be taking up. The man's name is Mr. O'Flaherty. A number of times last night I heard him referred to almost viciously from the other side of the House as Hugh O'Flaherty. It is a measure of the kind of commonplace, vulgar abuse we hear from the main Opposition party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The question was asked what hold does Hugh O'Flaherty have over the Government? I have probably spent more time in Hugh O'Flaherty's company over the past 12 months than I would have done at any other time for good reasons. I saw the impact the terrible trauma associated with the Ryan family and others was having on that man and his family. I tried to encourage him to come out because I knew the goodwill that was there for him. At no stage was there any suggestion &ndash; I think I would nearly have known &ndash; that Mr. O'Flaherty was trying to obtain a hold on the Government or that he was insisting on this, that or the other. From my knowledge and constant association with the man, the only reaction was embarrassment, hurt and, given his standing, perhaps a certain degree of understandable shame.</P>
    <P>Hugh O'Flaherty's salary as a Supreme Court judge was way below what his contemporaries at the Bar are earning. What is now being proposed for him is also way below those earnings. The Opposition must know that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>He got a good pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Opposition wants to give the impression that Mr. O'Flaherty's only interest in this promotion was to get a done deal for filthy lucre let them go ahead. It does not measure up either with the facts or the man. He could be earning much more had he stayed in practice, as some of his classmates and contemporaries are at this point. However, that may not appeal to some Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I understand and sympathise with those who have concern that people at the Inner Bar especially would earn such large sums of money when those of us involved in public service do not. However, let us not allow the Opposition to put about the notion that the only thing Hugh O'Flaherty had on his mind was money. If that was the case he would never have accepted the position of a Supreme Court judge.</P>
      <P>I take issue with the former Chief Justice's observations that Mr. O'Flaherty's interventions were inappropriate and unwise to the extent they could have damaged the administration of justice, even though he acknowledged it was done for humanitarian reasons. The same Chief Justice, in his valedictory words on his retirement &ndash; I was present in the court &ndash; uniquely made a specific point of recognising the unique contribution of Mr. O'Flaherty to the courts of this land, especially as a colleague in the Supreme Court. That was not mentioned in this House. Were the Members of the Opposition aware of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a unique and fulsome tribute made in open court. The Opposition should not just paint one side of the picture. Deputy Noonan said this appointment has stoked the flames of rumour. Who is stoking and rumouring? I know where the stoking is coming <Col N="1423" /> from. It may suit the media because they will always need something to whet the public appetite for more and more personal scandal, as if there is not enough of it already. Who is stoking the flames of rumour?</P>
      <P>In an otherwise temperate contribution, Deputy Quinn said that every member of the public suspects that Friday's act was the final act of some kind of arrangement. I do not know how he is in a position to know what every member of the public suspects. There is no record of a request or arrangement, sought by the Opposition because there was no such request. This man of honour and integrity is not that kind of man. His pride alone would not allow him to do that. It must be recognised that he did not make any such request.</P>
      <P>A report on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> today suggests that the appointment was the consequence of a lobby of barristers in the Law Library. I was in the Law Library today and spoke to every Fianna Fáil barrister I know. That is another piece of rumour mongering that does not hold up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the sterling defence of his personal friend by Deputy O'Kennedy. The appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty as the vice-president of the European Investment Bank is a nauseating and sickening example of politics at its worst. The performance of the Government in proceeding with this appointment is mind boggling and reckless and does no credit to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Progressive Democrats. It will prove to be the issue on which the Government is irreparably weakened. It will not be forgotten when the electorate next casts its judgment, which may be sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>This is not about Hugh O'Flaherty the man. It is about his appointment and the method of it. Fine man though he is and good company though he may be, the people have no explanation from him as to his involvement or otherwise in the Sheedy affair in which the death of Mrs. Anne Ryan was a central issue. Mr. O'Flaherty chose not to explain his position to the Oireachtas and through it to the people. His position was, therefore, bound to cause confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of being a Supreme Court judge is to behave like one. In this instance Mr. O'Flaherty made an appalling error of judgment. His pension was raised to £40,000 by the Government, actuarially assessed as £700,000 for his lifetime and he now finds himself being offered a salary of £140,000 with all its attendant perks. Mr. O'Flaherty should have refused this offer. Unfortunately for him and his family, his remembered legacy to <Col N="1424" /> the Irish people will not be of 40 years of judicial activity but rather having to remove himself from the Supreme Court in the face of a threat of impeachment by Government and being rewarded by Government later.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats admit<i>, mea culpa</i>, that they made a mistake, but want to carry on as people of integrity. Who do they fool? Balance the recognition of the truth of how wrong is this appointment against its continued presence in Government and one sees a nauseating and sickening performance. Its policy is to shout from the moral mountain, tell the people it is wrong but stay in there in case it never gets back. So much for integrity or a restoration of confidence in public democracy. This portrays a party living in never-never land, completely out of touch with reality and with the notable exceptions of Senator Keogh and Senator Martin Gibbons, a party with neither the courage or the conscience to face up to it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been less than honest in this matter. We have not heard the truth. We do not know who first proposed Mr. O'Flaherty, what assessment of his banking experience was carried out, who else was considered for this position, if anybody, and we do not know the truth behind any deals being done. We know that this appointment sends out all the wrong signals, that if one is in the circle irrespective of what one does or what misjudgment one makes, one will be better looked after as a result. It smacks of very low standards in very high places.</P>
    <P>I suspect that this appointment is not based on merit but on a deal being done, an offer made and a result achieved while giving a two fingered political gesture to the people in the process. That Ms Larkin called to the O'Flaherty home, either as a friend which she is perfectly entitled to do, or as a message bearer from the establishment, has added to the perception of the whole matter being politically incestuous.</P>
    <P>We may never know the truth of this, but like the Whelehan affair in the Reynolds Government, this will weaken this administration irreparably. It reminds me of the old saying of Cicero, <i>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, aures sacre fames</i>&ndash;&ldquo;What will you not compel the mortal heart to do, oh cursed lust for gold.&rdquo; It is a bad day for politics and it brings with it the final and ultimate humiliation of the Progressive Democrats. However, the people will have their say in due course and this incident will not be forgotten when they make their judgment on this arrogant and appalling administration which has descended to a new low in political principle and a new measure of absence of moral courage and conscience.</P>

      <P>When I heard the announcement on radio last week that this Government had nominated Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty for the Vice Presidency of the European Investment Bank, I was shocked. I could not believe they would contemplate such a move after all the controversy that had surrounded his resignation last year. Many of those unanswered questions on which the Government has ducked and dived and does not want to answer have been resurrected in this debate. Politics and the perception of politicians are at an all-time low and we are all bearing the brunt of that despite the fact that only a small number of individuals choose to abuse the trust the people placed in them. That the Government chose to offer this appointment to Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty in the current climate demonstrates how out of touch it is with the real world.</P>
      <P>I believed the revelations from the tribunals in a way were a welcome development, a cleansing exercise. We were facing up to the rumours that had been circulating for many years and the tribunals would restore confidence in our political system. Now, we are all under the microscope. For this Government to drop this bombshell is unfathomable. At one level, it smacks of political misjudgment but on another and more serious level, it indicates to the people that the Government does not care, it is not interested in regaining public confidence in politics and will do what it wants when it wants. This smacks of arrogance on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>We have heard much praise of Mr. O'Flaherty and his qualifications for the job as vice-president of the European Investment Bank. I have no doubt he is qualified and that there are many other people who are qualified for that position. Mr. O'Flaherty resigned last year as a disgraced judge. He was wrong in this actions. The Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, describes his intervention as being inappropriate and unwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the Fianna Fáil Deputies in this debate have expressed concern, <Col N="1426" /> with crocodile tears, about Mr. O'Flaherty but where was this concern last April when the mood in the Government and Fianna Fáil was that if Mr. O'Flaherty did not jump, he would be pushed? In yesterday's press, the media spin was that the appointment was Deputy McCreevy's job and he should be the scapegoat. It is interesting to note that in the Minister's speech on this matter yesterday evening, he attempted to defend himself from that spin by saying: &ldquo;I would like to assure the House that before making the nomination I had, in the normal way, consulted extensively with my colleagues in Government.&rdquo;  That is the Minister stating that he will not take the rap for a Government decision.</P>
      <P>Where does the Taoiseach stand on this matter? Speaking in the Dáil on 5 May last year, the Taoiseach took great credit for the fact that it was a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who obliged Mr. O'Flaherty to resign. Now the man Deputy Ahern was willing to impeach from the Supreme Court has superb qualifications for a job with a salary of £147,000 a year in the European Investment Bank. Who does he think he is fooling? This production is a three act farce. Act one involved Mr. O'Flaherty's irregular involvement in the Sheedy affair. Act two involved the Government forcing his resignation. Friday's appointment to the European investment Bank is act three of the farce.</P>
      <P>In his irrelevant contribution, Deputy McCreevy and other Government speakers in this debate have failed to explain the reason for this crazy appointment. The street-wise Taoiseach could hardly have believed he would get away with this. My theory is that he was angling for a general election. His plan was to use this appointment to cause a general election. His expectation was that the Progressive Democrats might refuse to back the appointment which would cause an election for which he would then blame the Progressive Democrats. It is obvious the Taoiseach is trying to create an opportunity for an election before further revelations from the tribunals expose more corruption and involvement of members of his own party and people close to himself. If the Tánaiste deserves any credit in this matter, it is that she saw the trap being set for her by the Taoiseach and faced with the dilemma of being blamed for causing an election, she took the morally cowardly step, in her own words, of not objecting to Mr. O'Flaherty's appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has admitted this evening that she only had two choices, to accept or veto this appointment. The Progressive Democrats decided to hang in because of their fear of an election. The Taoiseach, in his attempted conflict, has left the Tánaiste politically exposed and must have again seriously damaged the trust between the Government partners. If the Progressive Democrats had refused to support this crazy appointment last Friday, we would now be in a general election and the Taoiseach was hoping that the sensation of a general election would <Col N="1427" /> cloud the issue. I advise the Tanáiste to watch the Taoiseach between now and October. He is desperately trying to grab an excuse for an election, and claim it is not his fault. The Tánaiste should heed the words of his mentor, former Taoiseach Charles Haughey, who at the conclusion of the negotiations on the formation of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government on Friday, 18 October 1991 pointed to him and said, &ldquo;He is the best. He is the most skilful, the most cunning and the most devious.&rdquo;  She cannot say that she was not warned nine years ago.</P>
    <P>The members of the Progressive Democrats have admitted that they got it wrong. Everybody in the country knows they got it wrong. They should therefore support the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what we are doing here as Deputies. An appointment such as this should have been discussed in the House before a decision was made. At the very least, it should been discussed at Cabinet but it was not. It was not even discussed at an Oireachtas committee. We have the vision of the Minister for Finance dodging between Ministers getting the nod and wink of approval. Nothing was done in the open; it was all done behind the scenes and presented as a done deal, which the Tánaiste says cannot be reversed. This is a load of rubbish. A job such as this should not be in the gift of an individual Minister. It should be discussed openly beforehand. The person nominated for the position should not have any unanswered questions hanging over him or her.</P>
      <P>We are told that Mr. O'Flaherty is extremely able, eminent and learned but he should have known better when he made the decision, which has been termed a mistake, to involve himself in the Sheedy case. Because he is so learned he knew at the time that by involving himself he was doing wrong. He still has questions to answer and until these are answered he should neither be nominated for nor, in all honour, accept this position. He carries a stain on his reputation that he has failed to clear and which he will carry to Europe where he will represent Ireland. He has a flawed pedigree which he has refused Deputies the chance to investigate and himself the chance to clear. He made a decision. He knew what he was doing and was caught. He would not have been caught except that the unfortunate Mr. Sheedy was seen walking down the street. He is now to be rewarded not alone with a very generous pension but with a job which carries a salary of up to £3,000 per week plus expenses, costs, perks and God only knows what else.</P>

    <P>I call on all Deputies of conscience, especially the Progressive Democrats, to show that the House does not approve of this appointment at this time. In a speech in Cobh over the weekend the Attorney General said the Progressive Democrats was the only party whose Deputies do not lose the Whip when voting on a matter of con<Col N="1428" /> science or judgment. This is the time to stand up for what is right. This appointment is wrong while questions remain unanswered. If Mr. O'Flaherty can answer these questions and clear his name let the appointment proceed. Last year the Government threatened to impeach this former judge. It did not take that decision lightly. Was the Government wrong then?</P>

When Hugh O'Flaherty was appointed to the European Investment Bank the only words that the majority of the people could think of were, &ldquo;Sheer brass neck arrogance.&rdquo;  This has been the hallmark of Fianna Fáil going back to the 1960s and the mohair suits. I was around at the time and witnessed what it could do when it received an overall majority. The Lord help this country if it ever receives another, because it is inbred in Fianna Fáil to clean the place out.</P>

It was shocked again today when it heard that a former Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil received £8.5 million over a period of 17 years. It is a while since I was in school but this works out at approximately £1,400 per day, not a bad sum.</P>

    <P>The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance remind me of the Bermuda Triangle. Anybody who has ever got between them has disappeared. The Minister for Foreign Affairs disappeared. Two judges disappeared, one of whom has bounced back because he is an honourable man. He was also an honourable man when he disappeared. One Minister said that Fianna Fáil has been in power for 55 of the last 80 years, since the formation of the State. That is democracy at work but never before have so many people disappeared under one Government. One <Col N="1430" /> day advisers were there, the next day they were gone. The question that is being asked the length and breadth of the country is, &ldquo;When is the Government going to disappear?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach wrote to the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, last Thursday to tell me that he was setting out how he plans to proceed to develop a comprehensive and considered approach to creating a durable legislative framework to underpin confidence in the political system. The next day whatever confidence was left in politics was well and truly kicked in the teeth by the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil nomination of former judge Hugh O'Flaherty who had shunned an Oireachtas committee seeking to get to the bottom of the Sheedy affairs and who by his actions, no matter how naive, had lowered the respect in which the Judiciary is held. The Green Party believes this appointment should not be made. It smacks of a deal done in a smoke filled room. To a public punch drunk by scandals it is the Devil looking after one of his own, or her own in the case of Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>This blatant political patronage raises serious questions. Were other qualified candidates considered for this lucrative position as vice-president of the European Investment Bank, as for the post of EU Commissioner? Why was the position not advertised given its importance and the need to vet the qualifications of any applicant? Why was there no independent appointment procedure as is normal for the most mundane position in the service of this State &ndash; the Local Appointments Commission being one example? Who is to prove that this nomination is not a pay-off for Mr. O'Flaherty taking the heat, along with his two colleagues, over the Sheedy affair? Is it not the case that the political handlers had to cut a deal to ensure their own survival? Otherwise, why would the wily Taoiseach, the cocky Minister for Finance and the high moral ground Tánaiste feel compelled to unilaterally spring this fresh controversy on a deeply cynical public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is awash with well qualified people so why was there no interview process? If <Col N="1431" /> any legal eagle wants to stand a good chance of advancement in their profession, they have to not just align themselves with a political party but they have to be socially and politically well in with their political masters and mistresses. This nomination reminds us of what is worst in the old school tie political patronage which sickens me and so many of my constituents. If they have a conscience, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil should examine it closely. Confidence in the Judiciary and the political system depends on the outcome. If they do not have a conscience then at least let them consider the sensitivities of the bereaved Ryan family in Tallaght.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Everything that is repugnant in political life in this State is brought to light with the appointment of former Supreme Court judge Hugh O'Flaherty to the vice-presidency of the European Investment Bank. Fianna Fáil is blatantly handing out patronage to one of its friends for reasons we do not know, but we have our suspicions.</P>
      <P>The vice-presidency of the EIB carries a salary of £147,000 per year. This highlights the absolute vulgarity of the European gravy train. It would take 15 years for a low paid worker to earn what Mr. O'Flaherty will earn in one year, courtesy of Fianna Fáil's patronage. The Government was prepared to allow a situation where Mr. O'Flaherty would be able to draw a pension of £40,000 per year from the taxpayer. My amendment to the Fine Gael motion &ndash; which I will support &ndash; which calls for the repeal of section 2(1)(a) of the Act providing for this pension, has been partly met not by the Government but Mr. O'Flaherty saying he will forego the pension. However, that is not enough and the Government must repeal that legislation forthwith.</P>
      <P>This appointment starkly points up the sickening double standards in the political establishment. I do not believe that someone should be crucified for life for one mistake. However, look at how poor working class people are crucified daily in the District Court for offences largely arising from the effects of poverty and deprivation. For them, there are no lengthy deliberations in tribunals or tickets to the European gravy train but usually summary judgment and the inside of a prison cell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, a sentence of six years was passed on an unfortunate young woman who was a heroin addict for stealing a handbag containing less than £1,000. However, three years after their unmasking, there is anonymity for the Ansbacher crooks. The appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty is the political establishment looking after its own in the most blatant and cynical fashion. This makes a mockery of the pious hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that they take seriously the need to root out corruption, patronage and cronyism. It also makes a mockery of their pretending to be serious about rooting out all that is rotten in Irish politics. By this act they <Col N="1432" /> consolidate and affirm all that is rotten in politics with the patronage of the establishment, the strokes and the giving of favours.</P>

      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion. The air in the McEvaddy villa in the south of France where Deputies McCreevy and Harney have their holidays must be rare indeed. It has produced a mood of harmony and peace between these two Ministers and between them and the Taoiseach which allows them to weather debacles such as this without a ripple in their relationship.</P>
      <P>I read the speech which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, read in the House last night which was an extraordinary performance. He tried to present himself as the figure of blind justice, wisely selecting the most eminently qualified candidate for the post of vice-president of the EIB without fear or favour. However, he could not disguise the favouritism which led to this appointment. It was cronyism pure and simple. The Minister claimed that when Mr. O'Flaherty realised that his seeking to remain in office as a judge was threatening to compromise the integrity of the Judiciary, he did the honourable thing and resigned. However, we all know that he resigned after the Government notified him that if he did not do so he would be impeached.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked if we are entitled to condemn such a man for the rest of his life for making a mistake for which he paid a huge price? The answer is no, but that is not the question. The question is should a man who was found to have acted wrongly in the Sheedy case and whom the Government threatened with impeachment be elevated to one of the most lucrative jobs in the EU?</P>
      <P>The appointment of Hugh O'Flaherty is entirely inappropriate given his failure to account for his role in the Sheedy affair before the Oireachtas and the Chief Justice's strong criticism of his role in that affair. I opposed the legislation in the Dáil last year which awarded a very large pension to Mr. O'Flaherty and I share the public anger at this appointment. The issue, as far as the public and I are concerned, is not the personality of a judge but the credibility of a Government.</P>
      <P>We should all be conscious that at the root of this affair is the tragic death of a young woman at the hands of a drunk driver. The case put a question mark over the impartiality of the justice system. It was seen to operate in favour of those with privilege and those with the right connections. The injustice was compounded by the three very special and generous pension arrangements provided for in legislation by this Government. Could workers in any but the most elite professions expect such privileged treatment? Of course not. The injustice has been further compounded by this appointment. It is not too late. Rejecting the views expressed concerning the irreversibility of the decision I call on the Minister for Finance and the Government to withdraw this nomination.</P>

      <P>In many ways the Minister, Deputy Fahey, summed up the Fianna Fáil ethos when he talked about Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. He said that he did nothing unethical or illegal. My approach is not to point the finger at Mr. O'Flaherty but at the Government because it is appointing him to the post in Europe. However, I cannot allow the Minister's comments to pass. Would the Minister not consider unethical the actions of somebody who was found by the Hamilton report to have intervened in an inappropriate and unwise way? Would he say it was not unethical for somebody to intervene in a way that was damaging to the administration of justice? We should be honest and say that Mr. O'Flaherty's actions were contrary to his oath of office and the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it was not unethical. That probably explains the actions of the Government because it does not know what ethics are; that is the ethos of Fianna Fáil. The Minister's statement sums up the outlook, culture and ethos of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never known such public outrage about a political decision as I have witnessed regarding the nomination by the Government of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty as vice-president of the European Investment Bank. I share this sense of outrage. The appointment ranks among the worst ever made by a Fianna Fáil led Government. To some extent, it reminds me of the appointment of Mr. Harry Whelehan to the Presidency of the High <Col N="1436" /> Court and the subsequent loss of office by Fianna Fáil on that occasion. Perhaps that is a message for the Government.</P>
    <P>This appointment is, and will be, seen as a further nail in the coffin of a discredited coalition Government. The public has been deluged with allegations of sleaze, sludge and scandal. So far it has given the benefit of increasing doubt to this Administration. However, the public, correctly, has lost patience with the Government on this issue. It is easy to understand the public reaction to this decision. As Members can see, the matter is the headline in today's <i>Evening Herald,</i>&ldquo;Is this justice?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it away. The decision is arrogant and insolent. It spits in the face of Ann Ryan's bereaved family. It is at best a mistake and at worst corrupt. It should and can be reversed.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Progressive Democrats Party admitted that the decision was a mistake and now is her opportunity to follow through with the logical consequence of that admission, which is to ensure that the motion is passed and that the Government's decision is either withdrawn or overturned. This is what should happen; it is a logical consequence of the Progressive Democrats Party's current position.</P>
      <P>This debate is not about the qualifications of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. Other than the fact that he has no experience of banking, I accept that he was an eminent jurist. That is not the issue. In my opinion, it was his eminence that made his conduct in relation to the Sheedy affair all the more culpable. The public and the Dáil are entitled to answers. The Dáil deserves an explanation but it has not got it. The House did not receive any explanation from Mr. O'Flaherty for his actions and nor did the Oireachtas committee. The Government has not explained why this extraordinary decision was made. There is no explanation from the Taoiseach about his role in the entire affair. He has not explained his representations on behalf of Philip Sheedy, the fact that he sent his close associate to see him in Shelton Abbey or that his partner, Ms Celia Larkin, was the first visitor to the O'Flaherty establishment following his resignation. Who knows what his role in the affair has been since; we have no explanations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has not explained his role or why he promoted this extraordinary appointment. Are we to continue giving blind support to a Government that treats this House and the country in this fashion? Most important, there is no explanation from the Progressive Democrats. Half of the Fianna Fáil Party is clearly against the proposal and the entire Opposition is against it. The Progressive Democrats Party has now admitted that the decision was a mistake and an error. In that situation, why <Col N="1437" /> are they continuing to persist in propping up the Government, particularly regarding this decision?</P>

      <P>As I listened to speakers on the Government benches, it occurred to me that, while former judge Hugh O'Flaherty might be unfortunate in his enemies, he is particularly unfortunate in his friends because the two Deputies who claimed friendship with him made the most pathetic, incompetent and irrelevant defences of his character, good name and appointment that I have heard for a long time. He is not fortunate either regarding the Ministers who defended him. The Minister for Finance, who proposed his appointment, gave a child's guide to the activities of the European Investment Bank and accompanied it with a series of assertions that the man needed a second chance and Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty was the most suitable person for the job. That is all he did. He did not explain anything nor did he justify the action. He simply made assertions in a trivial speech which, if it does anything, contributes to the deliberate dumbing down of Parliament by this Administration, and it does not need much more of that.</P>
      <P>Ministers and Deputies on the Government side might have heard Mr. Tom Kirby, the father of the late Mrs. Ann Ryan, in his interview with Marian Finucane this morning. He is a very forgiving man who believes people should get a second chance. He forgave Mr. Philip Sheedy. He said that, as in Mr. Sheedy's case, what Mr. O'Flaherty did was an accident and should be considered in that way, that he did not do it with any malicious intention. However, he went on to say that &ldquo;they knew what they were doing, and that what they have done has made a better job for the man who resigned&rdquo;. I believe that &ldquo;they&rdquo; in that sentence is the Government which the Deputies opposite support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the Progressive Democrats position. Its members admit they have made serious mistakes in agreeing to the nomination of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty as vice-president of the European Investment Bank. Being sorry is not enough, and the Tánaiste must take steps to ensure that the Government does not proceed with the nomination. Mr. O'Flaherty is not a suitable person for this position. That has been clearly demonstrated in the House. The Tánaiste has now admitted that there has been public outrage at the prospect of this appointment, yet she is not prepared to do anything to rectify the situation. To proceed to implement the decision, which she knows is wrong and which, on her own admission, is causing public outrage, is holding both the Dáil and the people in contempt. She <Col N="1438" /> wants it both ways. She is like the penitent who confesses sin but has no firm purpose of amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a pretence put abroad by the Progressive Democrats that the O'Flaherty appointment has passed the point of no return, that it is a <i>fait accompli</i>, that it can do nothing about it and that we must grin and bear it. That is not the position. The European Investment Bank has confirmed to Fine Gael that the Irish nomination is not urgent and can be changed. There are three vacancies for vice-president arising in the EIB at present, one of which will be filled by an Irish nominee. There will be a meeting on 5 June but it does not have to be filled on that date and we have been informed by the EIB that it can be filled by an exchange of letters. That is precisely how the Spanish intend to fill their vacancy later in the month of June. There is no urgency about it; it is reversible. If Progressive Democrats members want it reversed, they can say to the Taoiseach that they will not accept it, that a mistake was made, that there is public outrage about it and that they should reconsider and appoint someone more suitable for the position than Mr. O'Flaherty.</P>
    <P>I argued that Mr. O'Flaherty was ineligible for this position on the grounds of unsuitability arising from the Sheedy case. I also believe he is not qualified for the job. The Government has asserted that he is uniquely qualified for the position, and Deputy O'Kennedy reasserted that when he referred to lawyers on the boards of banks. However, this is not an appointment to a supervisory board. This is an appointment to a hands-on, full-time banking job where one must assess investment decisions and where one must supervise professional bankers.</P>
    <P>I obtained the list of the other appointees and it makes interesting reading compared with Mr. O'Flaherty's lack of qualifications. The President is the former deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance of Belgium. He was also Minister for Economics and Budgets. The French vice-president was head of financial markets, a senior treasury official, a former director of the World Bank, of the European Investment Bank and of the Bank of Central African States. The vice-president from Austria was the former chairman of the Austrian Postal Savings Bank and was a professor of economics at the University of Vienna. These are people with direct banking, economic and financial experience and are the type of people being appointed. The person from the United Kingdom is a senior UK treasury official with long experience in financial administration. The person from Germany is an economist and a former director of several German banks. The person from Greece is the former director of the Greek Industrial Development Bank and a former chairman of Eurosec, which is the largest Greek financial company. The person from Spain is the former executive president and chairman of the Spanish export credit insurance board and was a senior Spanish civil servant in the Ministry <Col N="1439" /> of Trade. The person from Italy is a former senior official of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The person from Holland is a former Dutch deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Economic Affairs and Minister for Justice and a former senior manager with the Unilever group.

I believe the EIB is very unhappy about Ireland's appointment. It has signalled this, especially in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, where an EIB spokesman pointedly said that there was no time limitation on the nomination and that, if there must be a change, it can be made. He also said it was a practical institution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The EIB is the world's largest multinational borrower and lender and has a large professional staff. In effect, it is a huge global bank. It manages more funds than the World Bank. Mr. O'Flaherty will not be in a supervisory position but in a hands-on banking position and he will be expected to adopt a hands-on approach. He will also be involved in borrowing on the world's capital markets and in assessing projects for EIB funds, such as transport projects, telecommunications projects and environmental protection pro<Col N="1440" /> jects. What does he know about borrowing on the world capital markets and assessing huge infrastructural projects? There is nothing in this eminent jurist's background which makes him suitable for this job. Not only is he unsuitable, he is unqualified.</P>
    <P>The EIB also manages the debts of countries and reschedules their loans. Mr. O'Flaherty will have a major say in the management of the national debts of some countries. What qualifications does he have to manage the debts of European or Third World countries? Would the Government consider him suitable for a similar job in Ireland? I am glad the Minister for Finance is present because he might answer the question. Would he consider nominating Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to run the National Treasury Management Agency?</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Eircom IPO Price.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this most important and disturbing matter. This morning was another of those cold bath mornings when we awoke to hear some new horror. This time is was the chief executive of Eircom, Mr. Alfie Kane, who told us that it was his view last July and is his view that the price of 3.90 at which the Government sold the Eircom shares represented a 30% premium over their real value. He stated at the launch of Eircom's annual report, further to his interview with Ms Harney on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, that he made known his views at that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that the board agreed this, but what seems to have been forgotten is that some months before the IPO she axed any member of the board who was not of her political hue and put on the board her own people, including a former ministerial colleague, Mr. MacSharry, as chairman. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to me that the board was prepared to merely rubberstamp a Government decision and would not go along with the views of their chief executive.</P>
      <P>The only issue in this debate is simple. Were the half a million people told the full story? I believe they were not told about Mr. Kane's view that the stock was being overpriced by 30%, but they also were not told the full story about Comsource. The reason the price of these shares fell to a record low of 3.24, their lowest level ever, at close of business at 5.30 p.m. this evening with a pessimistic prospect is there is a potential overhang on the market of 776 million shares from KPN and subsequently from Telia. It is rumoured that they are prepared to take 2.90 per share. That outlines just how the public was hoodwinked by the Minister. My understanding is that those companies, in their talks with the Department, stated that they wanted more than 35% of the company and in such circumstances they would be long-term stockholders. The Government said no and they said they would be short-term stockholders. While it is true that it was written in the small print of the prospectus, it was never publicly enunciated that the likelihood was not only that they could get out after six months but that they would get out after six months. The public was not told of Mr. Kane's views or about the rapid exit of KPN/Telia and Comsource.</P>
      <P>Permanent damage has been done to the IPO process. People will not have their fingers burnt again. They will not be taken in by balloons, red smoke and people coming down ropes with champagne bottles. That type of thing will not work again.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by a copy of the speech the Minister is about to deliver which I received from a civil servant in her Department. It is rather pathetic, bearing in mind that the share price at IPO was set in July, that in the last paragraph she quotes comments from me from as far back as 22 April 1999, when I stated that this is not a risky investment; it is a sure bet. Eircom is a sound business and the telecommunications sector is a sound sector. I do not withdraw any of that, but I was not to know then that the people would register first and the price would be decided afterwards when they were locked in and captive purchasers of this stock. That will never be allowed again.</P>
      <P>The Minister must now explain when she knew first of Mr. Kane's views and when she knew that Comsource would only be around for six months. If she knew in July 1999, she concealed this successfully from the public. It is clear that when the Minister's political career is over she will find it easy to take a job as a second-hand car sales person because she bought and sold the public on this issue. She has succeeded in ensuring that people bought a pig in a poke and are now left with a loss of 15% plus their expenses, and maybe more. This debate is not about scoring political points but about Ministers giving answers about what they knew and when they knew it.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to come into the House to reply to this matter. The following information was sent to every shareholder. There is no difference in the size of the print of any statement within it; it is all the one size. It states clearly:</P>
      <P>Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to sell any of their Shares for a period of 6 months from the completion of the Offer, but will be free to sell their Shares thereafter . . .</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring is a member of the board also. Would Deputy Carey allow me to speak? The final price of £3.07 was halfway within the price range. The balance sheet of the company was very strong and the price for Eircom was set by the Government on the basis of what the market was prepared to pay.</P>
      <P>As I stated, the strategic partners in Eircom, that is KPN and Telia, were prevented from selling their shares and each shareholder received this information which states, they &ldquo;will be free to sell their Shares thereafter&rdquo;, immediately after six months.</P>
      <P>The pricing of the shares was a delicate one of balancing the need for a fair price for taxpayers and the need for a fair return for the investors. In fact, Deputy Rabbitte, whose political acumen I really value, stated in the House that I was like a street vendor in Moore Street selling fruit at half-price and that I had let the shares go for nothing &ndash; it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the day following the share sale. Many economic commentators in Sunday and daily newspapers stated that we had done the taxpayer wrong and sold too cheaply.</P>
      <P>The Government could have chosen to float the company at a higher price, but it chose not to do so. As the House will be aware, the launch price was £3.07. In the first three months of this year&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the dramatically changing situation in South Lebanon and its effect on Irish troops serving there. Will the Minister outline the measures being taken to ensure the safety of Irish troops serving with the UN in the volatile area of South Lebanon? </P>
      <P>The situation in the former Israeli security zone of South Lebanon has dramatically changed over the past 48 hours where a number of Irish troops are deployed and the situation could deteriorate rapidly. Irish troops yesterday patrolled inside the former Israeli security zone for the first time and the situation is unlikely to be stable for quite some time.</P>
      <P>The Israeli backed South Lebanon army collapsed faster than anyone had imagined. Revenge and retaliatory attacks are inevitable in the days ahead with a likely major upsurge in violence. Furthermore, there is grave uncertainty as to the intentions of the Hizbollah who may opt not to disarm but to continue to launch attacks on Israel. I note that the Irish contingent of 550 is to be increased to 600 but what steps are being taken to ensure the safety of Irish troops in the days ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people are proud that our troops are playing a key role with UNIFIL and have done so for a long time. I seek the assurance of the <Col N="1449" /> Minister that their security is the number one priority at all times. A number of other questions arise. Given the extraordinary pace of change in South Lebanon and the totally changed circumstances, have any steps been taken to review the mandate of the troops and how does the Government intend to proceed with this? What discussions have taken place? I understand that 100 troops were requested and that 50 are currently in training. Can the Minister give the House any further information on the timeframe of this request, the likelihood of 100 troops going to South Lebanon and for what period?</P>
    <P>It is important that any new status of forces agreement should include the UN Convention on the Safety of Personnel. Is the Government satisfied with the current security measures surrounding Irish troops, the back-up measures in place and any emergency plans which may be necessary? These questions must be answered. It is important that we reassure the families of the troops serving in the Lebanon and explain the situation to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak tonight on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, who is at present visiting Irish troops in East Timor.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this matter and for giving the Minister for Defence the opportunity to inform the House of the up to date position which has unfolded since last weekend, and the implications of those developments for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &ndash; UNIFIL. The Minister for Defence has been in touch with the Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL and with the battallion headquarters in Tibnin and I am glad to report that all Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL are safe and well. While the situation in South Lebanon is described as tense, it is not considered that Irish battallion personnel are at risk as a result of the recent turn of events. However, the situation will continue to be monitored in consultation with the United Nations headquarters in New York and with personnel on the ground.</P>
      <P>The Israeli Government declared its intention to withdraw its forces from Lebanon not later than July 2000. United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 requires Israel to end its presence in South Lebanon. UNIFIL was established to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with UNIFIL since 1978. On 4 April 2000 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL, comprising approximately 620 personnel of all ranks for a six month period beginning 19 April 2000. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of <Col N="1450" /> approximately 620 personnel of all ranks to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peace keeping force beyond July 2000. The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the UN Security Council every six months. In January last it was decided to extend the mandate until 31 July 2000.</P>
    <P>The UN has been engaged in ongoing contingency planning for the post-withdrawal situation. The UN Secretary General's special envoy, Mr. Larsen, who recently visited the region reported to the UN Secretary General who, in turn, reported to the UN Security Council on 22 May 2000. The Security Council, which considered the matter again yesterday, <i>inter alia </i>welcomed the Secretary General's decision to send his special envoy to the region again, to ensure that the requirements put forward by the Secretary General to enable UNIFIL to discharge its mandate are met and that all parties concerned are committed to co-operating fully with the UN in the complete implementation of Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978.</P>
    <P>In terms of UNIFIL troop strength, the Secretary General has indicated that the confirmation process may require an increase in strength of the force. The UN Department of Peace Making Operations, briefed UNIFIL troop contributing countries, including Ireland, in New York yesterday afternoon. It was confirmed that leaders at the highest level on both sides had offered assurances regarding co-operation with the UN and that the players on the ground were acting generally in a responsible manner. Actual and potential troop contributers were urged to accelerate their consideration of the request made by the United Nations headquarters for extra troops for UNIFIL but no commitments were asked, expected or given. The UN Secretary General's special envoy is returning to the region today, arriving in Beirut this evening.</P>
    <P>The situation on the ground in South Lebanon as reported by the military authorities is as follows. In the days leading up to last weekend the Israeli defence forces withdrew from some positions in South Lebanon and handed them over to the surrogate South Lebanese Army (SLA)/<i>de facto</i> forces (DFF). This appears to have signalled to the Lebanese people who once lived there and to the resistance armed elements, the Hizbollah and AMAL, that an opportunity was being presented to reclaim these areas. This resulted in an influx of people into the towns and villages of the Israel controlled area of South Lebanon which began last Sunday. Many SLA/DFF personnel surrendered or fled. This ignited the total collapse of the SLA/DFF and appears to have left the Israelis with no option but to withdraw from all positions in the area which they formerly controlled with the exception of a number of permanent violations along the border which they still occupy. The expectation is that Israel will withdraw to the international border but it is unclear at this stage as to when this process will be completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> The collapse of the SLA/DFF and the withdrawal of the Israelis, was, fortunately, marked by a low level of violence. It is estimated that between five to ten civilians were killed and up to 30 injured. There has been good co-operation between the IDF and UNIFIL. The Lebanese Army has not deployed southwards yet but the Lebanese Government has indicated a willingness to deploy its security forces into the vacated areas, and there is some evidence that this is happening. Members of Hizbollah/AMAL can be seen patrolling within two kilometres of the Israeli border. UNIFIL, including armoured patrols from Irish battalions, has been patrolling in the former Israeli controlled area today. Irish battalion patrols have been welcomed in all the towns and villages they have visited and the mood of the people is described as up-beat.</P>
    <P>An Irish battalion patrol visited the hospital in Bint Jubayl, one of the largest towns in this region, yesterday. It found that it had been abandoned by its doctors and that most medical supplies had been taken. The senior Irish medical officer has since been to the hospital and is arranging the procurement of essential supplies.</P>
    <P>While Ireland remains committed to UNIFIL and is anxious to see its mandate discharged it goes without saying that the safety of Irish troops is of paramount concern to the House, the Government, to the Opposition and to the people and this will be a critical factor in our approach to the emerging situation. In common with other troop contributors, Ireland would regard it as essential that there are adequate security assurances before considering deploying any additional Defence Forces with UNIFIL. I expect that my colleague, the Minister for Defence, will fully brief the Government on this matter next week and I assure the House that any actions which can be taken to ensure the maximum safety of Irish personnel will be put in place as necessary. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter tonight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau deserves to be complimented on the manner in which it has gone after the assets of the drug barons &ndash; the results speak for themselves. Likewise, the national drugs unit has had spectacular success in its ongoing multi-million pound drugs seizures. In spite of all this, the battle is being lost. Every day the queue of heroin addicts is growing. The <Col N="1452" /> recorded 15,000 heroin addicted persons in Dublin in 1998 has grown to more than 16,000.</P>
    <P>The battle is being lost on several fronts. It is being lost on the consumer front. In spite of the additional resources, the various drugs initiatives are not penetrating into the drugs heartland of the south inner city Dublin flatland. The battle is being lost on the retail front. In spite of the good intentions of the local drugs task forces, the drug peddlers, the dealers, the pushers and the middlemen continue to operate with virtual impunity as they push drugs daily on street corners and in school yards. It is being lost on the socio-economic front because many of those addicted come from areas where there is not any employment, facilities, hope or future.</P>
    <P>Rosie Lakes was 21 years of age. She was a chronic heroin addict and she died from contaminated heroin last Friday and was buried yesterday. Carl O'Shea was 29 years of age. He was a heroin addict and died last Thursday in St. Vincent's Hospital from contaminated heroin. Maureen Gleeson was the mother of two children and she died in her Crumlin flat from contaminated heroin. Their deaths bring to eight the number of heroin addicts who have died from contaminated heroin over the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>An RTE radio programme today captured the mood, the fear and the helplessness of the frightened drug population when one addict replied that he was &ldquo;too desperate to stay away&rdquo;. Another said there was not enough methadone, while another said there was not enough help. Warnings from the Eastern Regional Health Authority will be of no avail unless some substitute or more methadone is provided until the source of the lethal supply is established.</P>
    <P>There seems to be certain common denominator factors. All the deaths seem to be in the south western section of the city. Some of those involved certainly availed of drugs from the same source and supply. The heroin in question turns green instead of brown when mixed with water. What is certain is that there will be further deaths unless the contaminated supply is found. We wish the Garda well in their task of trying to establish where this supply of poison drugs has come from, who supplied the lethal drugs and what is the agenda.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me. Given this epidemic of eight deaths and a number of other close calls where people were saved by the medical services, I would have expected a statement from the Government before now. Even at this stage, I would expect the Minister for Health and Children to bring together his colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister Tourism, Sport and Recreation, who has responsibility for local development, and maybe the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ndash; I mention him for a particular reason &ndash; to co-ordinate a response to this. It may not end at eight deaths; we do not know. It very nearly did not end at <Col N="1453" /> eight deaths as a number of people came very close to dying in recent days.</P>
      <P>The reason I suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs become involved is that there appears to have been a similar epidemic in Glasgow recently. The source of that may be the same as the source here. Furthermore, it has been alleged to me by a journalist that there was a similar epidemic in Dublin in recent weeks and a similar number of people died. Much of this is unsubstantiated but what is substantiated is that eight young people are dead and probably most of them were from my constituency. I know two of them are and I recognise a third name. I do not know the names of all eight victims. More people could have died and more may die. It needs a co-ordinated response.</P>
      <P>Research done by a group in Crumlin shows that eight in ten young people do their leaving certificate but the figure is one in ten among those who abuse heroin. Those people do not read the newspapers or listen to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or other radio programmes. They do not even listen to the news on the more popular younger people's programmes. We need to ensure the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Garda go to the haunts which these people frequent warning them of the danger they are in. Furthermore, we need to know if this supply of heroin was recklessly, without mercy and knowingly put on the market so that people's lives could be terminated and put in danger in this way. A multi-departmental approach is needed.</P>
      <P>If this was a car crash in which a number of people were killed or a small aircraft crash, there would be a major inquiry. There would be statements in this House and Ministers would co-ordinate a response. That is the sort of response needed to this development. This is a very serious and grave development which is of enormous concern. I hope we do not find that this epidemic becomes a pandemic. We need to take this matter in hand. I cannot recall in one area so many young people dying in such a short period of time from such a terrible source.</P>
      <P>I express my sympathies to the families and friends of those who died; they were all only young people. I read about Ms Lakes from my constituency, who sat her mother down when she was only 15 years of age and told her she had something to tell her. Her mother thought she was going to tell her she was pregnant but, according to the report, she told her she was a junkie. She died this week at the age of 21. This needs an adequate co-ordinated inter-departmental response. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Saturday I visited a number of households neighbouring the Lakes family home in Crumlin. In each one of those homes a sense of sorrow and anger was palpable. Every second person I spoke to said that Rosie Lakes came from a good and caring family and that she was a <Col N="1454" /> fantastic young woman who potentially had a great future. However, ultimately, this young woman got caught up in the vicious cycle of heroin abuse. Her life was wasted and that of her family has been torn apart.</P>
      <P>If it were not for the courage of Rosie Lakes's parents, who yesterday courageously went public with their grief at the death of their young daughter, the sudden upsurge in media and public attention would never have happened. Yesterday, St. James's Hospital reported that eight heroin addicts had died in its care over the past two weeks. A further three addicts have been reported dead today. Until the Lakes family spoke out this series of deaths was completely undocumented. The air of suspicion surrounding the deaths of Rosie Lakes, Carol O'Shea and Maureen Gleeson have concerned me and I am glad the Garda Síochána has instigated an investigation into the matter.</P>
      <P>However, what worries me more is the fact that people are dying every week as a result of heroin and the response by the Government has been near to zero. It appears that while the majority of people have begun to rise on the crest of our growing economy, those communities who have always suffered the brunt of poverty have now been forgotten again. The drugs problem has been allowed to fester without notice.</P>
      <P>The unacceptable spate of heroin related deaths in this city should act as a wake up call to the Government. In 1996, the network of drugs task forces was established to co-ordinate the various sectors in the prevention and treatment of drug addiction. In general the task forces have played an important role in ensuring better delivery of services and amenities in drug ridden communities. I understand the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs is anxious to ensure cross-party support for the work of the task forces. It is very important to ensure that all task forces are working effectively at producing positive outcomes within specific time frames. The operation of these bodies cannot be left to chance.</P>
      <P>Health board estimates suggest that there are 13,000 heroin addicts in Dublin alone. These estimates are based primarily on the number of people who are receiving or seeking treatment. The real figures are likely to be much higher. Our current rehabilitation facilities and spaces on methadone maintenance are over stretched. Young teenagers who seek help in these programmes are put on waiting lists and by the time their number is called it is unfortunately too late for many of them. Meanwhile, many of these youngsters end up in the revolving prison door syndrome and their families are forced to their wits end while pushers remain on the streets luring more and more people into the vicious net of addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are making money on the backs of misery may even be guilty of selling low grade heroin, which may be at the core of the recent spate of deaths. Despite the zero tolerance policy of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1455" /> Reform, drug ridden communities remain under policed. Turf wars, self appointed police agents and balaclavas are still an unfortunate reality for housing estates and flat complexes in this city.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister for zero tolerance announced another new 700 prison places. Will they serve to house addicts whose problems intensify during their incarceration? To date, there has been little effort to introduce adequate treatment to the prison system and, clearly, prison is not the answer to the drugs problem. Before creating these new prison places did the Minister care to consider that by investing in proper treatment for 700 addicts he would cancel out the need for the prison places in the first place?</P>
    <P>The stories of recent heroin related deaths have been horrific. It is a reminder to us all that the heroin problem has not gone away; if anything it is more solid than ever before. This week should be a turning point in our drugs policy. We should set about creating a drugs policy where prevention and cure are given every resource needed. Youngsters should be supported through education and amenities so that they do not end up in the web of drug abuse, while those presenting themselves for treatment should receive the treatment they need within a short time frame. After treatment there should be education, employment and housing opportunities which offer real hope for a drug free lifestyle. I conclude by offering my sympathy to the family of Rosie Lakes and to the other young people who died tragically last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Jim Higgins, Gay Mitchell and Upton for raising these important questions. I share their concern and the concern of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Ryan, and of the Eastern Regional Health Authority on the recent deaths from heroin. I too extend my deepest sympathy to the families of all those concerned.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the Eastern Regional Health Authority has issued warning notices to all of the clinics for staff to be extra vigilant and to report any unusual and unexpected illnesses or symptoms to medical personnel. The notice also advises clients to seek medical help immediately if they develop any unusual or unexpected effects or illnesses. The area health boards are sending similar notices to all GPs in the area. General practitioners and all staff are being asked to report back to the area health boards any relevant information which may help to clarify the causes of the recent deaths of heroin misusers in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alert arose from reports that 20 injecting drug users were admitted to hospitals in the Glasgow area in the two weeks ending May 15. Nine of the 20 died and some of the others were admitted to intensive care units. Fifteen of the 20 cases admitted to hospital were women. The illnesses <Col N="1456" /> that were caused in Glasgow appeared to be related to injecting heroin into tissues which caused severe damage and extensive necrosis. In severe cases there was a rapid deterioration over a number of days which developed into a septic shock syndrome.</P>
    <P>A European wide alert in relation to this matter was issued last Friday. This came to the ERHA department of public health through the National Disease Surveillance Centre in Dublin. The ERHA passed the information on to the chief executives of the accident and emergency hospitals in the region and asked that it be brought to the attention of the staff working in accident and emergency departments and that the hospitals would feed back information if they had similar cases here. As of yet, no hospitals have come back to the ERHA indicating that any of the cases in the Dublin area were similar to the Glasgow cases.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has informed me that the Garda Síochána is investigating the deaths of a number of persons who were admitted to hospital within recent weeks. The Garda Síochána is awaiting the results of toxicology analysis which have been conducted.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has also informed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that 50 street deals of heroin have been seized over the past four weeks as part of operation cleanstreet. These are currently being analysed in the forensic science laboratory in Garda headquarters. To date, more than two thirds of the 50 samples have been analysed and there is no evidence of contamination in any of them. The Garda Síochána is liaising with the hospital authorities in examining any recent reported fatalities which may be linked to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive range of structures has been put in place to address the drugs problem. Fourteen local drugs task forces have been established in the areas where the drugs problem is most acute and over 200 projects are under way in local task force areas. Thirteen of the task forces are in the greater Dublin area. In addition, through the youth services development fund a range of initiatives are under way aimed at children and families at risk. A Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs works to co-ordinate activities on an inter-departmental basis to address the problem. The national drugs strategy will be further reviewed this year with the aim of ensuring that properly co-ordinated and integrated structures and services are being put in place.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area services are provided through more than 50 treatment locations. Two new clinics have recently been opened in the Crumlin/Drimnagh areas. Services at an existing clinic in James's Street are being expanded. Treatment services are provided in clinic settings and by over 125 general practitioners.</P>
    <P>Priority is being given to special programmes <Col N="1457" /> targeted at young persons. Nine education officers have been recruited to work with schools and local communities on the development and delivery of drug prevention programmes and a further three are currently being recruited. Three rehabilitation co-ordinators are creating links between drugs treatment services and the range of agencies who provide rehabilitation options for drug misusers. The authority also provide support to the voluntary and community groups whose work complements that of the statutory services.</P>
    <P>The current budget for the services in the ERHA area is in excess of £20 million. The key priorities are completion of the network of community based treatment services and increasing the emphasis on primary care and services; the development of specialist services for young persons; the development of treatment services in the prison system; measures to regularise the prescribing of benzodiazepines; the development of specialist responses for the probation and welfare services; the development of additional capacity in the treatment services to deal with referrals from the drugs courts service; the development of rehabilitation services; and the development of a patient charter. It is also proposed that three further clinics will be reopened.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the network of clinics it is hoped services will be available on demand for addicts as they present. The ERHA has informed me that as an emergency measure the number of areas for which the mobile bus provides a service is being extended.</P>
    <P>A recent independent report on the drugs services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority found that there has been a remarkable degree of activity and expansion within the services in the ERHA over the past four to five years which has led to one of the more innovative community drug service programmes in Europe. Regarding prevention, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has many initiatives in place to reduce drug addiction among young people. The health promotion unit with the Department of Education and Science and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre has developed substance abuse prevention programmes for primary and secondary schools. These programmes entitled, &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; and &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, respectively, are aimed to enable students to develop their ability to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives.</P>
    <P>The national youth health programme is a partnership between the National Youth Council of Ireland, the health promotion unit and the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science. The aim of the programme is to develop health education resources and to provide training in health issues specific to young people. Its resources include the youth work support pack which was developed by the National Youth Council for dealing with drugs issues and provides a framework for exploring individual <Col N="1458" /> roles in relation to the drugs issue at organisational level.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Drugs Questions Local Answers&rdquo; is an ongoing community based programmed to help participants cope better with the drug related problems which they meet. The course is designed for people working and living in local communities to help them identify local drug problems and to develop local responses to these problems. The health promotion unit has run convenor training programmes for this pack in conjunction with the eight regional health boards.</P>

      <P>As a result of these courses a large number of convenors have been trained to use this pack. The health promotion unit has developed a wide range of educational materials including leaflets, posters and postcards for young people which provide information on all aspects of drug abuse. I assure the Deputies that both the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, are totally committed to tackling the problem of illicit drugs, including heroin.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem did not arrive overnight and neither can it be solved overnight. The Deputies will appreciate that there is no quick and easy solution. The Government's approach to the problem of drug misuse has been and remains a two pronged approach with strong legislation supported by tough law enforcement measures on the one hand and a multi-agency integrated approach targeted at reducing the demand for drugs on the other.</P>
      <P>This policy of strong legislation and increased resources backed up by tough law enforcement is vital to tackle the drug problem. For example, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which has been successfully utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activity from enjoying the benefits of their ill gotten gains and the recent Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which substantially strengthened the law relating to drug trafficking provide for a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This policy of strong legislation backed up by tough law enforcement has resulted in record drug seizures, many Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled, major drug barons fleeing abroad and a high percentage of persons prosecuted being convicted and sentenced to prison. This Government's anti-crime policies are yielding the anticipated good results with a further fall of 5% in crime figures last year leading to a cumulative fall of 21% since we took office. In addition, we are also on target for increasing prison capacity in an unprecedented <Col N="1459" /> way. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also believes that the new restrictions on bail should prove particularly effective in helping to tackle the drug problem. The correlation between drugs, crime and social disadvantage are well documented and in this context a multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the problem at a local level is the cornerstone of the Government's national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>I accept that we must continue to have drug misuse as a priority area for attention and that further work is needed to prevent young people turning to drugs in the first instance while working to ensure that appropriate treatment and rehabilitation facilities are provided for those who need them. My Department will continue to work in a co-ordinated fashion to tackle the problem and to halt the upward trend in drug misuse.</P>
    <P>In the context of this present unfortunate situation I know that all the agencies are doing their <Col N="1460" /> utmost to identify the reason for the recent deaths. The ERHA, in particular, is keeping all its staff on high alert and is actively in touch with the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals to monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 36 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95 and £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by the Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in terms of the scheme. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Southern Health Board that Cork University Hospital is unaware of any case where non-consultant hospital doctors were forced to refer a case to the Labour Relations Commission for payment of outstanding salaries. The board has informed me that where discrepancies in salary payments for hours worked occur, the medical administration department, together with the head of the specialty involved, meet with the non-consultant hospital doctors concerned and adjust payment where warranted.</P>
      <P>In relation to unrostered hours, the Irish Medical Organisation sought an investigation of hours worked by non-consultant hospital doctors at Cork University Hospital between July 1999 and February 2000. The two sides agreed to refer the issue to a third party for arbitration. The arbitrator issued recommendations on 13 April 2000. Cork University Hospital have accepted the findings of the arbitrator. The Irish Medical Organisation have agreed to ballot their members on the findings.</P>
      <P>On a national level, Deputies will be aware that difficulties have arisen for both health service employers and junior doctors regarding implementation of the 1997 contract. I welcome the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission and the agreement which was reached between the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation on 16 May 2000. The package agreed includes improved overtime payments and the appointment of senior managers to deal with difficulties that arise in relation to the rostering of junior doctors. It was also agreed that the parties will work towards the elimination of continuous periods of duty.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the remaining agenda will be held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. It is now important that a comprehensive deal is agreed over the next number of weeks to ensure a genuine reform of the system and a proper management framework for hours worked by non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Regional Health Authority concerning this matter. I have been informed that at present Mater Hospital public patients are transferred to St. Luke's Hospital for radiotherapy. Public patients who require urgent radiotherapy are referred to the Mater Private Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The cost of this service is met by the Mater Public Hospital.</P>
      <P>In the interest of delivering an integrated service to public patients, I understand that a proposal is presently being considered by the Mater Hospital, whereby the hospital would purchase radiotherapy services from the Mater Private Hospital, thus eliminating the need to transfer public patients to St. Luke's Hospital. This proposal, when formulated, will be submitted to and considered by the Eastern Regional Health Authority within the context of the hospital's overall priorities for 2001 and the many competing demands which presently exist within the acute hospital sector in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, both hereditary and acquired, is the responsibility of the health boards. In accordance with the recommendations of the review group report on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities Towards an Independent Future, regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been established in each health board and bring together the statutory and voluntary sector services providers, the consumers and their representatives for the better planning and co-ordination of services at regional level. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health board in consultation with their regional committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Western Health Board, in consultation with its regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services, <Col N="1465" /> has identified the provision of rehabilitation centres in County Galway and County Roscommon as top priorities for development. The board is currently working on plans for the Galway Rehabilitation Centre to be located in the grounds of Merlin Park Regional Hospital. It is proposed that the plans will be completed by the end of the year 2000 with building to commence in 2001. It is proposed that the rehabilitation centre will cater for clients who present with serious physical and cognitive deficits resulting from accidents.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients, the novel foods regulation, which came into force in all member states on May 15 1997. Under this regulation, novel foods and food ingredients are those foods and food ingredients which have not &ndash; as of May 15 1997 &ndash; been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which fall into certain categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently two genetically modified products authorised for sale in Ireland and the <Col N="1466" /> EU &ndash; a genetically modified maize and a genetically modified soyabean. These two products were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC, on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment, before the novel foods regulation came into effect. Because these two products are primarily used as ingredients in processed foodstuffs, it is not possible to determine the percentage of food in Ireland to which genetically modified ingredients have been added.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has been mandated by the European Parliament to encourage the development of validated methods for the detection of protein or DNA resulting from genetic modification.</P>
    <P>The Commission's Joint Research Institute hosted a meeting on methods for the detection of GMO-derived foodstuffs in Ispra in Italy last November. Ireland was represented at this meeting by the State Laboratory. One of the conclusions from this meeting was the urgent need for horizontal networking between national enforcement laboratories with a view to discussing and comparing research and analytical data. The JRC is currently establishing such a network to discuss such issues as the development of co-ordinated testing methods or approaches and increasing the synergy between the European laboratories; the organisation of collaborative ring trials for testing of materials containing GMOs; the development of co-ordinated sampling strategies; investigation of best practices; compendium of common views on the interpretation of regulatory requirements; and co-participation in larger research networks.</P>
    <P>A second meeting will take place in the Joint Research Centre in Ispra in June. Ireland will be represented by the State Laboratory, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>It is intended to designate the Food Safety Authority of Ireland as the competent authority for the novel foods regulation. The FSAI will monitor genetically modified food and food ingredients for compliance with relevant legislation on an ongoing basis as part of its regular food surveillance programme.</P>
    <P>It is planned to designate the State Laboratory as the reference laboratory for the detection of GMOs in Ireland. The State Laboratory uses the most up-to-date technique, competitive polymerase chain reaction. This technology is now considered the most applicable and the one which is normally used. It provides a &ldquo;presence&rdquo; or &ldquo;absence&rdquo; answer. Despite the increasing demands for quantitative methods for the detection of GMOs, qualitative methods will also be needed for the detection of new GMOs. They will continue to be the basis for the development of quantitative methods and for screening before quantification.</P>

The main service, training, research and career issues, and the principles and approaches to be adopted have, to a large measure, been agreed by the Medical Manpower Forum. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This is necessary if one of the key principles of the forum is to be achieved, the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals. This will require an increase in the present number of hospital consultant posts.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the forum's first report, it is proposed that the next steps should be an assessment of the effect of the changes recommended in a representative number of hospitals. This assessment will take into account the changes in medical staffing required to give effect to the recommendations of the forum. It is envisaged that the assessment should be completed in six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the House yesterday, the commission on nursing has signalled that the future benchmark qualification for entry to the nursing profession will be a degree in nursing studies.</P>
      <P>There are currently a large number of registered nurses and midwives pursuing part-time degree courses. However, there are variations between health agencies in the provision of fee support. The priority action plan agreed between my Department and the nursing unions for the implementation of core recommendations of the commission on nursing includes a commitment to the introduction of uniform criteria for the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration education courses. This has provided me with a unique opportunity to create a level playing field for the payment of nursing degree fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> I have accordingly decided that from 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in our public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to quantify the number of nurses who will benefit from this decision but it is estimated that up to 1,500 nurses a year will avail of the new initiative over the next five years or so, at an additional annual cost of £3 million.</P>
    <P>This initiative is designed for the benefit of nurses who do not already have a degree, and includes fees for access courses and nursing degree courses undertaken through distance education. It will apply to nurses employed in the public health service in either a temporary or permanent capacity. Certain nursing management and health services management degree courses will come within the scope of the new fees initiative.</P>
    <P>The commitment to continue working will be for one or two years, depending on the duration of the degree course. The new scheme will be sufficiently flexible to allow nurses to change employment within the public health service after they have completed the course.</P>
    <P>An important objective of the initiative is to provide an assurance to graduates from the three-year diploma programmes that they will have an opportunity to undertake a part-time nursing degree course and have their fees paid. I hope that this will act as a real incentive to newly qualified nurses to enter the workforce following registration and to remain in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that this initiative applies to part-time nursing degree courses only. The educational fees of the students currently undertaking the full-time degree course in NUI, Galway will not be covered under the scheme. As I have said in the House on many previous occasions, NUI Galway introduced the full-time nursing degree course against the wishes of my Department and the Higher Education Authority, both of which favoured the development of a part-time course in line with the approach adopted by other third level institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The health boards have statutory responsibility for the control and prevention of infectious diseases, including measles, under the provisions of the Health Acts 1947 and 1953 and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has indicated to my Department that up to 19 May there have been 804 cases of measles in its area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The situation is a cause for concern and the ERHA has indicated that a range of control measures have been implemented. An outbreak control group has been set up and this has met on a regular basis and has recommended a range of control measures to be put in place in the affected areas. General practitioners have been alerted to the situation and asked to ensure that all children of appropriate age are vaccinated. Special vaccination clinics have been established in the affected districts and, also in these areas, for the duration of the outbreak, the age at which children may receive their first MMR vaccination has been reduced from 15 months to six months. Information has also been promulgated through the media about the risks associated with measles infection and the advisability of immunisation. The situation is being monitored by the ERHA on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>While the current outbreak has so far been concentrated in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, since MMR uptake in all health board regions is below 95%, there is a risk that outbreaks will occur elsewhere also. My Department has recently written again to the health boards, stressing the importance of achieving high immunisation rates to prevent the further transmission of measles infection. I strongly urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to concerns which some parents may have about the MMR vaccine, the available evidence about this vaccine has been examined and the advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has been sought by my Department. All of the expert advice available to me is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and either chronic inflammatory bowel disease or autism. This is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue. Recent media reports on this issue relate to an alleged association between measles and autism. However the research concerned has not been published and so independent experts, both in Ireland and elsewhere, have been unable to <Col N="1470" /> examine the evidence for the statements which have reportedly been made.</P>

      <P>This Government is providing unprecedented resources for the development of the health services. A total of £4 billion will be spent this year, just two years after the total net expenditure in the sector passed the £3 billion for the first time. Funding for specific service developments in the acute hospital sector this year stands at over four times the level provided in the final year of the last government's term of office. This is facilitating a number of substantial initiatives with a view to ensuring that the acute hospital services are reformed, re-organised and properly geared to meet the need of our population. They include the recently launched cardio-vascular health strategy including developments in cardiac surgery, the continuing implementation of the national cancer strategy which is improving the availability of cancer treatment services throughout the country, the development of renal services which will involve an investment of £20 million over the next three years, the establishment of a medical manpower forum to review the key aspects of medical staffing in public hospitals; and <Col N="1472" /> a range of other initiatives in such areas of acute hospital governance and management developments, clinicians in management, hospital accreditation, laboratory accreditation and health technology assessment.</P>
      <P>The range and scope of developments to be undertaken in each agency under the various areas is agreed between my Department and individual agencies as part of the annual service planning process. Within this context the actual number of consultant appointments that will be made in a given year will be influenced by timing factors associated with the recruitment process, including the level of response to advertisements, the need to schedule interview boards, the availability of suitable candidates and the length of notice required by existing employers.</P>

      <P>The concerns expressed to me by the chairman and director of the centre in relation to the decision to locate it in the midland region relate principally to the position of staff who may not wish to relocate from Dublin and to whether the centre could function as effectively if sited outside Dublin as it could if it remained in the capital. I am considering the points which they made and I will communicate with them as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not set the standards or level of skills at a technical level for particular posts. Such requirements are determined by employing authorities in the light of the role and function of particular posts. However, non-consultant hospital doctors as doctors in training receive much of their experience on the ground from practical application. While I do agree that the advanced cardiac life support course and the advanced trauma life support course would be of benefit to junior doctors who are in training for positions in accident and emergency medicine, this is not necessarily the case for every junior doctor who spends time in an accident and emergency department and is training for another specialty.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, many non-consultant hospital doctors undertake these courses to increase their knowledge and skills. My Department funds a scheme where course fees and examination fees are reimbursed. This scheme is administered by the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board and support for the advanced cardiac life support course and the advanced trauma life support course is available since 1998.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the widespread availability of benzodiazepines on the black market; the contribution which this is making to the problem of drug abuse; if he will take immediate steps to tackle the problem of over prescription of these drugs by general practitioners by the introduction of strict protocols; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998 had a major impact on limiting the availability of methadone on the illicit market. The situation regarding benzodiazepines is, however, not as clearcut as for methadone. Even in health board treatment clinics, benzodiazepines may be legitimately prescribed to drug misusers, so there is an issue around determining clinical guidelines for management of drug misusers and appropriate dosages of various medications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's officials have written to all general practitioners on a number of occasions concerning the need for them to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs, including benzodiazepines. In the most recent letter, 30 August 1999, from my Department's chief medical officer to all general practitioners, he advised doctors to contact health board GP co-ordinators on best clinical practice in relation to treatment of opiate misusers, and he gave contact names and phone numbers where assistance could be obtained. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 <Col N="1474" /> and 1984, of course, I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where a need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
    <P>My Department has requested nominations from various interested bodies to represent them on a committee which I am establishing to examine benzodiazepine prescribing. This committee will make recommendations on how misuse of these drugs can be reduced or eliminated and I expect their first meeting to be held sometime in June.</P>

These commitments relate to ongoing initiatives that carried forward into 2000 from previous years and new approvals that have been issued in the current year.</P>
      <P>Given the extent of the programme, and the fact that most of the minor capital expenditure is administered on a global rather than an itemised basis by my Department, it is not practical for me to list each project currently within the board's approved capital programme.

    <P>A major hospital development programme is planned for both acute hospital groups within the North Eastern Health Board, including all five hospital sites. These include replacement equipment and refurbishment works, including the provision of standby generators, fire precautions, maintenance, health and safety works, etc; community mental health grants; high support unit for older persons, Dundalk; grants for services for persons with disabilities; health centre capital developments; orthodontic unit, Dundalk; new nursing units at Virginia, Ballyconnell; and high support unit for children, Castleblaney.</P>
    <P>New approvals granted to date in 2000 include the refurbishment of the Redeemer Community Centre in Dundalk and the relocation of the <Col N="1475" /> Regional School of General Nursing to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, I announced last week under the national development plan the provision of £8 million additional capital funding to the board for equipment and refurbishment works in 2000. This sum will be prioritised by the board in the hospital and non-hospital areas. Other possible initiatives for the board's area for this year will also be considered by the board and my Department.</P>
    <P>In general, the question of what projects in the North Eastern Health Board area are funded this year, and the extent to which they are funded, depends on the drawdown by the board for individual projects as liabilities mature for payment.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the results of a survey carried out at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in October 1999 on patients and families of adults and children who have acquired brain injury and who had been in-patients at the National Rehabilitation Hospital. I have been informed that the final report of this survey will be available shortly and when it becomes available, I will have it considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>Regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been established in each health board and bring together the statutory and voluntary sector services providers, the consumers and their representatives for the better planning and co-ordination of services at regional level. From 1997 to December 1999 an additional 73 posts have been created, including an additional 17.8 physiotherapy posts and an additional 95 respite places have also been created to provide services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including people with acquired brain injuries. Each of the health boards is in the process of establishing multidisciplinary assessment and treatment centres which will play an important role in the initial assessment of children and adults with hereditary or acquired disability.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to the development of community based services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including services to adults and children with acquired brain injury. Since coming into office, additional funding of just over £67 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of community based health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. In line with the recommendations of the review group report, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department is a matter for the management of each health agency.</P>
      <P>There are particular difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of disciplines, particularly in the medical, paramedical and nursing areas. Action is being taken on a number of fronts to address these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The medical staffing of hospitals is currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine.</P>
      <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to paramedical grades, it is clear that the balance of supply and demand for the three therapy grades, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists needs to be reviewed. As a first step, I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the Higher Education Authority to investigate the possibility of increasing the number of graduates taken into the courses for speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists from October 2000. I am confident that progress can be made on this issue. Talks are also ongoing to ascertain if additional places can be made available to students on courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have agreed the terms of reference for a workforce planning study for these three grades and this is a priority issue for my Department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that difficulties are being experienced in other areas of the allied health professions, such as social workers, care workers and physiological measurement technicians. I intend to refer these matters to the health services skills group, established under the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions with the Academy for Medical Laboratory Science, I am pleased to say that from October 1999, the number of entrants to the three approved medical laboratory science courses in Ireland has been increased by 20 per annum. I have also funded the creation of a new student medical laboratory technician post. Entrants to this grade have completed a degree programme but lack the required clinical placement. This programme addresses that lack by providing a one year placement. The first of these new graduates will have completed their training by May 2000 and will be available for employ<Col N="1478" /> ment once accepted by the Academy for Medical Laboratory Science.</P>
    <P>A service review of psychology services in the health boards is under way, with manpower planning one of the three main areas for action. It has been decided to adopt a two-pronged approach to the problem, one in the short-term, for example, over five years by increasing postgraduate places available. Discussions with the heads of the schools of psychology are ongoing with a view to increasing the numbers from October 2000.</P>
    <P>In the nursing area, the difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the level of applicants for nursing posts outside the Dublin area far exceeds the number of positions available. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialities over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it.</P>
    <P>New arrangements have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad. A significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units has been introduced. Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions. Some 11 hospitals around the country provided 'back to nursing' courses in 1999 for nurses wishing to return to the workforce. A total of 304 places were available. The expansion of these courses is aimed at maximising the available nursing workforce. During 1999-2000, 16 new post-registration programmes have been developed. This year there will be 660 places on post-registration courses in specialised areas of clinical practice. In response to an identified need, 11 of the 16 new programmes will be located outside the Dublin area. An anti-bullying policy document, prepared by the HSEA and agreed with the nursing unions, was published in December 1999 and has been widely promoted within the service. The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being <Col N="1479" /> significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the commission on nursing.</P>
    <P>Up to 1,250 clinical nurse-midwife specialist positions are being introduced for nurses who have recognised expertise in particular areas. These posts attract the clinical nurse manager 2 salary. Nurses are also benefiting from an agreement to upgrade 1,100 staff nurse posts to clinical nurse manager 1 grade which is being implemented at present.</P>
    <P>A study of the nursing and midwifery resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. Following on from this, a national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the Health research Board and awarded to the Department of nursing studies, University College Cork.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicate that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here. Employers have stepped-up their recruitment from abroad with significant success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, for example, in addition to ongoing recruitment within Ireland. Swift progress is being made on the implementation of the agenda for change mapped out by the commission on nursing. A priority action plan was agreed with the nursing alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. Additional funding of £10 million has been provided this year for initiatives in the action plan.</P>
    <P>The commission on nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to <Col N="1480" /> address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the commission on nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the nursing alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. These issues are being addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. From 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in the public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005.</P>
    <P>Further funding totalling £400,000 was made available to the various schools of nursing throughout the country late last year to enable them undertake local marketing campaigns aimed at promoting nursing as a career. This year there were more than three applicants for every available training place. This is most encouraging bearing in mind that the total number of training places is being increased by 25% over last year to 1,500 and the reduction in the volume of applicants for public service positions generally. The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, has been increased to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify. In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms have also been increased.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to improve the situation. In the longer-term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies. The numbers employed in the public health service at 31 December 1998, are set out in the following table, wholetime equivalents. This is the latest date for which census data is available.</P>

      <P>On 18 April the Government authorised the drafting of the Ombudsman for Children Bill, 2000, on the lines of the general scheme attached to a memorandum which I submitted to Government. The process of drafting the Bill has now commenced with the assignment of a parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>The scope of the proposed functions is very comprehensive. This is because of the very broad range of Departments, agencies and other bodies whose responsibilities, services and actions impact on the lives of children. The office of Ombudsman for Children will provide an important additional protection for children.</P>
      <P>The legislation will ensure that the Ombudsman for Children will be an independent office, and will be appointed by the President in a similar way to the existing Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal functions of the Ombudsman for Children to which the legislation will give effect are as follows: (i) the promotion of the welfare and rights of children and to act as a catalyst for change; (ii) responding to individual complaints in relation to public, private and voluntary bodies; (iii) the establishment of mechanisms through which there will be regular consultation with chil<Col N="1482" /> dren; and (iv) an advisory role to the Government.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the office will be established in 2000.</P>

      <P>The study to which the Deputy refers is entitled &ldquo;Women's Healthcare Services in General Practice&rdquo; and was published by the Irish College of General Practitioners. Its aim was to generate information which would direct the development and strengthening of women's reproductive health care services provision in general practice. I welcome the publication of this detailed report, which provides useful information and insights into the family planning and other reproductive health services provided by general practitioners.</P>
      <P>The study shows that almost all GPs provide hormonal contraception and that over 90% provide sterilisation counselling and emergency contraception. Certain other types of family planning service were found to be less frequently available in general practice, with a range of reasons, foremost of which were doctors' lack of skill and the lack of demand among patients, being cited in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. In this regard, additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards. Boards have been asked, when developing policy, to concentrate on measures aimed at reducing unwanted pregnancies in the 15-34 age-group. These include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their needs in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational or promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity.</P>
      <P>General practice has a major role to play in the delivery of family planning services and the health boards will continue to work with general practitioners and other service providers to develop the range of services available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group, at assistant secretary level, is preparing a national children's strategy, with the assistance of a cross-departmental team. The strategy will broadly reflect the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, will be child-centred and holistic in approach and will aim to improve the quality of children's lives, adopting a ten year timeframe for detailed planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. It will set out a range of proposals to advance the welfare and status of children in society; address the need to develop our research and information base; recommend more effective ways of obtaining the views of children and set out proposals on how to improve co-ordination and planning in the provision of services for children.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group is representative of the following Departments: Health and Children; Education and Science; Social, Community and Family Affairs; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Environment and Local Government; Tourism, Sport and Recreation; Finance; the Taoiseach and the Attorney General's office. Each of these Departments has an input into the development of the strategy. In addition, the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have contributed to the development of the strategy. The cross-departmental team which is assisting the interdepartmental group in the preparation of the strategy has members from the Departments of Health and Children; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The consultation process, including consultation with children, will be completed at the end of June with the holding of a national forum to publicise the results of the consultation. Based on current projections, I expect that the interdepartmental group will have finished its work by next September. On completion the strategy will be submitted to Government for approval to publish.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council has not decided to ban doctors from outside the European Union from working in Irish hospitals. It decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland. Overseas doctors, EU and non-EU, account for about one-third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to junior doctors. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure all posts are filled. If some posts are unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that, as far as possible, services will not be affected.</P>

      <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid for a number of weeks to come as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure essential and critical services are not affected. I am confident that with full co-operation from all concerned, and a degree of imagination in making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>

      <P>The philosophy underlying the medical card scheme, as enshrined in the relevant legislation, is concerned with providing a high quality health care service for those unable, without undue hardship, to provide a service for themselves or their dependants. The commitment to this principle of equity which ensures availability of medical treatment is based on need rather than ability to pay is consistent with the most effective and efficient use of public resources. Moreover decisions on eligibility in every individual case are made, under law, by the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, who in determining eligibility may have regard not only to annual income guidelines but any other factor that he or she considers relevant to circumstances of the particular individual in question. Accordingly I am satisfied that the present eligibility structure of the medical card scheme is fair and proper and I have no plans to make any changes in this area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a national review of bed capacity in acute and non-acute settings. As part of this review the Eastern Regional Health Authority has commissioned a study to assess existing bed capacity within the eastern region and to project future needs. The objective of the study is to determine future requirements based on: good standards of efficiency and performance; population characteristics; medical and health care developments.</P>
      <P>The study will analyse the bed use within the region for the past five years and identify the key factors influencing activity. The study will also examine international comparisons and review the efficiency and performance of current bed capacity. The study will forecast the number of beds and any changes needed in this regard in Eastern Regional Health Authority hospitals. I expect to receive the report in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance scheme is administered by health boards on my behalf. The allowance is paid in respect of eligible children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced on budget day last year that additional funding would be made available from 1 January 2000 to support the application of the <Col N="1487" /> domiciliary care allowance scheme, introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973, to eligible children under two years of age. This modification to the scheme was confined to the age eligibility criterion only. Other criteria, as outlined in Circular No. 24/73, have not been altered. The circular points out,<i> inter alia,</i> that:</P>
    <P>The fact that a severe handicap is present does not automatically justify the payment of an allowance. . . It is not intended that the Scheme should apply to short-term illnesses or disabilities &ndash; the handicap must be present at the time of application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date, and be likely to continue to last for at least a year. It is not visualised that any particular condition should be debarred from consideration &ndash; each case can be considered on its merits. . .</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the demanding role facing parents and guardians of children of all ages with a disability. Officials of my Department are in consultation with the health board chief executive officers and their senior area medical officers about the issues raised by the Deputies. The process has not yet reached a conclusion.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry is the body responsible for monitoring the incidence of cancer in the State. The registry collects, classifies, records, stores and analyses information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and related tumours. There is no definite link between the fall-out from Chernoybl and the incidence of cancer.</P>
      <P>Since the accident in 1986 at Chernobyl the environmental effects of the fall-out are being monitored on an ongoing basis. The fall-out from the accident was greatest in upland peaty areas of the country and coniferous forests. Sediment and fish from lakes in these areas and live sheep and sheepmeat are monitored on an ongoing basis. Contamination of game fish from lakes continues to be of negligible significance. The limited consumption of such fish means that the doses incurred by the public are not such as to cause any significant health risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monitoring of sheep at slaughterhouses and random samples of sheepmeat from butchers' shops indicate that regular consumption of sheepmeat does not constitute a significant health hazard. The data collected suggest that the potential for significant individual dose transfer is largely limited to groups such as hunters and regular con<Col N="1488" /> sumers of wild produce. Airborne dust, rainwater, drinking water and milk samples measured as part of normal environmental monitoring for radioactivity showed no abnormal levels.</P>

      <P>Cancer specialists and researchers believe that a combination of factors play an important role in the development of cancer. Genetics, viral infections, environmental factors as well as one's lifestyle behaviours, all play key roles in the development of cancerous growths. It is estimated that tobacco, alcohol and diet, the three major lifestyle risk factors, contribute to two thirds of all cancers in Europe. Other factors such as exposure to cancer causing substances, untraviolet rays and radiation also carry a risk of cancer.</P>

    <P>These figures have been adjusted for changes in the population from 1994 to 1997. As all skin cancers may not have been picked up in the early years of the registry, the figures for all cancers, excluding skin cancer, are a more reliable indication of the rate of increase, which is about 0.3% per year. This increase is too small to be distinguished statistically from a zero rate of change.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer in recent years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996 and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area. The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are: to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that <Col N="1490" /> those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with two co-regional directors of cancer services appointed in the North Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their areas and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. On a national basis, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services in Letterkenny general hospital is the statutory responsibility of the North Western Health Board in the first instance. However I understand from the board that an epidural service is currently available at Letterkenny general hospital on a Monday to Friday basis between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily. The service depends on the availability of consultant anaesthetist staff. When the epidural service was introduced last year, two additional registrars were employed to take the complement of registrar staff up to four. This was to ensure that consultant anaesthetist staff could be released at short notice to provide this service. However from January 2000 the hospital has only been able to secure the services of one registrar <Col N="1492" /> out of a total complement of four. This has impacted on the availability of the epidural service. The board has informed me that from 1 July next it is hoped that the appointment of four registrars will ensure that the service will resume on a normal 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily basis.</P>

This includes provision for a visit to a general practitioner two weeks and six weeks after the birth of the baby. In addition, the report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group, which was circulated in 1997, recommended that the director of community care-medical officer should be notified immediately of all births in hospitals and ensure that the public health nurse visits the mother and baby within 24 hours of discharge from hospital.</P>
      <P>The maternity and infant care scheme was revised in December 1999, and all health boards were asked to ensure all the report's recommendations are implemented. A total of £970,000 was allocated for the year 2000 in order that this revision of the scheme could be carried out. Adequate resources are available to enable the health boards to fulfil their obligation to mothers and infants as laid out in the maternity and infant care scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The targets set for breastfeeding rates are those outlined in the national breastfeeding policy. While I accept that the breastfeeding rates in Ireland appear to be low in comparison to our European counterparts, the health promotion unit of my Department is committed to continuing its support for the implementation of the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. A number of factors influence the success or otherwise of implementing the policy. <Col N="1493" /> However in prioritising the recommendations and how they might be implemented it was recognised that the support of health professionals would be critical to its successful implementation as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure the mother receives information on the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice. Consequently the National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. This pack was developed in conjunction with An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding. This training pack is now in place and available to the relevant health professional bodies.</P>
      <P>Another key recommendation of the national breastfeeding policy was that Ireland participate in the baby friendly hospital initiative. This global campaign, led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF, encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed. The initiative has been established in Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved continues to grow.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit also continues to be involved in ensuring that the other recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy are implemented. Other initiatives undertaken to achieve this include the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding and supporting voluntary organisations such as La Leche League, Cuidiú, Irish Childbirth Trust, and the Association of Lactation Consultants, to further promote the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the continuing implementation of the recommendations and particularly the growing participation in the baby friendly hospital initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>

      <P>The review found that since the introduction of the dental treatment service scheme in 1994 a large section of the population for whom little or no treatment was available in the past had relatively easy access to dental care. In general the scheme was providing an equitable, quality service for medical card holders in compliance with the Department's health strategy. The review recommended that a number of structures and <Col N="1494" /> processes designed to improve accountability and therefore better performance and outcomes needed to be put in place.</P>
      <P>With the agreement of the Irish Dental Association revised procedures designed to improve access, probity and accountability under the scheme are being implemented. I have since extended treatment under the scheme to all adults with medical card entitlements. I have made additional funding available to all health boards in their ongoing allocations to fund this extension of services to persons aged 35 to 64 years.</P>
      <P>The review also recommended the appointment of additional staff at the GMS (Payments) Board with dedicated roles ensuring probity in the operation of the scheme. These recommendations will be discussed by my Department with the board.</P>
      <P>The review recommends that a process should begin to bring together the administration of the dental treatment services scheme and the dental treatment benefit scheme. Some initial discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in this regard.</P>

      <P>A number of studies claim to have produced results along the lines referred to in the Deputy's question. The same results are found among other professions whose members work in highly responsible or stressful conditions. The health service has to be concerned about the health of its own employees if it is to deliver effective services to the general population. The Health Service Employers Agency is examining the introduction of an occupational health service in health agencies. Most major hospitals already have such a service but an effort needs to be made to ensure that all health service employees have access to a properly structured and resourced service.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. Details of facilities notified and inspections carried out based on the most up to date information available from the health boards are as follows:</P>

    <P>Notifications to the health boards are ongoing as new facilities come on stream. Inspections are ongoing also. The number of inspections carried out as shown above include first and second annual inspections.</P>
    <P>Where deficiencies in services are identified during inspection, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction, that is, not replacing children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The timescale for making <Col N="1496" /> improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months, exceptionally, a longer period may be allowed.</P>
    <P>Where serious breaches of the regulations concerning the health, safety and welfare of children are identified during inspection, health boards can bring the matter to the attention of the district court under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991. The Southern Health Board brought a prosecution against one provider who was obliged by the court to cease operating her service for a period of 60 days.</P>
    <P>All health boards report that they are aware that a number of pre-school service providers have closed their service voluntarily either before or after inspection. The boards report that such closures occur for a range of reasons including providers being aware that they fall short of the standards required by the regulations, providers returning to other employment or study, a change in personal circumstances or retirement of providers.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million, capital and revenue, was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 8,000 places were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided in 2000.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care provision over the next seven years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This funding will facilitate the child care measures which were announced in budget 2000. The main objective of the new measures is to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and also to improve the quality of services available. These measures comprise the equal opportunities child care programme which includes: grant supports to establish, renovate, and-or upgrade and staff community based not-for-profit childcare facilities and capital grants for self-employed private childcare providers to build, renovate or upgrade facilities catering for not more than 20 children at any one time. Applications have been invited by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for this grant scheme.</P>
    <P>Funding will also be made available by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to develop local child care networks; to support national voluntary child care organisations which provide advice and support to child care service providers; to support innovative projects in the child care area and for initiatives to support the development of local child care training.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.4 million has been made available to my Department this year to <Col N="1497" /> strengthen both the pre-school advisory and the inspection role of the health boards. This will facilitate health boards with the planned increase in the number of child care places.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was announced in budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, will apply in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, the allowances are subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>My Department has funded the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which will have responsibility for the controls on genetically modified foods and food ingredients, including the assessments and approval for any new GM foods. The FSAI is developing a monitoring and surveillance programme for GM foods on the market in Ireland. We have made additional funding available to the FSAI for its GM programme this year and I have approved the recruitment of two new posts in the FSAI for this work.</P>
      <P>The FSAI has a scientific committee for advising on food safety research issues and is presently advising the FSAI on priorities for food safety research. The Environmental Protection Agency is currently engaged in identifying and formulating a programme of research on issues related to the deliberate release of GMOs in response to the public consultation on GMOs and the environment.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, an interdepartmental group on GMOs was established in March 1999 to coordinate the overall Government position on GMOs.

      <P>The departmental circular sanctioning the application of the revised schedule of allowances, agreed as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike was issued on 30 November 1999.</P>
      <P>Certain issues regarding the implementation of location allowances in the mental handicap and mental health services were clarified subsequently by the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; following discussion and agreement with the Nursing Alliance. On 10 February 2000, the HSEA circulated relevant employers with the list of acute admission units in mental health services which attract payment of a location allowance; on 7 March 2000, the HSEA circulated relevant employers with details of the implementation arrangements agreed for payment of the location allowance in units for severe and profoundly handicapped in mental handicap services.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing regarding the criteria for payment of the location allowance in respect of secure units in mental health services.</P>
      <P>On 31 March, my Department wrote to the health boards, on my behalf, requesting that they take such steps as are necessary to ensure that all outstanding monies due to nurses are paid without further delay. The HSEA also took up the issue with employers. The latest information available to me, as of 19 May, concerning implementation in the health boards is set out below. I am not aware of any particular difficulties in the voluntary hospital sector.</P>
      <P>

      <P>The total number on in-patient hospital waiting lists as at 31 March 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, is 34,370. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 on the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu like illnesses and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I announced yesterday a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, <Col N="1500" /> extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the on-going implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way.

      <P>Price is one of the most effective barriers in preventing young people from smoking and I will ensure that prices are maintained at a high level. I have no information to date regarding the specific impact of the tax increase on cigarettes in the last budget. However, surveys are carried out from time to time by health boards and health research agencies on the incidence of smoking among young people and these will in time give an indication of the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to measures to tackle the incidence of smoking among young people by health boards high profile health promotion programmes are being planned involving each health board. The Eastern Regional Health Authority in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society recently launched a major campaign to reduce smoking among young people and particularly young girls.</P>
      <P>The report &ndash; Towards a Tobacco Free Society &ndash; which I launched earlier this year identifies smoking as a childhood addiction. The new office of tobacco control will be working closely with the health boards to improve the situation in this area and work is well under way on drafting a new comprehensive tobacco Bill.</P>
      <P>Tobacco advertising plays an important role in promotion of tobacco products to young people and I have advised the tobacco industry here that no further tobacco advertising or sponsorship, other than limited retail and trade advertising, will be allowed after 1 July this year.</P>

      <P>Autologous blood transfusion is the facility whereby a patient donates or <i>predeposits</i> blood for his or her own use prior to elective surgery. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service provides an autologous blood transfusion service on request subject to strict guidelines, fully informed consent and on the basis of referral from a hospital consultant. In addition to the IBTS, some hospitals provide their own autologous service. For example, in the Southern Health Board region this service is provided by Cork university hospital and through CUH to all other hospitals in the Southern Health Board area. The autologous service in the Southern Health Board must be requested by the surgeon in charge of the case and the procedure is carried out by appointment with the clinical haematology team at CUH.</P>
      <P>I have been given to understand that autologous predeposit is appropriate only in a minority of elective procedures and that that there is lack of unanimous agreement among clinicians about its value. Decisions regarding the utilisation of autologous procedures in individual cases are a matter for the patient's own clinician. I would advise any patient who wishes to avail of this service to discuss the matter with her-his consultant who will provide the appropriate advice.</P>

    <P>The numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 on the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu like illnesses and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for <Col N="1502" /> hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, yesterday, I announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the on-going implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>Since November 1999, all blood donations collected by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; are screened by PCR for hepatitis C. PCR testing is a further safeguard aimed at improving the detection of hepatitis C during the window period. The typical length of the window period without PCR testing is ten to 14 weeks. Following the introduction of PCR testing, this window period is reduced to on average 25 days. In order to introduce this test as rapidly as possible, the IBTS contracted with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; SNBTS &ndash; in Edinburgh to conduct the test on its behalf. The SNBTS was selected as it has an aggressive programme for the introduction of PCR testing for all donations. The transfusion service in Northern Ireland has also contracted with the SNBTS for PCR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of PCR results as a release criteria for blood components by the IBTS is being introduced in parallet with the SNBTS. At the present time, the majority of PCR test results are returned to the IBTS on the fourth day after the donation has been taken. The test format being used in Scotland requires two to three working days in the laboratory after donation. A small <Col N="1503" /> number of samples require further analysis because of difficulties associated with this test. The test results are currently faxed to the IBTS. Electronic exchange of data when the IBTS's new computer system is implemented in the summer will improve turnaround time in the transmission of results. In the case of platelets, which have a shelf life of five days, improvement in assay and turnaround times will be required before PCR test results can be used to determine release of these products.</P>
    <P>Approximately 160,000 donations are tested annually by the IBTS. Donations found positive in serological tests are discarded and not issued. No such reactive result by PCR has been observed to date. In the unlikely event that a PCR positive result is observed, that is, a window period donation, appropriate follow-up, including product recall, will be initiated. The risk of transmission of hepatitis C in the window period is currently estimated as one in 500,000 as current mandatory tests are extremely robust and sensitive. The Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, is satisfied with the current position regarding the implementation of PCR testing by the IBTS. It is not a mandatory test for blood components in Europe or in the United States.</P>
    <P>Blood components transfused in Irish hospitals meet all European standards. Over and above these standards, the IBTS plan to enable all components including platelets to be tested for PCR as a release criteria before the end of this year. This will coincide with similar arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland and will be an advance on the majority of other European transfusion centres. The IBTS plan to perform PCR testing at its new headquarters within the next twelve months when a testing system is validated and fully operational.</P>

      <P>Respite care is provided in a number of ways. In some cases it is provided in a residential setting. It is also provided by host families through the various share a break schemes. The home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers. These services enable agencies and health boards to respond to each family's needs in a flexible manner and with a package of care which is designed in consultation with the carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year additional revenue funding of £35 million, with an annual cost of £45 million, has <Col N="1504" /> been allocated towards the development of new residential, respite and day facilities for persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In relation to services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, additional capital funding of £30 million has also been made available this year, as part of an £80 million investment programme over the next three years to support these services. It is anticipated that the additional capital and revenue funding will enable a further 185 new respite places to be provided this year. This is in addition to the 80 respite places which were put in place in 1999. The Government is committed to meeting the identified needs of persons with an intellectual disability within a defined timeframe of three years starting with this major acceleration of investment this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to services to persons with physical and sensory disabilities almost 100 new respite places have been put in place over the past three years. Of the funding provided this year, £3 million, rising to £6 million in the year 2001, has been targeted at home support services.</P>
    <P>The additional funding provided this year to services to persons with disabilities brings the total revenue and capital funding provided by this Government to date to £188.7 million, with a full year cost in 2001 of £202.7 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My role in this area relates to the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991. The regulations provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre±ches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the <Col N="1505" /> welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million, capital and revenue, was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 8,000 places were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided in 2000 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care provision over the next seven years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This funding will facilitate the childcare measures which were announced in budget 2000. The main objective of the new measures is to increase the number of childcare facilities and child care places and also to improve the quality of services available.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the child care measures is being facilitated by the establishment of an interdepartmental policy committee on child care, a national co-ordinating child care committee and county child care committees. My Department is participating on the interdepartmental policy committee on child care and on the national co-ordinating child care committee. The health boards are participating on the national co-ordinating child care committee and the county child care committees will be led by the relevant health boards. These committees will liaise locally and nationally on child care.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.4 million has been made available to my Department this year to strengthen both the pre-school advisory and the inspection role of the health boards. This will facilitate health boards with the planned increase in the number of child care places.</P>

      <P>It is Department policy that, on medical grounds, the delivery of babies should take place in consultant staffed maternity units. This policy is in line with the recommendations of the Comhairle na nOspidéal report &ndash; Development of Hospital Maternity Services &ndash; which examined in detail the objectives of health care in relation to maternity services.</P>
      <P>The report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group, which was circulated in April 1997, gave a strong endorsement to Department policy on this issue. However, the report also recognised that one of the main reasons women opt to give birth at home is their desire for a positive experience in friendly, familiar surroundings where they retain full control. The health boards have agreed to contribute £650 towards the costs of a privately retained midwife. The health boards' chief executive officers established an expert group to consider a number of approaches suggested by the review group in relation to domiciliary births and to make recommendations on long-term policy and on the procedures and protocols which may be necessary. Funding was provided in 1999 for the piloting of a number of approaches suggested.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that current Department policy has contributed to the marked decrease in the level of maternal, perinatal and infant mortality. At present, Ireland's maternal mortality rates are among the best in the world, reflecting the excellent ante-natal and obstetric services available in this country. The judgment in the individual court case referred to by the Deputy has been carefully noted but the policy in this area is that while arrangements must be made for those who wish to give birth at home, the safety and welfare of both mother and infant must at all times take priority.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, is administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95 and £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. However, a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>
      <P>The amount made available for the subvention scheme this year is £38.4 million. My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands.  The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities in the development of services for older people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>Section 18(4) of the Coroners Act, 1962, <i>inter alia</i>, provides that &ldquo;every medical practitioner who has reason to believe that the deceased person died, whether directly or indirectly from any reason other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death, or in such circumstances as may require investigation, including death as the result of the administration of an anaesthetic, shall immediately notify the Coroner within whose district the body is of the fact and circumstances relating to the death&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following an inquiry from my Department on 9 March 2000, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children informed my Department that its practice in relation to deaths of patients recognises the legal duty in certain circumstances to notify the coroner. At that time the hospital undertook a review of the post mortem examination cases on which the alleged breaches of the Coroners Act, 1962, were based. The hospital has since provided my Department with a written submission on this review. The submission also outlines the hospital's understanding of the Coroner's Act, 1962, and the Birth and Death Registration Act, 1880; the hospital's policy and practice in relation to this matter; and a random review of deaths necessitating contact with the coroner.</P>
      <P>It is my opinion that these cases, and any other similar cases, would fall within the terms of reference of the inquiry which I recently announced. Consequently, I do not consider it appropriate to make any further comment on the matter at this stage. I trust the Deputy will appreciate the view that the independence of the Inquiry is of critical importance and must be respected as such.</P>
      <P>I am aware of additional trauma and distress caused to parents as a result of these matters and I am confident that the inquiry will ensure that parents will be satisfied that the full facts of all of the issues involved will be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's primary role in respect of the provision of child care and family support services is to resource the health boards to discharge their statutory responsibilities under the Act. This is in the context of the Child Care Act, 1991, which strengthens the powers of the health boards to provide child care and family support services.</P>
      <P>Resourcing decisions are made against the background of regular contacts between officials of my Department and officials of the health boards. In 2000, an additional £31.75 million was allocated towards child care and family support services, the largest single amount since the Child Care Act was passed.</P>
      <P>In addition, in January 1998, the Government established the young people at risk programme, which has at its centre the young people's facilities and services fund. My predecessor was given approval by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion to spend £2.4 million per year from that fund for a three year period on a number of pilot family support projects for children at risk. These projects have been named the springboard initiatives and to date 15 such projects have been established. The objective of springboard is to establish a pilot family support project in a number of identified communities throughout the country. These projects work intensively with children, mainly in the seven to 12 year age group, who are at risk and their families. In addition, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs funds a number of community development support programmes. The programme was established in 1990 and it now funds some 90 projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Family, in its final report, recommended that a network of 100 family and community resource centres be established over a four to five year period. By the end of 1999, 61 centres were being funded by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and it is expected that a further 15 will be established by the end of 2000. In addition, ten new core-funded community and family support groups will be established. Provision has been made in the national development plan to increase funding to these programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of co-ordination both my Department, and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be participating fully on the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on child care, with a view to ensuring that all <Col N="1511" /> funding is targeted at those areas most in need. In addition, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is represented on the interdepartmental working group which is overseeing the preparation of the national children's strategy. There is also regular contact between officials of both Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a substantial increase in the level of additional funding provided for the development of services for older people in recent years. The amount of additional revenue funding has increased from £3 million in 1997 to £7 million in 1998 and to £16 million in 1999. It is intended to continue the expansion of resources for older people and additional revenue funding has risen to £23.6 million for 2000. When increased funding for nursing home subventions is included, the programme of development measures implemented for older people will cost approximately £30 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>Significant increases in the level of capital resources have also been made available from £6.75 million in 1997, approximately £14 million in 1998, £17 million in 1999 to approximately £20 million in 2000. The national development plan will provide some £188 million capital funding to services for older people in the period 2001-06, inclusive. This is to enable significant progress in the provision of a comprehensive infrastructure of facilities for older people ranging from assessment and rehabilitation units, day hospitals, respite and day care to extended care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another. However, there is no evidence that hospitals are poaching from nursing homes. The Deputy may be aware that the major Dublin hospitals have stepped-up their recruitment from abroad with significant success. Agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for <Col N="1512" /> non-EU nurses. This procedure is of assistance to nursing homes, as well as hospitals. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicate that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. The inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken at national level or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it. In particular, the number of nurse training places is being increased by 300 to 1,500 this year, while 1999 saw the largest intake of student nurses for many years. Also, 11 hospitals around the country provided back to nursing courses in 1999 for nurses wishing to return to the workforce. A total of 304 places were available. The expansion of these courses is aimed at maximising the available nursing workforce.</P>
    <P>Nursing home proprietors are aware that considerable additional resources have been allocated to the nursing home subvention scheme in recent years. Expenditure on the scheme has increased from £4 million in 1993 when the scheme was introduced to £38.4 million in 2000. In the current year, additional funding of £5.4 million has been provided to meet the cost of the additional expenditure which is due to a number of factors. These include the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Children are placed in foster care in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Residential Care) Regulations, 1995, and the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995. Decisions regarding the placement of children are made on the basis of the best interests of the children concerned and health boards deal with each individual case on its merits.</P>
      <P>When placing children in foster care, health boards take into account the suitability of the prospective foster family and of the accommodation available. In general, the number of children placed with a foster carer is kept to a minimum. However, the number of children so placed can vary from time to time for a number of reasons, in particular, where there is a need to accommodate brothers and sisters from the same family.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the social services inspectorate in April 1999, standards of child care services are kept under review. While the inspectorate is concentrating on residential care for the first three years of its operation, it has been decided to begin the preparation of standards for foster care to allow for a more comprehensive monitoring of this important area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that a working group on foster care was established last year by the then Minister of State to examine all aspects of foster care. The working group consists of nominees from my Department, the health boards and the Irish Foster Care Association and also includes a foster parent. The group is addressing the problems currently being experienced by those involved in foster care and the aim is to develop a wide range of services for foster children and their carers. The group will report by the end of the summer and its recommendations will contribute significantly to the further development of these important services.</P>
      <P>Foster carers play a vital part in our child protection services and it is my intention to ensure that they are fully supported. Shortly after my appointment as Minister of State, I met the Irish Foster Care Association and I assured it of my commitment in this regard and I am happy to confirm this position.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed about the incidence of the antibiotic resistant superbug, MRSA, found in hospitals; if he will give the number of hospitals in which MRSA has been detected; the plans there are for better monitoring and reporting of MRSA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns relating to antibiotic resistant organisms, an important form of which is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus &ndash; MRSA. Much international research has been carried out in this area and, at a European level, Ireland is involved in surveillance of antibiotic-resistant organisms.</P>
      <P>MRSA is not a statutorily notifiable infectious disease and so statistics on its occurrence or on the number of hospitals in which it has been detected are not routinely compiled by my Department. In 1995, a survey was carried out to ascertain the number of times MRSA was isolated in acute hospitals in each health board area over a defined time period. The objective was to obtain an indication of the MRSA problem in Ireland prior to introducing national MRSA guidelines. A survey of all microbiology laboratories in Ireland was carried out over two weeks in spring 1995. MRSA was isolated from 448 patients during the two week period. The prevalence of MRSA during this period was 16.5 in every 1,000 discharges. A repeat all-Ireland study was undertaken in 1999 under the direction of the department of public health in the Eastern Health Board. The results of this study are expected to be available shortly.</P>
      <P>The importance of infection control has been recognised for some time and was specifically addressed by my Department in 1995. At that time, detailed guidelines in relation to the control of MRSA were developed and circulated by my Department. While the guidelines dealt specifically with the control of MRSA, the principles set out in the guidelines are equally applicable to control of hospital-acquired infection in general. The guidelines draw attention to such issues as the need for education and training of staff and for infection control structures and procedures. I fully endorse the approach set out in these guidelines, which emphasise the importance of implementing appropriate infection control procedures and practices with a view to ensuring that hospital-acquired infection is kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>On the initiative of EU chief medical officers, a major international conference on the issue of antibiotic resistance was held in Copenhagen in September 1998. My Department was represented by the deputy chief medical officer and service providers were represented by a range of health care professionals. Arising from recommendations made at the conference, my Department entered into discussions with appropriate agencies, including the National Disease Surveillance Centre, with a view to establishing multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral policies to reduce the threat posed by anti-microbial resistance, disseminating relevant information through the health services and monitoring any further developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> Therefore, in addition to the guidelines already published, at my Department's request, the National Disease Surveillance Centre has convened an expert group to advise on appropriate policies in relation to anti-microbial resistance. Among the range of issues on which the NDSC has been asked to consider is the development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community settings. The NDSC is currently preparing a report on these issues and the problem of anti-microbial resistance generally.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; is a matter for its board of management. In April 2000 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children published its report on single site testing of blood products which I have studied in detail. The Joint Committee considered that the import of the presentations made to it might be that the security, backup and synergy provided through enhancing the current two site testing arrangements seem significantly superior to relying on a new and as yet unproven centre for all the country's blood testing facilities. The report also refers to the need to ensure optimal patient care in accordance with international practice and to optimise resources to the maximum possible degree. It also refers to the risk of contamination of centralised laboratories and of closure due to industrial problems.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board's preliminary consideration of the report took place at its meeting on 10 May 2000 and detailed consideration of the report is now taking place. I expect to meet the board as soon as it completes its consideration of the report. I also understand that the Joint Committee is meeting with representatives of the board tomorrow concerning the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee's report also refers to contention between two of the IBTS centres. I have also been informed by the board that its objective is to develop a national cohesive organisation which meets the needs of the hospital services effectively and efficiently. This objective is based on the need to address weaknesses identified in a number of reports including the report of the expert group on the BTSB, the Bain report and the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the BTSB &ndash; the Finlay report. Staff of the IBTS are located at three centres at present, namely Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Additional staff will be located at two new mobile blood collection <Col N="1516" /> centres which are being established in Carlow and Ardee, County Louth. The board has recently reviewed progress to-date in achieving this key objective and considers that further action is now required given the establishment of two additional mobile centres.</P>
    <P>The board fully recognises the importance of the participation of staff in the ongoing development of the organisation and in improving services to hospitals throughout the country. A consultative process has commenced which is being managed on a collaborative basis involving staff on a functional, such as medical, technical, nursing and donor services, rather than on a traditional geographic basis. The board considers that all staff should fully engage in this process in the interests of the organisation as a whole. The board is also developing a revised committee-team structure which will ensure appropriate and ongoing involvement of staff in the planning and implementation of board policy. The board will review the implementation of this initiative on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I remain concerned about the ongoing tension within the IBTS. I have raised this matter with the board and there is a strong obligation on all concerned to resolve outstanding issues that have given rise to this tension.</P>

      <P>The national alcohol policy was launched by my Department in September 1996. It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. As alcohol problems are multidimensional, the policy sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place. The national alcohol surveillance centre has been established; a national lifestyle survey has been carried out and an advertising campaign emphasising the message of moderation in drinking has been carried out and evaluated and a new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers is in the planning stage. Research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people.</P>

      <P>Board appointments will be considered in due course in the light of the objectives of the foundation, that is, to invest in a cadre of world class research personnel with a view to underpinning future national development. As regards the participation of medical research charities in the new foundation, I understand that Forfás is consulting widely with all interested parties, including medical research bodies, in relation to a first call for proposals. I should point out that the proposals selected for support by the foundation will be those that are successful in a competitive call based on a process of international peer review.</P>

      <P>The statutory control of prices ceased in the 1980s. Since then, the policy of successive Governments has been to promote greater competition and consumer awareness. While prices are not now controlled by regulation but are determined by competition in the marketplace, competition requires fair rules &ndash; which are set out in the Competition Acts &ndash; and price transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Price transparency is essential if consumers are to be in a position to make informed decisions <Col N="1521" /> about purchases. On the specific question of the price of beverages on sale in licensed premises, I took action last year to bring greater transparency to the drinks trade: I made the retail price (beverages in licensed premises) display order, which requires the display of certain prices immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to a premises. As a result of this order, consumers are now provided with fair warning of the prices being charged before they enter a premises so that they can take their custom elsewhere if they believe those prices to be unreasonably high.</P>
    <P>The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has the power to prosecute for non-compliance with the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a major independent review of the States' 16 commercial regional ports, including Baltimore harbour, was published last year. The review develops a general strategic framework for the ports and harbours concerned which aims to maximise their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socio-economic impacts.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the review, a full consultative process was initiated to give all stakeholders and interests a chance to comment on the recommendations of the review in advance of any decisions being made.</P>
      <P>In Baltimore's case, the independent consultancy review recommends that the harbour be transferred to Cork County Council. Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners have indicated that they believe the best way forward is for the County Council to take over the running of the harbour. The development requirements of Baltimore harbour can only be considered in the context of such a transfer, competing demands for funding from the other regional ports which were the subject of the review, the overall priorities for coastal infrastructure development, and in light of funding available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Baltimore Harbour Commissioners had submitted a comprehensive development plan (costed at some £8 million) prior to publication of the review. I point out, however, that while Baltimore harbour continues to operate under the Harbours Act, 1946, it is <Col N="1522" /> defunct in terms of commercial traffic and has very little income with revenue returns, mainly from recreational users, failing to top £10,000 in the past four years.</P>
    <P>I have received no specific application from Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners for funding of the car park adjoining the pier at Baltimore and have no information as to whether this constitutes a part or a stage of the overall development plan. Any provision of funding from the Vote of my Department towards such a development would have to be channelled through the harbour commissioners on foot of a detailed and costed project proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with the RPII, I have encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas and who have not had their homes <Col N="1523" /> measured for radon levels to contact the RPII with a view to having the radon levels in their homes assessed.</P>

The herdowner was supplied with form TC2 (application for tax clearance certificate) by the local district veterinary office (DVO) on 19th April 1999. To date the necessary certificate has not been received. I have asked the local DVO to forward him with another copy of form TC2.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing scheme of early retirement from farming addresses two main structural defects in <Col N="1527" /> Irish agriculture, namely the age profile of farmers and the size of farm holdings.</P>
    <P>In relation to the latter, transfer or holdings can be split between two or more transferees, where each transferee already holds land in his/her own right, thereby increasing the overall acreage already held by each transferee. If the transferee does not previously hold land in his/her own right before receiving land from the transferor, the splitting of holdings is not allowed in such cases. The splitting of holdings which is permissible under the scheme rules, is not contrary to the principle underpinning the early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>The splitting of holdings is not referred to specifically in the EU regulation governing the scheme of early retirement from farming but rules dealing with the matter governing it are set out in detail in the scheme document and scheme guidelines. I will make arrangements to forward copies of these documents to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new early retirement scheme, submitted by my Department to the European Commission as part of the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, do not include the enlargement requirement. A viability requirement will apply instead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that since the CAP reform arrangements were introduced in 1992 restrictions are in place in a number of EU funded schemes which limit the size of the claim or restricts eligibility to certain categories of producer. These limits and restrictions arise from policy decisions within the framework of the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>Effectively my Department must satisfy itself that where new holdings are created after 30 June 1992 they are in fact legitimate entities managed separately from existing holdings and that holdings which existed prior to 30 June 1992 are not split into two or more holdings with the sole purpose of avoiding individual limits on eligibility for premiums. Applying this requirement to the Teagasc and Department farms it can be seen that there was no conversion of existing holdings or creation of new holdings after 30 June 1992 which led to improper avoidance of the provision relating to individual limits on eligibility for premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as overpayments generally are concerned, it is the policy of my Department to recover any overpayments at the earliest oppor<Col N="1528" /> tunity, regardless of how the overpayment arose or the producer involved.</P>

      <P>Three of the animals applied on were rejected as being ineligible for the scheme.

This decision has been appealed and the outcome of the appeal will issue shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the suckler cow quota, the person named held a quota of 39 rights in 1999 and applied for suckler cow premium on 34 animals. He has been paid premium in full on that number. As he only applied on 34 cows under the 1999 scheme he did not use 90% of his suckler quota and, in accordance with the regulations, was liable to lose the five unused quota rights. He was informed of this position in January 2000 by my Department. He was also given the right to appeal this decision but did not take up this option. There is no record in my Department of advising the person named not to apply for premia.</P>

      <P>Processing of the application was completed on 4 May but a further issue was then identified during an administrative check. The person named applied for the early retirement scheme on 31 August 1999 under a joint management arrangement with her husband. It is a condition of the scheme that participants must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old-age pension. This condition also applies to participants' partners in a joint management application. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this condition when they join and they are required to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old-age pension.</P>
      <P>The applicant's husband reached the age of 66 on 9 February 1989 and was entitled to apply for an old age pension but my Department was not told whether he had done so or been awarded one. If he has been awarded the old age pension, it will have to be offset against payments under the early retirement scheme. Before these payments can commence, my Department is obliged to confirm the position with regard to his old age pension, and the applicant has now been written to asking for the necessary information.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 that the disabled person meets the specified medical criteria, and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect, issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local Health Authority. Where the issue of a certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal the refusal to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. It should be noted that neither the Revenue Commissioners nor my Department has any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that in this case the certificate was initially refused by the senior area medical officer and that this refusal was appealed to the board of appeal. The person concerned was examined by the board on 24 January 1998. It was found that the person did not meet the medical <Col N="1531" /> criteria at that time and accordingly, the refusal of the certificate was upheld. It is open to the person concerned to reapply for a certificate if there has been a material change in his-her medical condition to the extent that the medical criteria may now be met. It is regretted that the Revenue Commissioners cannot consider an application for relief under the scheme without the issue of a primary medical certificate.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group under the chair of an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria. I await receipt of its report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the most recently published inflation figures are higher than expected when the terms of the programme for prosperity and fairness, PPF, were being negotiated.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this increase has been due to a number of factors, which include: the sharp increase in oil prices, the fall in the value of the euro, the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco and an increase in underlying domestic inflation. Thus a large part of the recent increase in inflation reflects exceptional factors.  These factors will become less significant over time and, as a consequence, it is expected that inflation will fall in the second half of this year.  The extent of this fall will depend on the value of the euro and future oil price developments.</P>
      <P>However, this agreement is for three years and I am confident that over the remaining part of the agreement inflation will fall well below current levels. In this context I think that the appropriate policy response is to fully implement the terms of the PPF and I am confident that the agreed pay increases combined with promised tax reductions will provide for continued gains in real disposable incomes.</P>
      <P>It is this Government's view that unsustainable wage and price developments would threaten our economic prosperity.  Our objective is to ensure that the increase in inflation does not become entrenched and that concerns about overheating are addressed.  This means that the terms of the PPF must be strictly adhered to.  This is the best way of sustaining the economic and social progress that we have achieved.</P>

      <P>It is intended that savings certificates with An Post will, in principle, be included in the scheme for the transfer of dormant accounts to the care of the State. However, given the long-term nature of investment in these instruments, it is likely that only a small proportion of the amounts in savings certificates is likely to be found to be dormant, as it is envisaged that the dormancy period would only begin to reckon after the end of the initial investment period.</P>
      <P>An Post, like the other financial institutions, will be obliged to use its best endeavours to contact the owners of certificates, which have had no customer initiated activity for a specified period, and notify them that their certificates are being considered for possible dormancy status. This, of course, would only happen at the end of the specified dormancy period. It would then be the certificate-holder's responsibility to initiate some form of transaction or acknowledgement of the existence of the certificates within six months to ensure that the funds associated with the certificates were not transferred to the proposed dormant accounts fund at the NTMA.</P>

      <P>In 2000, the Programme for prosperity and fairness entails estimated additional current expenditure of £163 million which includes £121 million in additional pay costs. The cumulative additional pay costs in each of the years 2001 and 2002 will be £590 million and £970 million respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the additional pay costs, during the course of the programme the Government will introduce progressively social inclusion measures <Col N="1533" /> with a total gross cost in the year 2003 of £1.5 billion. This £1.5 billion includes the cost of indexing social welfare payments in line with the CPI. However, these indexation costs are included already in the underlying no policy change projections for 2001 &ndash; 2002 given in Table 1 of the 2000 Budget Statistics and Tables. The additional gross social inclusion expenditure above no-policy-change levels is estimated at £1.2 billion approximately. In addition to the gross additional social inclusion expenditure as indicated, the terms of the programme involve other expenditure commitments over the period 2001-2003. These additional costs are difficult to quantify but best estimates suggest they may be of the order of £400 million on a full year basis by 2003.</P>
    <P>The programme also provides that tax reductions over the period of the programme, up to and including budget 2003, when taken together with pay increases, will provide for increases in net take home pay of up to 25% or more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan 2000-2006 provides the overall framework for Irelands economic and social development over the medium term. It sets out development strategy supported by a multi-annual investment commitment. The national expenditure in the NDP was drawn up in constant 1999 prices. The Deputy will be aware that the operational programmes arising from the NDP will provide more detailed information on Exchequer spending in current prices for each year 2000 to 2006, based on 2000 estimate price assumptions. These operational programmes are the subject of negotiations with the European Commission in relation to the EU co-financed aspects and will be made publicly available in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will understand that the NDP is a <Col N="1534" /> framework document. As it is being implemented, the Government may wish to monitor and revise priorities in line with economic and social circumstances.</P>
    <P>Table 1 of the budget 2000 statistics and tables sets out the post-budget 2000 voted capital estimate for 2000 together with corresponding no-policy-change projections for 2001 and 2002. These are in current prices.</P>
    <P>The 2000 voted capital estimates have since been updated in the 2000 revised estimates for Public Services. The 2000 gross voted capital allocation, as published in the revised estimates, is £3,257 million. Of the order of 80% of the 2000 voted capital allocation is plan-related expenditure the remaining 20% comprising spending on areas such as prisons building and spending by Office of Public Works would not come under the plan. Taking into account the impact of price inflation, the 2000 revised estimates comfortably provide for the Exchequer capital requirements outlined in the NDP for 2000.</P>
    <P>The projections for 2001 and 2002 are being updated and extended to 2003, as part of the multi-annual budgetary process. In determining the multi-annual capital investment requirements of Departments, full account will be taken of the funding requirements of both the national development plan and Departments' other capital requirements over the period.</P>
    <P>The expenditure assumptions underlying the stability programme are fully consistent with the voted capital projections as published on budget day and the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to ensure that the Exchequer expenditure requirements of the NDP are fully provided for in settling voted capital projections for the period 2001-2003.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give a breakdown of the assumptions and projections for appropriations-in-aid as set out in Table 1 of Budget 2000 Statistics and Tables; if he will specify any assumptions or projections concerning the PRSI element of these appropriations-in-aid; and the implications of these projections for future flows into and out of the Social Welfare Fund.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr McCreevy Mr McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A breakdown by ministerial vote group of the current and capital appropriations-in-aid figures as given in Table 1 of the budget 2000 statistics and tables booklet is given in the following tables.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs accounts for the largest part of the total current appropriations-in-aid. This is due to the fact that the appropriations-in-aid figures for that Department include receipts in respect of PRSI contributions. This is dealt with in more detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children accounts for the next largest part of the total current appropriations-in-aid. The main element, approximately two thirds of that Department's <Col N="1535" /> appropriations-in-aid is receipts from health contributions. These take account of the full-year impact of the increase in the rate from 1.25% to 2% introduced in budget 1999 in the context of the elimination of the 1% employment and training levy. They also take account of the increase in the income threshold for the health levy announced in budget 2000. The other main elements in the Health appropriations-in-aid figures are payments from the UK authorities as recoupment in respect of Irish emigrants to the UK who have returned home and who had built-up health and welfare entitlements while working in the UK and estimated receipts, £132 million in 2000, in respect of the increase in the excise duty on tobacco announced in budget 2000 which will be paid by the Revenue Commissioners directly to the Department of Health and Children to help fund the increasing cost of health services provision.</P>
    <P>After Health and Children, the Departments with the next largest share of current appropriations-in-aid are Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Education and Science. The main elements of both of those Departments current appropriations-in-aid are accounted for by receipts from the EU in respect of programme expenditure co-funded respectively from the FEOGA, Guarantee, Fund and the European Social Fund. The projected EU receipts for both of these Departments take account of the provisions of the national development plan relevant to their areas.</P>
    <P>The appropriations-in-aid for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment include estimated receipts in respect of the new national training levy announced in budget 2000. The receipts from the levy, £120 million in a full year, will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1536" /> and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and will be paid to the National Training Fund under the control of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The receipts from the levy are paid by way of appropriations-in-aid to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The rest of the current appropriations-in-aid are spread across the other Government Departments and offices and cover a wide variety of sources. Most commonly appropriations-in-aid arise in respect of fees or charges raised for the provision of certain services, for example, TV licence fees and charges at national parks and national monuments under the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands Vote, revenue from sale of maps and royalty fees at the Ordnance Survey, etc. Full details of all appropriations-in-aid are provided in the 2000 revised estimates volume which was published on 22 March 2000.</P>
    <P>The majority of the capital appropriations-in-aid relate to EU receipts, mainly under the Departments of the Marine and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-aid for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. As outlined the largest portion of the figure for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs arises from receipts of PRSI contributions. For the years in question, it is estimated that PRSI income will be in excess of that needed to meet expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund. Since 1997 the Social Insurance Fund has been self financing and additional income is added to the ongoing surplus on the fund. At budget time, the cumulative Social Insurance Fund surplus at end 2000 was estimated at £400 million; developments in the meantime, particularly ongoing PRSI buoyancy, indicate that the cumulative surplus at the end of this year will be £600 million.</P>

However, the retail price of alcohol as measured by the CPI has increased above headline inflation since 1998 and the year-on-year increase in the retail price of alcohol has increased from 3.8% in December 1999 to 5.2% by April of this year.</P>

I have been informed that the final report of this survey will be available shortly and when it becomes available, I will have it considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>Regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been established in each health board and bring together the statutory and voluntary sector services providers, the consumers and their representatives for the better planning and co-ordination of services at regional level. From 1997 to December 1999 an additional 73 posts have been created, including an additional 17.8 physiotherapy posts, and an additional 95 respite places have also been created to provide services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including people with acquired brain injuries. Each of the health boards is in the process of establishing multidisciplinary assessment and treatment centres which will play an important role in the initial assessment of children and adults with hereditary or acquired disability.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to the development of community based services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including services to adults and children with acquired brain injury. Since coming into office, additional funding of just over £67 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of community based health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. In line with the recommendations of the review group report, Towards an Independent Future, priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.</P>

      <P>The report of the Food Safety Authority, Recommendations for a National Food and Nutritional Policy for Older People, was launched recently by the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children. I am sure the Deputy will agree that across the population spectrum, ensuring an optimal nutritional status by meeting nutritional needs is essential for healthy ageing. For older people as for the general population, <Col N="1542" /> the maintenance of good health depends on the availability of safe, affordable and appropriate foods. Eating a wide variety of foods and including foods with a high nutrient density is especially important to the older person.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has in association with the National Council on Ageing and Older People, published a health promotion strategy for older people. Nutrition is identified in this strategy as a priority area to be addressed and the overall goal is to ensure that older people have an affordable diet which provides adequate nutrition and which optimises their health status. She will also be aware that the national healthy eating campaign commenced with National Healthy Eating Week, 7-13 May. The theme for the campaign this year is &ldquo;Help your Heart &ndash; Go for low fat Healthy Eating&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report, Recommendations for a National Food and Nutritional Policy for Older People, will greatly assist not only my Department but also many other bodies in the statutory and non statutory sector who have a role to play in promoting nutrition and protecting health among older people.</P>

      <P>The Office for National Statistics, London, has indicated to my Department that statistics on the number of abortions carried out in the final quarter of 1999 will not be available until the end of May 2000. Provisional figures for the period from 1 January to 30 September 1999 indicate that 4,621 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in that period. This figure is equivalent to 11.3% of the provisional number, 40,813, of births in Ireland in the same period. The comparable figures for the same period in the previous two years are 4,006 in 1997 and 4,473 in 1998, equivalent to 9.8% and 10.9% respectively of births in the nine month period concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Green Paper on Abortion was published in September 1999, the Government indicated that it had decided to prepare a programme of measures which it is hoped will address many of the issues which have been identified as contributing to the number of Irish women who have abortions in Britain each year. Additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and a further £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards <Col N="1543" /> for the continued development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services, including measures aimed at addressing the issue of unwanted pregnancy. Health boards are undertaking a range of initiatives in this area. The type of issues on which boards are being asked to concentrate when developing policy include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their need in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational-promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity.</P>
    <P>Where pregnancy counselling services are supported, boards have been asked to ensure that these are available on a drop-in basis, without any waiting period, and that a choice of service provider is available. Steps to increase women's awareness of post-abortion counselling and of the need for medical check-ups are also being considered. Such check-ups also provide an opportunity for women to obtain advice on appropriate contraception for the future and thereby reduce the incidence of further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures which are being developed by health boards, my Department is at present planning a public awareness campaign which will aim to encourage sexually active young people to be responsible in their attitudes to relationships and to inform and educate them about the issues involved.</P>

      <P>There has been no significant development, to-date, of primary care cover in the private health insurance market. Private health insurance, as it has evolved, provides cover primarily for hospital services. Consequently, the majority of the population meet the cost of primary care on an 'out-of-pocket' basis. My Department is aware that, as a result of demand from corporate and individual customers, VHI is working on the development of an insurance plan to cover members' primary care expenses. However, the VHI board has not, to date, submitted details of the plan envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has stated in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance that the further evolution of private health insurance should include steps to promote the position of primary care in the system. The proposals outlined in the White <Col N="1544" /> Paper regarding changes to the private health insurance framework will not impact upon the existing eligibility arrangements in place for health services which ensure that persons have access to primary care services on the basis of need. Under these arrangements persons who do not qualify for a medical card under income guidelines drawn up annually by the health board chief executive officers may be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the persons medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>I consider that the White Paper proposals will facilitate choice for insured members of the public to finance their primary care needs on an insurance basis, instead of by means of direct payment alone.</P>

      <P>In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day care and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plans, temporary bed and theatre closures generally form a part of the normal management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that yesterday I announced a major £10 million initiative on public hospital waiting lists. In drawing up proposals for this additional waiting list work, the chief executive officers were asked to examine various measures, including utilising facilities during the traditional closure periods in order to maximise overall capacity in the system. The proposals received by agencies following this examination of options by the chief executive officers are to be funded in full.</P>

      <P>Irish adoption law does not specify an upper age limit for adoptive parents. However, age is a significant factor when assessing suitability to adopt. Work is ongoing on the drafting of legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and I expect that heads of a Bill will be ready to be submitted to Government this summer. In the context of this legislation, eligibility criteria of applicants to adopt, including age will be considered. When making decisions in this matter I will take into account the views expressed by the Adoption Board, the various stakeholders during the consultative process on the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention and the recommendation contained in the Report Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures. I wish to confirm that this matter is still under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Adoption Board decided to introduce upper age limits for couples proposing to adopt from aboard in December of last year. This decision has been the subject of judicial review proceedings before the High Court. Following the advice of counsel, the board has decided to withdraw these age limits with immediate effect. The Adoption Board advised health boards and adoption societies of this decision on 10 April requesting that they take immediate steps to ensure that all persons who applied for an assessment for inter-country adoption and who were refused on the grounds of age are advised in writing of the board's decision at the earliest possible stage. The board has also stated that applicants who were turned down on age grounds should be included on the agency's inter-country adoption waiting list as and from the date of their original application.</P>

      <P>All hospitals that take student nurses for all or part of their pre-registration training are approved by An Bord Altranais, the nursing board, to provide the six-week orientation and assessment period for nurses from overseas wishing to register in Ireland. This six-week period is flexible, in that it may be reduced if, in the opinion of experienced clinical nurses accustomed to assessing students, the full six weeks is unnecessary. Nurses who have trained in certain specified countries, where the training equates very closely with that provided here and where English is their first language, are exempted from this requirement as are nurses from the EU.</P>
      <P>To date, overseas nurses recruited for the nursing home sector and one private hospital have been facilitated by one teaching hospital, and as other overseas nurses arrive, arrangements are in train to place them for the experience they need. Hospitals with schools of nursing attached to them are in a position to provide for their own recruits. If agencies are experiencing problems in this regard, they should contact An Bord Altranais, who will furnish them with the names of hospitals that are able to provide the experience necessary for registration.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, has awarded a contract jointly to Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Cork to advise health boards on all aspects of fluoride use, including water fluoridation. When advice and recommendations are available from these studies appropriate consultation will take place to inform future policy on fluoride use for this country. A situation analysis will be available by the end of this year. A report from one contractor is due by end 2001 and a report from the second contractor is due by end 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure have been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects <Col N="1547" /> have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the faculty of public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.</P>

      <P>The number of private beds in acute public hospitals is 2,528. My Department's financial allocation to public hospitals is for the totality of services provided and is not broken down between services provided to public or private patients by bed. However, public hospitals apply charges for private and semi-private beds. These charges vary according to the type of hospital providing care and a table of these charges is attached.</P>
      <P>Because costs vary significantly from hospital to hospital, it is extremely difficult to state the level of state subsidy for each hospital. However, it is estimated that the private charges in Dublin teaching hospitals may be in the order of 50% of the average cost of such beds. The White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published in September 1999, considered the issue of the current level of charges applicable to private patients in public hospitals. It estimated that, taking account of the varying levels of costs between major tertiary and teaching hospitals and general hospitals, the estimated total annual cost of the subsidy is £35 million. The White Paper also proposed that the introduction of economic pricing of private beds would be introduced over a period of five to seven years.</P>

      <P>Magnetic resonance imaging facilities in the public hospital sector are available at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. This scanner services in-patients, out-patients and referrals from other health boards and hospitals. Private MRI facilities are also available at three other sites in Dublin, namely, the Mater Private Hospital, St. Vincent's Private Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic. There is also a privately owned MRI facility located on the campus of Cork University Hospital. Public hospitals refer patients to both the public and privately owned scanners. However, access for public patients to the private facilities is available on a limited basis only.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of MRI facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was commissioned by my Department from Professor David Banta, an international expert in health technology assessment. Professor Banta's findings were announced in 1997, whereby he identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital.</P>
      <P>All three hospitals have now submitted applications to my Department for the development of MRI facilities on foot of the acceptance of Professor Banta's recommendations. My Department has recently concluded discussions with the management of the three agencies concerning the installation and operational requirements for these facilities. Approval to progress with the contract arrangements for the provision of MRI facilities at the three sites will issue shortly. I am confident that this will have a positive impact on the overall waiting list and waiting times for MRI scans throughout the public health sector.</P>
      <P>MRI is of benefit in diagnosing many different illnesses, particularly neurological, musculo-skeletal and spinal illness. It avoids many invasive procedures that were previously painful and hazardous to patients.</P>

      <P>It is a matter in the first place for intending travellers to countries where certain infectious diseases are prevalent to familiarise themselves with the general advice on immunisation for travellers to the country concerned. Advice and information is obtainable through general practitioners, health boards, travel health centres, travel agents or the embassy or consulate of the country which it is intended to visit. In addition to the traditional immunisation advice, intending travellers should also consider seeking advice on a range of other issues, for example, whether they are medically fit to travel, what medical provision should be made for individuals with pre-existing illness and what general precautions should be taken in relation to eating, drinking and exposure to a different environment from that to which people are accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that under the terms of sections 10(1)(<i>e</i>) and 12(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Package <Col N="1553" /> Holidays and Travel Trade Act, 1995, amongst the information which organisers of package holidays are required to make available to possible consumers is information about health formalities required by national administrations for the journey and the stay.</P>
    <P>The notifications of infectious diseases reported by the health boards to my Department do not generally enable a distinction to be made as between conditions contracted in Ireland and those contracted abroad. However diseases not endemic in Ireland, for example, malaria, would by definition have been contracted abroad. A number of cases of this condition have been reported in Ireland each year.</P>
    <P>My Department publishes material containing general health advice for persons planning to travel abroad and this deals with the risks of infectious disease and the desirability of ensuring that intending travellers to at-risk countries obtain the appropriate vaccinations, as well as some of the other issues to which I have referred. The Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, in its <i>Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland</i>, 1999 edition, included advice to medical professionals on immunisation for persons travelling abroad. My Department has arranged for the distribution of these revised guidelines to a range of interested parties.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to people with sensory disabilities, including the establishment of resource centres for the visually impaired is a matter for the relevant health boards. In line with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been established in each health board, bringing together the statutory and voluntary sector service providers, including the national Council for the Blind of Ireland, the consumers and their representatives for the better planning and co-ordination of services at regional level. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services are decided by the health boards in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees. This year £7 million has been provided to the health boards for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has actively encouraged the <Col N="1554" /> voluntary sector in taking a partnership approach for the provision of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, and I am aware that the National Council for the Blind of Ireland is developing a collaborative approach with a number of other voluntary agencies to develop resource centres throughout the country. Currently three such centres, based in Wexford, Kilkenny and Cork city have been agreed for funding by the relevant health boards in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees. These resource centres include a provision to access the low vision needs of adults and children.</P>

      <P>Dioxins belong to a group of dangerous chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants. Dioxins are mainly by-products of industrial processes but can also result from natural processes such as volcanic eruption and are found throughout the world in air, soil, water, sediment and food. The World Health Organisation advises that long-term exposure to high levels of dioxins is linked to impairment of the human immune system, the nervous system and the reproductive system. Most human exposure to dioxins is through the food supply. Protecting the food supply is most important in safeguarding public health from dioxins. Analysis of dioxins in the environment and in food requires sophisticated methods which are available in specialised laboratories mostly in industrialised countries. The WHO, through its European Centre for Environment and Health in the Netherlands, conducts periodic studies mainly in European countries to provide an assessment of human exposure to dioxins. Data on exposure show that measures introduced to control dioxin release in a number of countries have resulted in substantial reductions in exposure to these compounds over the past few years.</P>
      <P>As dioxin compounds can be stored in the body, primarily in fatty tissues, cows milk is often taken as a sensitive indicator of the level of contamination in the food chain. The Environmental Protection Agency has conducted a study of cows milk here and has found levels of dioxin to be uniformly low and much lower than levels measured in other European countries. This survey will be repeated this year to provide up to date measurements.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. A project team at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital is currently planning the development of the transplant unit as part of a wider development programme at the hospital. Pending the completion of the overall hospital development project, an interim solution is proposed by the hospital for the programme which includes the provision of theatre and associated facilities. The hospital has recently appointed a number of key personnel to the programme, including a consultant transplant surgeon.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of an Irish based programme, an agreement has been entered into with the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. This agreement is for a two-year period and came into effect on 1 April 1999. In addition, a number of Irish patients are also attending other transplant centres in the UK.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that the Irish programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung and heart-lung transplantation.</P>

    <P>It is clear that there has been an increase in the number of nurses available for employment over the period 1996 to 1998.</P>
    <P>However, the Department's health service personnel census shows a slight decrease in nursing employment over the same period. The total number of full-time equivalent nursing staff in employment at 31 December 1998 was 26,695. The corresponding figure for 1996 was 27,264, while the 1997 figure was 27,426. However, it should be noted that these figures exclude some 550 practice nurses working with GPs in their surgeries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicates that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here.</P>
    <P>Employers have stepped-up their recruitment from abroad with significant success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, for example, in addition to on-going recruitment within Ireland.</P>
    <P>As part of the settlement of the nurses' strike, in response to the nursing shortage, the Department of Health and Children gave an undertaking to increase the annual intake of nursing students to 1,500 for the next three years. The action plan agreed with the nursing alliance provides for an increase of some 300 additional training places this year on the nursing registration/diploma programmes. The intention is that a total of 1,500 training places will be available: 1,000 in general nursing, 300 in psychiatric nursing and 200 in mental handicap nursing. This follows on from the highly successful outcome to last year's com<Col N="1590" /> petitions which resulted in a total intake of 1,215 students. This was the largest number of direct entrants to nurse training for several years.</P>

      <P>There is only one level of general nurse in Ireland, that is, registered general nurse. This is equivalent to the United Kingdom qualification of registered general nurse. The minimum qualification of training required to achieve this qualification or its equivalent throughout the European Union is laid down in EU directives.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not have a comparable qualification to the United Kingdom qualification of state enrolled nurse. Because of the minimum training requirements laid down for general nursing in EU directives, it is not possible to allow SENs to practice as RGNs here. However, holders of the SEN qualification are currently employed in Irish hospitals in other capacities, such as care assistants and ward attendants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, adult cardiac by-pass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and, since September 1998, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. I can confirm that at the end of March 2000, the most recent period for which information is available, there was a total of 624 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and 238 waiting for three to 12 months. This represents a reduction of 192 when compared with the figures, as at end of December 1999, of 816 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and a reduction of 60 when compared with the end of December 1999 figure of 298 awaiting cardiac surgery for three to 12 months. There was a total of 69 children awaiting cardiac surgery over six months, and six waiting for three to six months as at 31 March 2000. The total number of patients likely to receive cardiac surgery this year is estimated at 1,970. The total number of cardiac surgery operations carried out on adults and children in the years 1997, 1998, 1999 is 1,531, 1,696 and 1,703, respectively. This includes cardiac surgery procedures purchased under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiatives.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my predecessor allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list Initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, my predecessor made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list Initiative and I am making a further £4 million available in 2000. I am confident that this year's funding will build on previous years' success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has had, and will continue to have, a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients, adults and children, awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,586 in September 1997 to 937 in March 2000, which represents a reduction of 41%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery <Col N="1592" /> waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Misericordiae Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191, 192 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting list figures for the specialties requested by the Deputy as at 31 March 2000 are as follows: ENT, 7,132; cataracts, 2,959; hip replacement, 1,232.</P>
      <P>The numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 on those at the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu-like illnesses and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I announced yesterday a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be per<Col N="1593" /> formed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures, including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer-term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to take all available steps to address the short and longer-term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>The provision of school medical services, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
      <P>As a result of the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question. This review resulted in the recent publication of the report, Best Health for Children.</P>
      <P>The report recommends a core programme for child health surveillance for all primary schools involving screening of children at ages five to six years, seven to eight years and 11 to 12 years. Such screening will include measurement of growth (height and weight), testing of visual acuity and of hearing and general observation.</P>
      <P>The report also recommends selective medical examination of children with problems.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the report is a matter for the health boards. The chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national conjoint child health committee and appointed national child health co-ordinators for the purpose of overseeing implementation of the recommendations of the report in the health boards. The co-ordinators have indicated that the North Western Health Board will pilot the new school medical services programme in its region later this year and report the outcome of the evaluation to the co-ordinators. The pilot programme will commence later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Environmental Protection Agency's report, Ireland's Environment: A Millennium Report. This confirms that Irish air quality is generally good, and all current national and EU air quality standards are complied with.</P>
      <P>In the case of tropospheric &ndash; low-level &ndash; ozone no air quality standards are set; instead EU Directive 92/72/EEC on air pollution by ozone establishes thresholds for ozone in air above which there may be effects on human health and vegetation. Provision is made for the reporting of exceedances to the European Commission, and in certain circumstances, for the issuing of public information or public warnings. The thresholds are broadly consistent with guide values promulgated by the World Health Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public information requirements are triggered by a population information threshold of 180 micrograms of ozone per cubic metre of air &ndash;&micro;g/m3 &ndash; and a population warning threshold of 360  &micro;g/m3, both averaged over one hour. No public information measures are required for exceedances of a lower, reporting only, threshold for the protection of human health of 110 &micro;g/m3 <Col N="1595" /> measured over an eight-hour averaging period. There has been no exceedance in Ireland of the population warning threshold, or of the population information threshold since 1995. However, the lower, reporting, threshold was exceeded 17 times over ten days in 1998. This contrasts sharply with the situation in many European countries where the population information and population warning thresholds are regularly exceeded, and the lower reporting threshold is exceeded on as many as 50 days per annum in many central and southern European countries.</P>
    <P>The EPA report states that levels of tropospheric ozone recorded in Ireland are normally very low and Ireland, quite unlike many European countries, does not have an environmental problem with this pollutant. The EPA concludes that ozone is not the threat to human health in Ireland that it is in many European countries.</P>

It is a matter for each authority to put in place the necessary arrangements for their effective implementation, including inspection and any follow up action necessary. I am anxious to see full compliance with the regulations and, in this regard, my Department has urged local authorities to take all available measures necessary to ensure landlords comply with the regulations. The capacity of local authorities to enforce the various rented housing regulations had been adversely affected by suc<Col N="1596" /> cessful court challenges by landlords to the registration regulations. These difficulties have now been addressed by the introduction of amending regulations early this year, leaving the way clear for authorities to actively pursue their enforcement.</P>

      <P>): Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable varies depending on which category of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his-her dependants.</P>
      <P>Diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs.</P>
      <P>The present basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1997 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases.</P>
      <P>The SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations and a fundamental examination of the diet supplement will be undertaken in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last December's social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £428 million on a full year basis, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for a £4 a week increase in social welfare payments in general, including disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances have been provided as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This means that the couple rate of disability allowance have been increased by £7.80 a week &ndash; 6.7%.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases have been paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>This means that some 51,200 recipients of disability allowance received the increased rates of payment four weeks earlier than in previous years.</P>
    <P>The submission made by the National Representative Council &ndash; NRC &ndash; which proposes increasing the disability allowance to £100 a week, raises two separate issues; the adequacy of social welfare payment rates, and the question of the additional costs associated with disability.</P>
    <P>With regard to the adequacy of social welfare rates, including the rate of disability allowance, it should be noted that the recently ratified programme for prosperity and fairness provides that over the next three years all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment.</P>
    <P>The NRC has proposed that the rate of disability allowance be increased to £100 per week so as to compensate for the additional costs associated with disability. However it should be noted that, in addressing the question of these additional costs, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities distinguished between income maintenance needs and the additional costs associated with a disability.</P>
    <P>The commission recognised that people with disabilities incur additional costs regardless of whether they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or are in employment.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason they recommended that the additional costs associated with disability should be met through the introduction of a separate costs of disability payment to be administered by the Department of Health and Children and which would be paid regardless of the person's employment status.</P>
    <P>As provided for under the programme for prosperity and fairness, a working group is being established to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment. This working group, which is being chaired by the Department of Health and Children and comprises representatives of the Department of Finance and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, will consult with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the work of this group will be important in informing future policy in this area.</P>

Among their duties is the assessment of such difficulties, using a variety of <Col N="1601" /> tests, standardised and diagnostic, for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Where a pupil functions at a level that is two standard deviations below the mean on a standardised test of literacy, the pupil may be referred for psychological assessment to determine if dyslexia may be an explanatory factor. Where a pupil meets the criteria of the Department of Education and Science for dyslexia, he/she may receive additional support in a special school or special class or from a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>It is possible, with reasonable confidence, to engage in screening for dyslexia from the time pupils are in first class at the about the age of seven years.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a need to increase the number of psychologists in north Kildare to meet the need for educational psychological services and the Deputy will be glad to know that I am currently providing additional posts to expand these service, both in County Kildare and nationally.</P>
      <P>As part of this expansion, the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently completing the process of recruiting additional suitably qualified psychologists. As a result, my Department expects to in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year. This will double the present number of psychologists in the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS. Under the Government's plans, it is envisaged that all schools will have a fully operational psychological service by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Pending the expansion of NEPS, a working group of representatives from NEPS and the Department of Health and Children has been established to put procedures in place to deal with urgent referrals for psychological assessment. In the case referred to by the Deputy, an application should be made to the health board for the psychological service required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures were introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intake of trainee primary teachers to the <Col N="1604" /> colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>Persons who hold a primary degree may apply for admission to a post graduate course conducted by the primary teacher training colleges. These courses are conducted when it is deemed necessary to increase the supply of qualified primary teachers. The courses, which are generally of 18 months duration, enable a primary degree holder become fully qualified for appointment in a primary school.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C in higher level Irish in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity. Those who do not have the grade C in the leaving certificate, but who commenced employment after 1 April 2000, are paid at the trained rate for up to 14 weeks.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 644.

      <P>The Government decision dated 10 December 1999 agreed to the development of the 65 acre site at Grangegorman, Dublin 7 on a phased basis to meet the needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology. The development of the site will be carried out on a phased and prioritised basis. The Dublin Institute of Technology is currently engaged in a strategic analysis of the educational requirements for the Grangegorman facility in the context of the institute's masterplan to develop a north city campus and a south city campus.</P>
      <P>The Government decision further agreed that my Department and the Department of Finance assess the Grangegorman development to establish either the most appropriate public private partnership approach to the project or decide that a public private partnership is not appropriate. This assessment will take place on receipt of proposals from the Dublin Institute of Technology resulting from their strategic analysis.</P>

On receipt and consideration of the Inspector's report, a decision on the application will be taken as quickly as possible. The question of acquiring a site will depend upon the outcome.</P>
    <P>I should point out that it is only when a primary school has been granted permanent recognition that it becomes eligible to apply for capital grant-aid towards the cost of a school site and building. Before I can consider granting permanent recognition, I must be satisfied that, among other things, the school is likely to have a viable future.</P>
